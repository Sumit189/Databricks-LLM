"  friends' inappropriate use of a pink dildo as a prank object, involving explicit photos, decorations, and hiding it around the house.","What Absolutely Shouldn’t Be Passed Around Friends?

I once lived in a house with 6 other friends. Cheap rent, good roommates. We had parties every weekend with 50+ people. Life was good.
A buddy of our was very homophobic. His parents said they would disown him if he was gay. One of the guys in the house who knew him the best, bought a pink suction cup glow in the dark dildo. 
The idea was to stick it to the front of his truck. He would either have to touch it to get it off, or leave it. At which point we would laugh at him.
We thought it was funny, but it never happened, because he moved a couple days after it was bought. So ultimately we just had it around the house and would fuck with each other. Fall asleep on the couch? You get a pic taken with a dildo in your mouth. We stuck it to the wall and hung Christmas decorations on it. We hid it in the cupboards, place it just right so that if you open the cupboard it would fall out at you. We all got pretty good at throwing it at a wall and getting it to stick.
Some kids had Elf On A Shelf. We had Pink Dink In The Sink.
We had rotating roommates as some people started moving out and starting their lives after college. Until I was the last to leave. I left it in the shower the last day I moved out with a note. ""This is Pink Dink. He may be smol but he can bring so much joy to the world if you use him properly.” All friend groups should have their own Pink Dink."
  a concerned parent discovers evidence suggesting their teenage son may have engaged in inappropriate behavior with their family dog.,"My son got intimate with our dog

The last couple of weeks my dog (7 year old lab) has been acting noticeably different. I guess I could describe it as ""distant"" and even depressed. He is normally an extremely outgoing and happy dog, very playful and energetic etc. But starting about 2 weeks ago he started acting very withdrawn and nervous around people, even his own family. At first I kind of brushed it off as feeling under the weather, but after about a week and a half I decided maybe he needed to see a vet.
I got him in yesterday and after an examination the vet told me that he believes the dog has been taken advantage of in an intimate way. His butt had slight damage in a way that was consistent with that sort of thing. He said he can't really imagine that his injuries could have come about any other way. So already now I'm pretty upset and sort of freaking out. Who would do this sort of thing to a dog?
I thought about all of the people that had access to the dog and my back yard. Gardeners crossed my mind, my neighbors, etc. The only people that live in the house are my wife, myself, and our teenaged son. I came home and thought about it for a while. I had this really ugly sinking feeling in my stomach about the possibility that it could have been my son. I decided to look around his room.
I didn't really know what I was expecting to find, and I didn't really find anything in there that screamed guilty, until I decided to check his browser history. I found he had been on a forum recently and a site with pictures of that sort of thing. I felt like I was going to throw up.
Now I know that this isn't definitive proof of anything, but it sure doesn't look good. The more I think about it, the more I am convinced my son has been fiddling our dog. I haven't told my wife yet or done anything about it. I have Not left him alone with the dog since. I am totally confused and upset and don't really know how to proceed with this.

"  guy's cheap Secret Santa gifts and complaints about catered lunches made him the most hated person in the workplace.




","Who is the most hated person in your workplace and why?

Tim was the guy everybody hated; he was lucky we all felt bad for his quirks. Every working day Tim punched in exactly at 8:00AM and out at 5:00PM, in between those hours you were lucky if you saw him working. It was because of him we no longer had Secret Santa during the holidays, catered monthly lunches, or Holiday Bonuses.
Secret Santa Tim was quite frugal, and when I say quite, I mean he was cheap as f***. Every employee in the company voted the dollar amount they wanted to spend on another for the Secret Santa, the avg. dollar amount came out to $50. Tim's vote was $1, I recognized his shitty handwriting. Everyone, including Tim, agreed to spend around that dollar amount. When it came down to opening presents, it was clear everybody went over that amount. Tim received a pair of tickets to a Dodger's Baseball game plus some Dodgers t-shirts, and a hat, the tickets were face valued at $175 each(his secret santa had season tickets and gifted him a pair from his set). When it came down for Tim to give his gift, I wondered who he gotten...he got his desk buddy. Jesse was the sweetest girl in the office, she worked with everyone and was the most polite, respectful, soft-spoken human I've ever met. When she opened her gift, I wanted to die. He got her lingerie. Not just any lingerie, crotchless, matching bra and without any tags. Jessie was 5'9"" and athletic, whoever those clothes were for was someone athletically challenged. HR had a hay-day with that one.
Catered Lunch The last Friday of every month featured Catered Lunch with an short work day. It always revolved so that things never felt redundant - Mexican, Italian, BBQ, Pizza or Chinese. Tim religiously ate Mexican food. When the chosen Mexican restaraunt was catering, Tim was first in line to eat. He would wait around the time clock near the patio doors so that when 1:00PM hit, his hand was being scanned with one foot out the door. When it was any of the other catered meals, he made it known that he was irritated that so-and-so were catering. May 2013 I got to choose what we were having and I chose Italian since my birthday was the following day. Tim was seriously pissed about having Italian food, mind you for the next two months the choices were Italian or Chinese, so Mexican was no where near the table. Eventually everyone heard a bit of his ramblings and then it hit the ears of the company chairmen. They called the heads of every dept in and asked about Tim's feeling and how long this had gone on for. I explained how Tim was a quirky guy, but for some reason only liked Mexican food. Next morning there was an announcement that we were no longer having company lunches, this meant no more going home at 2PM, and no more lunch for the office. Everyone was pissed.
Holiday Bonuses This is what got the ball rolling for Tim's demise. Our company manufactured steel products and shipped them to different distribution warehouses. Nobody in our office worked in sales, so nobody had commission based pay. Every year before our 2 week holiday vacation we received our last checks for the year and a bonus. The bonus was a percentage of the profits divided up between all employees. It was great. Who doesn't like more money right before the holiday season? Tim, that's who. This particular year had been a bad one for us, profits were down 10% due to one of our distributors filing bankruptcy. So our bonuses were not as big as before, but they still equated to a paycheck's value. Everyone, other than Tim, was estatic they were still receiving bonuses. When Tim opened his check, hell broke loose. I've never seen someone so pissed about a bonus check in my life. First he goes around asking everyone how much they received(we all received the same amount), but nobody wanted to show him their check. Then he tries to talk to his desk-mates about receiving less than last year and this is where it goes downhill. Everyone he asks tells him they received more than last years amount. You can see where this is going now. After everyone's gone for the day and a few of us stay to clean up the Holiday Party mess, Tim rushes the company owner and lays it into him on why he received a lower bonus, that he feels under-valued, he should be asking for a raise. We can hear him yell through a closed window to the outside. The holidays pass and Tim is as happy as ever, all dept heads get called into what seemed like a normal Monday after the holidays meeting and we're told the yearly bonus structure will no longer continue at our branch. Everybody knew why. A month later Jesse finally got him fired after bringing light to several s xual harassment instances revolving around Tim.

"  psychopath parent views children as possessions, trains and molds them, but does not experience love. Emphasizes practicality, education, and success.","Do psychopaths love their children?

No, I do not ""love"" my children but they certainly believe that i do. I view my children as possessions. This is going to ""sound awful but I view them as pets/dolls of sorts. They are mine to train, teach, and mold.
 I told them what to do, and they did it. Period
 I answered their questions, but they knew to ask them in private (not in public). I generally did not lie when answering these questions.
For example They ask, ""Where do babies come from?"" I had the sex talk with them. However, if they were to ask, ""Mum, do you love us?"" I would of course, say something along the lines of, ""With all my heart!"" because I recognized that they have feelings and I do not and I want my ""pets"" to be happy and content. I have no wish to do them emotional harm.
They were never permitted to believe in Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, or any other such nonsense.
They began learning meditation and yoga when they were very young. daughter, age 2; son, age 3.
People that interacted with my (young) children were not permitted to use sarcasm when communicating with them or ""joke"" with them.
Young children do not understand sarcasm and ""joking around."" I allowed them to learn it with their peers at school (which was about
5th/6th grade).
 My children were taught about all different kinds of religion and they were permitted to choose whichever one they felt suited them best. (My daughter chose Wicca and my son is ""spiritual"").
My children are well-behaved, graduated with honors (both high school and college), and have successful, blooming careers in their prospective fields. They understand how to play the game without being overshadowed and consumed by the game. They were trained to be wolves, not sheep. Although I am proud that they are mine and I approve of them, I do not love them."
"  a former security worker recalls a terrifying experience with a massive, psychotic MMA fighter patient who exhibited unpredictable behavior.","Psychologists, what patient have you been genuinely terrified of?

Not a psychologist but I used to work in a psych ward as security.
We had this huge guy with schizophrenia detained in 1s, which is the ward for those who have been legally determined to be unfit and are not allowed to leave.
When I say huge, I mean he was like 6'5, gigantic muscles and he used to be an MMA fighter. Real nice guy when medicated but when in psychosis, he was not someone you'd want to go toe to toe with. We would sometimes have to call police to help us deal with him. One officer would arrive, take a look at him and go ""nope"" and call for backup.
So one day I was guarding the entrance to 1s. He was doing fairly okay so he wasn't confined to his room and was allowed to walk around the supervised communal space.
He puts down his magazine, goes into his room and then walks out naked. Dude walks up to me, stands about an inch away and looks down at me. I mean way down, as I'm only 5'3.
He tells me he's leaving
I asked if he would like some shoes or a gown. He says no, he's leaving and I better step aside
So I did. You better believe I stepped the f aside and let him walk out.
I followed him at a safe distance through the psych ward (where everyone basically pinned themselves against the wall to get away) and out into the parking lot while on the call with the cops. I can't leave the grounds so once he was off hospital property, I could only inform the police to which way he was running..which was down into a heavily populated downtown core.
Not even 15 min later, he comes back and walks back into the lobby of the ward and asks for me. He wants shoes after all. Not a robe, but shoes. So I bring him shoes to prevent him from getting violent and off he goes again as I repeat the process, following him to the edge of the grounds and calling the cops
Cops bring him back and put him into his secure room. However once he is in there, they are not allowed to restrain past a certain point. So the whole security team assembles, which is me and about 5 men. They decide I'm to hold a leg as I'm small and legs are easier to restrain. So we go into the room in a triangle formation with me as the last to enter. He must have missed when I came in the door, because he started screaming that I was a shape shifter and freaking out.
It took us about 30 minutes of restraining him before he was medicated enough to calm down
Fast forward maybe two years later. I'm no longer security or live in the town, but I went for a metal show. I joked to friends that I was worried someone I had dealt with in the hospital might recognize me and have bad memories.
Lo and behold, there is MMA fighter taking shots at the bar. Now I know that he shouldn't be drinking with his meds but hey, it's been two years and I don't know anything about his current health status so whatever. I still tried to avoid him in case he remembered my shape shifting.
At one point our lines to the bar coincided, and I ended up standing next to him. He looked up at me, looked down and then looked back up and stared. Hard. I could tell he recognized me but I could also tell that he was trying to figure out from where. The entire night I could see him lingering around me, staring with this befuddled expression on his face"
" from r/askreddit a young child witnessed his sister's painful battle with pancreatic cancer, including chemotherapy, hair loss, and her passing on his birthday.","What is the saddest thing you've ever seen?

When i was 12 years old my sister (she was 16) she began to experience abdominal pain. She never really told anyone about it except me (we were super close, like inseparable close). She thought that it was just because of her periods. As the months started to grow, so did her pain. I was freaked out so I suggested that we tell our mom but she said that she didn’t want to burden my parents (we were at a financial loss at that time). So after about 65 days she couldn’t hold on so she decided to tell my mom. My mom got an appointment immediately and we rushed to the ER (Emergency Room). My sister was wailing in pain. The docs over there took an ultrasound scan and then an MRI and a couple of other scans, at this point my mom and I were crying that’s when they revealed that my sister had Pancreatic Cancer and that it had crossed Stage III. My mom literally fainted right there. I was alone and scared and i had heard about cancer only in stories and books like fault in our stars. But when my sister was a victim i didn’t know how to react. When my mom regained consciousness and calmed down, they told her that my sister was given a few painkillers and anesthesia for the time being and that we had to start with chemotherapy soon but that they were not sure that it would work. My sister did not know that she had cancer, the doc explained it to her usually merry face broke down. They started chemo and her beautiful black locks which she was proud of slowly began to fall. She was a person of positivity so she told my mom that she wanted to EXPERIMENT her hair. She had hip length hair which she cut it to a bob then a pixie and then finally shaved her head. We both shaved our heads together. She would never get a minute of sleep at night. On the 12th of December, it was my birthday, I ran home from school happily as my friends had given me a lot of gifts for my sister and me. My dad was there, my mom wasn't, my sister was at the hospital, so I asked my dad to drive me to the hospital as I wanted to give the gifts to my sister. My dad was looking really depressed but he agreed. When I reached my sisters room, she was screaming out of pain my mom was screaming for the docs. I went near my sister slowly she smiled at me even with too much pain. Her last words to me were, “I love you, take care of tiger (our 1 year old dog) and mom and dad, it's time for me to see grandma and grandpa in heaven”. She died at 16:07pm on my birthday. I cried for almost a month and I still cry for her every single day but not in front of my parents because I know that if I cry they will cry too. I hope she found a peaceful place!"
"  in jail, an inmate's disturbing behavior led to his confinement in the ""Blue Burrito"" for 12 hours, breaking him mentally.","Ex-Prisoners, what was the worst thing you saw inside?

I spent a couple weeks in county jail. On the first day, when we were all being processed into the facility, we were told very succinctly to never ever even joke about taking your life while in the facility. Kind of like how you just don't say ""bomb"" on an aeroplane anymore. By day three, I had a good understanding of the other guys I was locked up with. I was physically the biggest of the white guys in our ""pod"" so all the white kids huddled around my table at meals. There was one kid in the group that seemed underdeveloped mentally, he probably had a learning disability among other things, but he essentially acted like a 12 year old. I knew early on he was going to get himself in trouble because he never stopped talking or moving, and he was rubbing everyone the wrong way. I tried to tell him to chill out and be invisible, but he was not understanding what I was telling him. I had been there a week, when the ""12 year old"" finally lost his cool completely. He was in the shower, singing and joking around, putting on a performance that went too far, and he pooped on the floor as a joke. After the other guys in the shower grabbed their towels and ran, he proceeded to kick the poop all over the walls and into the other shower stalls. It turned into a big scene, and then when the ""trustees"" came in to clean up the poop all over the walls it turned into an even bigger scene. The whole time, the ""12 year old"" was locked in a cell near the showers, laughing and joking as other inmates had to clean up his poop and make the shower area sanitary again. State run facilities have standards after all! The next day, everyone was looking at the ""12 year old"" with hate in their eyes. Everyone missed their showers the day prior due to the poop incident, and then the kid was still up to his antics at breakfast the next day. Everyone got really cold toward him, even openly mean. I'll admit, I started ignoring him completely after the poop. It took him a day or two to realize he was hated by all, and then his personality changed dramatically. He became sad, despondent, and started talking to the COs because the other inmates wouldn't talk to him anymore. He messed up, and told the COs that he should just take his life and make everyone happy, and that was all it took, they dragged out the Blue Burrito. This is the scariest thing I had seen in jail. The Blue Burrito was a 10 foot long blue foam mat. They laid it out on the floor, forced the ""12 year old"" to lay on the mat, and then they rolled him up with his arms at his sides into the blue burrito. The two long red belts clipped together at the top and bottom of the burrito keeping it all nice and tight. This was the protocol at the jail. No counselling, no medical ward. You lose the ability to move. They put that poor guy in the burrito around 8 P M, dragged him into his cell and left him laying on the floor, wrapped up tight, until breakfast the next morning, around 8:00 A M. Imagine being unable to move, barely able to breath, with no end in sight for 12 hours on the floor of your 8 by 8 cell. My cell was up above his, and I heard him weeping and moaning in agony all night. He didn't say a word to anyone, or look anyone in the eye for that matter for the rest of the time I was there. One night in the blue burrito broke him."
"  a investigator scammed by rich client, who exposes client's infidelity, helps wife secure divorce settlement, and starts dating her.




","A guy scammed me so I ruined his life. 

A guy scammed me so I ruined his life. I am a private investigator and about three years ago, I was hired to do a personal contract. The client, a rich sleazy snob, was apparently stupidly rich. He hired my unit. He believed his wife was cheating on him with other people, and he wanted proof of this so he could start his divorce process with solid evidence. He contracted us for a six month contract, and was to pay the company x amount of dollars upon completion. So we set up surveillance cameras all over his large house and in the wife's car with the client's permission. We had at least one of the team tailing her at all times. Day in and out, we watched their lives, and in this line of work, you either get detached or emotionally invested, like watching a soap opera. As we watched them, we quickly saw this lady was a saint. She volunteered at a soup kitchen and a children's hospital. She helped local churches' with canned food drives. Those kinds of things. She was the perfect definition of what a good human should be. On the other hand, the husband was a total sleaze. He was the one we caught many times bringing women to his house. Sometimes, he would bring two or three girls in one day. And that is only what was recorded in the house. We arrived at the four month mark, which is basically where we show all the evidence and give the updated report. We show him everything that we found and have a six hour debrief with video and audio support, showing that she hadn't done anything wrong other than a speeding ticket and a few double parking situations. After we concluded the debrief, he looked stupefied. He says, ""So you didn't catch her cheating? What was the point of me hiring you?"" My boss, our captain, turns to him with a serious stare, which is perhaps in the most serious and badass looking face I have ever seen in that man, and said, ""You hired us to investigate your wife. You're unhappy that your wife is an honest and faithful woman?"" The snob is visibly annoyed. He stands up and is getting his jacket when my captain says, ""Look, there is still two months on the contract. We will keep tailing her, and we'll meet again after our contract is up and give you any updates."" The snob turns to him and says, ""Don't bother. This is over. I'm ending it. Come when she is not home and get your equipment out."" So a week later we did exactly that. Now, when contracts like this are made, a small portion is paid up front as commission fee, and the rest is paid at the end of the contract's allotted time. In his case, it is six months. So fast forward to the next payday after the contract is officially over. My unit gets a call from our office to come in on the next pay day as there is an emergency meeting regarding us and the last contract. We get there and find out the snob pulled the funding and refused to pay us for the work. So we're getting paid, just not with the completion bonus. We all left super angry. We went to lunch and brainstormed how to get even with the devient. Then we remembered all the house footage of his dirty deeds. At first we wanted to blackmail him, but that's low and we're better than that. I remembered the wife, so I reached out to her. I set a date to sit down and explain everything to her. I showed her the videos. She cried for a good half hour. I think I broke her whole world. It was gut wrenching. I then advised her to get a lawyer and proceeded to give her a copy of all the collected evidence and my business card. Fast forward about six months. I'm called into court, as my company is suing him for fraud, breach of contract, and unpaid dues. My company wins the case easily, as his lawyer's argument was that we failed to deliver the result he wanted. But we weren't hired to deliver a product. We were hired to observe and report. We got paid in the end. I was contacted as I was leaving the court house by the wife who thanked me for all the evidence. She got a divorce. Because of all the evidence I gave her, she got almost everything: his huge house, both cars, and a huge cash sum. We coincidentally bumped into each other again about 6 months later in the local mall. We caught up over coffee and we are currently dating. It’s so comforting to know you can trust someone."
"  stepdaughter wants her biological father to give her away at the wedding, leaving her stepfather feeling disrespected and unappreciated.




","My step daughter wants her real dad to give her away

My step daughter will be getting married on August 3rd. The wedding planning has consumed most of her and her mother's life for the past six months. My step daughter graduated last December from University. I paid for her to go to college, though it was a state school, it still ran 40K. She does not have a job and has been living with us for the duration of her college career and since her graduation. I also bought her a car to get back and forth from school when she finished high school. From time to time her deadbeat father would pop into her life and she would fawn all over him. Although he has not contributed a cent to her education or paid any child support, though that is my girlfriend's fault as child support was not part of the settlement, she still loves him and wants him in her life. He stays long enough to break her heart by skipping town and breaking some promise that he made her. The wedding venue holds 250 people max. I gave them a list of 20 people that I wanted invited, you know, since I was paying for everything. They told me that was no problem and they'd take care of it. So I let these people know they'd be getting an invite and they should save the date. Saturday, I saw one of my friends on this list at the golf course and asked if he was coming. He told me that he wasn't invited. He told me that he got an announcement, but not an invitation. He had it in his back seat and showed it to me. Sure enough, it was just an announcement, and my name was nowhere on it. It had her dad's name and her mom's name and not mine. This led to a pretty big fight with my girlfriend, as I found out that none of my list of twenty ""made the cut"" for the final guest list because ""250 people is very tight."" I was pissed, but not a hell of a lot I could do because the important people in my life had already been offended. My girlfriend said ""if some people didn't RSVP yes, I might be able to get a couple people in."" But that is an ultimate slap in the face in my opinion. So, I was boiling on Saturday. Yesterday, we had a Sunday dinner with the future in-law's family and us and a surprise guest, the ""Real Dad."" At this little dinner my step-daughter announced that her ""Real Dad"" was going to be able to make it to her wedding and that now he'd be able to give her away. This was greeted with a chorus of ""Oh how great"" and ""How wonderful""s. I don't think I have ever felt so angry and so disrespected. I was shaking. I took a few seconds to gather my composure, because I honestly wasn't sure if I would cry or start throwing punches or both. Once I was sure I'd be able to speak I got up from my chair and said I'd like to make a toast. I can't remember exactly what I said but the gist of it was this: “I'd like to make a toast. It has been my great pleasure to be a part of this family for the past ten years. At this point in my life I feel I owe a debt of gratitude to the bride and groom, because they have opened my eyes to something very important."" Confident smiles exchanged. ""They have shown me that my position in this family is not what I once thought it was."" And now a glimmer of confusion and shock begins to spread on the faces in the room. ""Though I once thought of myself as the patriarch or godfather of the family, commanding great respect and sought out for help in times of need, it seems instead that I hold the position of an ATM, good for a stream of money, but not much else. As I have been replaced as host, both on the invitations and in the ceremony, I am resigning my financial duties as host to my successor, Real Dad. So cheers to the happy couple and the path they have chosen."" I finished my drink. ""You all can let yourselves out.""

"  a marine's snowy encounter with Norwegian school children turns into a chaotic snowball fight, leaving him freezing and bewildered.




","Why do you hate children?

In the U S Marines, doing a mock war in the Norwegian city of Trondheim with the Dutch, Germans and other allies, training in urban combat. My infantry unit was positioned in a large soccer field next to an elementary school. Keep in mind there was no actual combat, even simulated; it was mostly just practicing maneuvers and tactics. But we still looked out of place with weapons and gear, etc. It's February. In Norway. Cold as balls. Snow up to our knees. Norway obviously has no snow days, so the kids were all in school. Anyway, Norway has this most delicious and amazing delicacy, I have no idea what it's called, but it's basically a bacon-wrapped hot dog; we just assumed it was called Candy of the Lord. As Americans we were naturally and instantly addicted. You find them at gas stations, and there just happened to be one on the other side of the school where we were camped. A few of my fellow Marines and I requested permission to go to the gas station and we set out on our way. We made it to right about where the main entrance of the school was, and the doors opened; school was out. There were only a few kids, probably 6 or 7 years old. Lots of talking and laughing. Gawking at us as we walked by, with our guns and huge ridiculous snow suits. One precocious little bugger made shooting noises at us. We made shooting noises back. And then someone in my group. I don't know who. God help me I don't know who. Someone threw a snowball and hit a little girl in the leg. And those little Norwegian children unleashed hell. There was a shrill cry in unintelligible Norseman and the doors to the school burst open. School children flooded out like a never ending flood of something that never ends. Screeching, smiling, sprinting - how the f were they sprinting?? - little shits were slinging snowballs faster than the laws of physics should allow. It was like that movie Elf. If you can imagine riding in a fast car in a snowstorm and sticking your head out the window. Now imagine the snowflakes that are hitting your face are the size of snowballs. We couldn't f’ing see. We couldn't run. We could barely breathe. Holy f. We tried to return fire and threw one, maybe two half-packed, shitty snowballs that fell apart in the air, arms flailing like drunk octopi. I am from Texas. We were a unit stationed in North Carolina. We were so outmatched and out of our element, it only made them laugh harder. We were cutoff from our main forces. We tried to perform a flanking maneuver but f me they were fast. I think some of them were throwing rocks! My comrades. I could see them speed waddling in their huge suits back to camp like a f’ed up pair of white Teletubbies, under withering fire. F tactics, f me, f the Candy of the Lord, this was survival! I was the slow one in the group. My snow boots were too big but they were the smallest size they had at Issue goddammit!! My Marines left me behind. I tried pulling my hood over my head and keeping my head down. No longer content to pelt my defenseless body with ballistic snow, the enemy swarmed me and dragged me down, cackling like a pack of hyenas descending on a wildebeest. I tried to sling them off by spinning. I came out of one of my boots and fell. I began to scream and plead for them to stop but they neither understood nor gave a single Nordic f. They literally pinned me down with about five kids on each limb. It was then that I actually thought - oh shit. I'm really in trouble. My snow-mittens were ripped off and flung into trees. They started shoving snow down my suit. Have you ever had anyone drop an ice cube down your shirt? Well now imagine someone shoveling handfuls of ice cubes down your shirt. It literally shocked the breath out of my body. They left me laying like a Family Guy accident victim. Moaning and screaming in the cold. Rifle packed with snow and dirt. Boot buried somewhere. They ran away laughing, jabbering in their crazy language. I lay there trying to figure out just what in the great American f had happened.

"  paying overdue property taxes, targeting bankrupt individuals, acquiring their forfeited properties, selling for profit—unethical legal method for quick wealth.




","What is an unethical, but legal, way to get rich quick?

Go to your states Treasury website. There you can see properties that are overdue on property tax. In most states, if you pay that overdue property tax, the owner of the property typically has a time limit to pay you back your money, or forfeit the property.
What this means is, worst case, you get your money back + interest. But more than likely, if you're able to target someone going through bankruptcy, they'll end up having to forfeit their property to you. Then you can sell it once a new deed or title is issued by the state. Typically for significantly more than the back taxes you paid for it.
There are some issues. If it's someone's primary residence, you'll pretty much have to hire a lawyer to fight them on squatters rights. If it's a car, good luck ever finding it. They'll just drive away and be in trouble next time they get pulled over.
Secondary properties are ideal. But those don't come along super often. As people who can afford multiple properties usually know enough to pay their taxes.
Anyways, you can start with cars for a few hundred dollars. Houses and other properties cost a few thousand.
If you don't mind being a scumbag kicking people out of their homes when they're at one of the lowest points in their life, it can be quite lucrative.

"  police officer friend seeks medical advice after dog bite, awkwardly caught with pants down in front of friend's spouse.




","What’s your worst “I know this looks bad, but I can explain” moment?

A female friend of mine who is a Police Officer was on a welfare check and was bit by the property owners dog. She was about a mile from my house when bit and because I am an emergency medical technician she decided to call me to see if I could inspect where she was bitten and advise if she needed to go to the hospital. She show up at my house and limps into the kitchen telling me the dog bit her just below her left butt cheek on the rear of her upper thigh. I was worried that the bite had broke the skin and she would need to get it bandaged and possibly get a rabies shot. I told her that I would have to take a look at the bite to help her so, she takes off her duty belt and pulls her pants down to around her knees to expose the bite area. It didn't look too bad but there were two spots where the dogs teeth had broke the skin. I told her I would bandage it up so she could make the 20 minute drive to the clinic. I was just about to bandage her leg when my wife walks through the door. There I am with one of our female friends, standing in our kitchen, in her police officer uniform, pants down (she was wearing a thong), I was sitting so basically her ass was in my face, and my hands on her upper thigh/butt. We both had the deer in the headlight stare as we realized how bad this must have looked to my wife. We then both shouted out in unison ""It was a dog bite!"".

","Men who proposed and she said no, what happened afterwards with your life?

My friend A had been with his girlfriend B for years, so he decided he wanted to propose. What he didn't know is that B was also thinking about proposing to him. A proposed first, and B freaked out because she had already set her proposal and bought a ring, so she said no. Over the next week, B freaked out more and more, and refused to answer A's calls and messages. A then decided to use the money he had saved up to buy a plane ticket to Europe.

"  guy's ex-wife contacts him to reveal mistreatment by her affair partner, after their divorce years ago.","My ex-wife contacted me out of the blue to tell me her affair partner mistreats her. 

I'm 31 and my ex-wife ""Claire"" is 35. We were married ten years ago right when I turned 21 and graduated college. We were married for five years. During my whole marriage, I thought we were happy. I certainly was, anyway. I worked in the IT field and still do. We never got into fights during our marriage and our intimate life seemed to be satisfying. A couple of months before I finally caught her with her affair partner, she turned cold to me. Whereas before she had loved to initiate intimacy and loved having it with me, suddenly we tapered off. Every day turned into once a week, then for the last two weeks before I outed her, not at all. I caught her because she had left her phone out and it was still open to a naked selfie that she had sent to a number I didn't know. Although I was crushed I kept my head on and took photos of her with my phone. I saw her message stream with her boyfriend, some guy from the gym that I was paying her bill for. I didn't confront her. The texts told me all I needed to know. They had been screwing while I was at work, in MY bed.I just kept quiet, then the following Saturday when I knew she would be at her supposed ""double yoga class and that's why I'll be gone three hours"" I loaded my stuff into my car and left. I had talked to a divorce attorney and I  would be fine. I was 25 and didn't have serious money. Her father had passed away and left her like 200k so she was rolling in dough. I had no claim on that money, nor should I have had one. We had no kids, although she had always claimed we would start having kids when she turned 30. That birthday came and went but rather than start having kids with me she decided to just spread her legs for someone else. Although I was the sole income earner, she was in possession of a VAST amount of money (by my standards) and also had a college degree and was a schoolteacher for two years before we got married. The divorce papers were left on the kitchen table. She of course blew up my phone later with all kinds of apologies and begging and pleading but I ignored her. A lot of her friends tried to call me and left nasty messages about how I was a coward and never loved her otherwise how could I ghost her. I ignored all of them. The only person I called was the guy's wife, who promptly dumped him. But I guess it worked out for my ex because she and her boyfriend got married just a few months after the divorce finalized. The only time I ever saw her again was in front of the judge to end our divorce case where I had to pay zero alimony and it was a clean break. She never looked at me once but kept her head down. She brought her boyfriend from the gym and he was flexing trying to look hard like he was going to fight me. I just shook my head at him and thought he gets what he pays for. I've been on dates since then and have had intimacy a few times since then but have never been in a long term relationship since. This was my own choice. In a lot of ways I'm not over my relationship with her. I don't love her anymore but I'm turned off from loving anyone now. I reconnected with some of my friends I had neglected during my marriage since my wife disapproved of me being friends with ANYONE. Facebook used to be an app I used but pretty much anyone I care about I already see and converse with face to face or on the phone so I never use it anymore. Apparently Claire had spun a narrative that I was mentally abusive and that's why she had no choice but to leave me for an affair partner. My parents didn't buy it, and my close associates didn't buy it, either. But she tried selling that crap to my boss to get me fired, I guess as revenge against me ruining her boyfriend's marriage. Ironic, that she caped for his marriage, when it was his new bachelorhood that helped make a relatively honest woman out of her. I just showed my boss the texts where my ex begged for mercy and forgiveness and admitted she was having an affair and that I was a good husband etc. He just told me he was sorry, and gave me two weeks paid off to rest."
"  public humiliation: A man indulges in a jalapeno-loaded lunch, resulting in a catastrophic bathroom emergency, leaving a trail of destruction.","What is the most horrific thing you have done in public?

One afternoon at lunch I went to hang out with my then wife where she worked at a convenience store. At lunchtime, I decided to grab some nachos. I got the plate of chips and smothered them in cheese and then topped them off with a layer of jalapenos. I started to eat the nachos, one chip at a time, with a gob of cheese and one slice of jalapeno for each chip. For some reason, I couldn't get enough, they tasted so amazing! I had more chips than jalapenos, and quickly ran out. I went back to the condiment bar and loaded up more jalapenos, so that I could continue my one jalapeno per chip regiment. I finished the nachos and all in all, I would say that I probably consumed six to seven complete jalapenos by the time I was done.
Day goes on, kids get out of school, wife gets off work, and off we go to dinner at the all you can eat Chinese food place that had become our once a month custom. About halfway through dinner, my stomach started making a few little gurgling sounds. I brushed it off and continued my dinner. As we were about to leave, I suddenly felt my stomach knot up and it nearly took me to my knees. I told the wife and kids to give me a minute as I headed to the bathroom. Now the fun begins. I get into the bathroom and BARELY get my pants down in time to EXPLODE into the toilet. It was not for the faint of heart. The red hot liquid fire that was shooting out of me like a flamethrower nearly brought me to tears. I finished up (so I thought), and headed out, grabbed the family, got in the minivan (Ford Windstar) and we headed home. Two blocks away from the Chinese restaurant and I realize that 1) I'm not done, and 2) I'm NEVER going to make it home. I squeeze my butt cheeks and hold on for dear life as I drive onward. A few blocks up and I see my salvation, a Burger King restaurant. I pull in, slam the brakes, jump out, and butt cheek clench waddle as fast as humanly possible to the bathroom. I'd like to say at this point that I got my pants all the way down and got all the way seated on the toilet before I started shooting liquid hot magma out of my butt, but alas, I cannot. I essentially sprayed the toilet and the wall behind it with a coating of Satan's jelly. I nearly ran them out of toilet paper cleaning up after myself and once again into the fray I went.
Back out in the van, the wife and kids are chuckling at my predicament, as they realize that I'm suffering pretty badly. I get back behind the wheel, exhausted, with my butt on absolute fire, and begin the trek home. As you may have guessed, I was still not done expelling whatever demons were in my bowels, and it only took a few more blocks before I was driving with my legs locked tight, working with all my might to clench my butt cheeks. I was locked so tight that the only thing that was touching the seat was the back of my legs on the bottom of the seat and my shoulder blades on the top of the seat. By now, my family is ROARING in laughter, and the louder I screamed ""IT'S NOT FUNNY!"", the harder and harder they laughed. I was in excruciating pain, but for some reason, I convinced myself I could make it home. Oh, the best laid plans of mice and men. A few blocks from the house I could hold on no more, and little squirts of molten lava started seeping out of me. I get home, slam the van in park, jump out, crapping a little when I hit the ground, and start running into the house, crapping a little with each step. I get into the house, get to the bathroom, put my back to the toilet, rip my pants down and proceed to give the toilet and the wall behind it a nice new coating of what can only be described in the physical realm as 'pure evil'. As I sat there trembling and crying in pain, my kids were outside the bathroom yelling ""Are you alright dad?""...""Need us to come in and help you dad?""...yes, they are spawns of Satan himself.
At the time, I did not see ANY humor in it, but now, reflecting back, I suppose I would be laughing as well, it must have been hilarious to see the look of pure terror on my face, see the sweat running down my forehead, and most of all, the butt clench run/walk from the van to the Burger King and the van to the house. Anyway, I destroyed three bathrooms and any respect my kids may have ever had for me in one evening."
"  a challenging childhood, working mom, food aid, limited toys, brother's lawn mowing for N64, neighbor's Christmas gift, tragic ending to mother's success.","What memory from your childhood makes you think ""wow we were poor""?

I think the time that I realized we were poor was when I was 12. My mom was working two jobs, she would get up in the morning, get me and my 3 brothers ready for school, drop us off, go to work. She would pick us up after school, take us home, tell us to be good and then go work a second job till 9 at night. All while taking weekend classes at a college. We got boxes of food every couple of weeks from one of the local churches. So we didn't do so bad for food. We didn't really have many toys. We ended up having a more wealthy family give us a big tub of legos, and that was pretty much it.
Couple things stand out for me as best memories. This one summer my brother took the lawn mower and went house to house for a month, looking to mow people's lawns for 10 a pop. He would start out at like 10 am and come home 5-6 in the evening, he was 10 mind you. He collected all this money, and, when he had enough, he bought a used N64, with like 2 games. The silly thing was, we didn't have a TV to play it on. My mom was so incredibly proud, she went and worked extra hours and got this super bad cheap 12 inch tv for us to play it on. It was the coolest thing we had until way way later.
I think it was that same year, my mom was working hard, and I knew she was saving up money for Christmas presents...but my brother got sick in October, and had to go to the doctors. I don't remember what or why he had to go, but my mom was sad a lot. We didn't have health insurance, and what little money we did have was gone.
I remember Christmas day, hearing my mom sobbing in her bedroom, door closed, and us boys just in the living room, playing. The doorbell rang, and my mom told.me to get it. It was an old guy who lived down the street from us, he had a box of toys for us. Some old, some new...The look on my mom's face was....I don't have the words. The look on his face as my mom hugged that guy and cried was awesome too.
It took my mom almost ten years to finish her degree while raising us. Her big dream finally got realized and about 7 years ago she went to work as a music teacher. She bought her own house, new car....I can't tell you how proud of her I was. This last year was the very best for her. She had started doing wonderful things, she had started writing a book about technology in the classroom, had been asked to do a presentation at the national teacher conference, and had just finished her masters.
It all changed when I received a call...she had been slaughtered."
"  a teenager sneaks out of his house to visit his girlfriend, leading to risky situations involving cars, hiding, and the janitor.","What's the dumbest thing you've done out of pure horniness?

On weekends during high school, I frequently would sneak out of the house and sneak into my girlfriend at the time's parent's house. Well, I didn't have a car or a driver's license at the time, and the only car I could use was my mom's standard Toyota Camry. This led to many situations of me being stalled out on a hill at 3am with no driver's license, but I did learn how to drive standard quite well. My mom was really confused by that.
Also, sometimes I would tell my parents I was staying the night with a friend and have my parents drop me off at school for my friends to pick me up. Well, my gf at the time lived about a mile from school, so I would just walk to her place. But when I would spend the night, I would have to hide in the closet / leave by 5am because her dad always came and checked on her before he left for work. So, that led to a couple instances of sleeping in the closet, but the best/worst was when I had to leave, but no place to stay. So before this situation, my buddy was able to obtain a copy of the key to the guy's locker room, and I happened to have it that night. So after being kicked out of her place and, of course, getting my rocks off, I walked back to school and managed to sneak into the locker room. The key I had also worked on the towel closet, so I ended up making a mattress out of pallets of clean towels. One weird thing about this closet was that there wasn't a door knob on the inside, which I was smart enough to leave the door slightly cracked so that I could make my escape in the morning. Well at some point, I was woken by a door slamming and heard footsteps. I was freaking out, so I covered myself in towels and held still. Not long after, the towel closet door opens and my heart stops. I can't see anything and I can only assume it's the janitor making his rounds. Suddenly, something slightly heavy, but soft hits me straight in the face. I managed to lay still and I quickly realized he was tossing bundles of clean towels in. Right before slamming the door, he let out a HUGE fart.
I escaped being seen by the janitor and at this point it was 8 AM, so I packed up to make my escape. This was the point when I realized I was locked in the towel closet after the janitor slammed the door. I had no idea what to do. It was pitch black and the only light source I had was my flip phone, and I didn't have tools to use since there were only towels. After multiple attempts at getting the door opened, I had accepted my fate that I had to wait for someone to open the door again. Ultimately, I managed to get the door open with brute force (somehow the noise didn't attract anyone) and immediately just started sprinting out of the locker room. Right as I was about to pass the last door to sweet freedom, I made eye contact with the janitor who I couldn't see up until that point because of the layout of the locker room. I freeze like a deer in headlights just long enough for him to let out ""Where the hell did you come from?"" Without a response, I ran out the door and didn't stop till I was well off of school property."
"  a young mother's sacrifices and loving words, despite her difficult life, still deeply impact her child even today.","What did your parents say to you as a kid that still affects you today?

What did your parents say to you as a kid that still affects you today? My mom had me at 13 because she was assaulted by her dad and she lived in an area where abortion was greatly discouraged. Lived with her grandma and my grandma. She tried her best to raise me but she was just too young to do anything significant. I remember with great remorse that she always worked 2 jobs to try and support me. My mom was a saint, she treated me like the most precious thing of her life. I was very good academically compared to my peers , though I didn't realize how much it made my mom happy that time. This was during my high school. I wanted to make my momma happy that's all I cared for that time. She used to watch me study late nights till 2 in the morning though I had school on 9 am. She told me “ Promise me that you will stay strong. You wake up every morning to fight the demons that left you so tired the night before, and that my love, is bravery “ Though I didn't understand what was her thoughts that time, I told her not to worry about anything and go to sleep. She was never abusive or strict towards me, she would often spoil me rotten, she loved me a lot and I loved her. My grandma died when I was pretty young and eventually we were on our own and it put a lot of stress on my mom. She was depressed and tired. Nothing had gone right in her life. She had no education or pension. She wasn't able to find husband because her situation was really undesirable and she worked 6 days a week and just didn't have time or energy to socialize. She didn't have any friends and I was all she ever had but she never took it out on me. Always she would find a way to make me happy. I remember one Christmas in particular she bought me a laptop and to do that she had to work overtime and skip meals half time. She was dangerously skinny that time. After I graduated college and moved out, She took her life. She said in her sewerslide note that she loved me more than anything and she would miss me but now I was a man of my own life Tears rolled down my face. I was devastated. She couldn't live anymore. She didn't have a reason to live anymore because she hated her life but she loved me. Rest in peace, mom.

"  man's girlfriend's incessant joking by saying ""no"" led to her saying ""no"" when he proposed, causing embarrassment and disappointment.","My girlfriend said No when I proposed so I did the Unthinkable

My (25F) girlfriend, Molly (26F) for the last... 6 months started with a joke that I've already made clear that I don't like. It consists of her saying ""No"" quickly to anything I ask.
I know it sounds silly, but I ask her to get a glass of water for me, she says no and after 1 minute, I'm almost getting up, she says she's joking and gets some water. I ask her to wash the dishes, she says no.... I say I LOVE YOU, she says no... I ask her to take her clothes, she says no. Everything is joking and after 30s/1min, she does it, but she is ""addicted"" to doing it.
I've already made it clear several times that I don't like it, even more so in I LOVE YOU (she's the only person I can say that, so it's special to me). And there are things that are serious and I need her to answer seriously. And if she says no to everything jokingly, I can't tell when she's saying a real no (it's already happened).
I keep saying this is boring and I don't like it, she stops doing it and goes back to doing it after a week. After a brief discussion because she played this prank in front of our friends (Me asking ""love, can you get me some medicine?"" and she with No kidding), she stopped doing it for 1 month.
Yesterday, we welcomed my parents, in-laws and our 2 best friends to our house. Everyone knew that I was going to propose to her and I called them, because we always planned this proposal with our loved ones attending, participating in this special day.
I asked her to marry me and she said a quick NO and I was so grumpy/panic/upset (everyone looking in shock) for 30s for her to laugh and say she was joking, finally saying YES.
I was so embarrassed and…disappointed? I put the ring box back in and said I'd take it out to cool off. I didn't even let her say anything.
She kept texting me (no answering calls), saying it was just a joke and that I knew she always did that. She said that I left an difficult situation in the house because it was very clear that I had given up on propose and did in front of my parents and in-laws. She stressed that I was making the situation uncomfortable because of a silly joke.
Well, I slept in a hotel and I'm still in it.
My parents supported me, but my in-laws calling me an a hole for giving up on proposing, disproportionately humiliating their daughter.
I just really think there's time for jokes and that moment wasn't clearly, she knew I didn't like it and decided to do it anyway. Am I the A hole?"
  man seeks revenge by dating childhood bully's mom. Develops genuine feelings but plans to assert dominance as stepdad,"I’ve entered an intimate relationship with my childhood bully's mother. It’s f ing awesome.

I'm 24 and male for context. As a young teen he used to gang up with his friends and bully me for literally no reason. Well we eventually grew up and school ended but honestly the bullying still f s with me.
About 2 months ago I recognized his mom at a bar. She's one of those young and hot moms and I'm not the shy loser I used to be. She doesn't know who I am or what her son did. She was single and we hit it off and she came to my place that night and I piped her like it was our wedding night. Even years later I f ing hate her son so much and dogging his mom has been incredible and even though I did this initially purely for revenge she's actually a wonderful person and I want to see where this goes and hopefully at least be able to be civil with him.
She told me she has a son about my age early on which I know obviously and this week she asked since we've been together for a couple months and are serious if I wanted to meet him this weekend. I said sure. We're having dinner Saturday night and I'm equally excited and nervous. I feel bad that this started as petty revenge because she deserves better than that but the fact is her son's a f ing loser. I grew up, I got in better shape, I have a decent job and make good money while he still lives with his mommy and doesn't work.
Well he's going to be in for a big surprise this weekend. She mentioned he was already uncomfortable that her new boyfriend is his age but oh man is he in for a world of hurt. Especially when I eventually become his stepdad, move into that house and tell him he needs to either get a job or get out. As his stepdad I won't let him be a burden to his mother anymore and when he hears how vocal his mom is during s x he's going to want to move out anyway unless he enjoys hearing me breed his mother every night. This weekend is going to be great. I can't wait to see the look on his face."
"  parents' attempt to teach gratitude backfired when their child, shown photos of less fortunate kids, wanted the dingy stuffed monkey.","Parents, what lessons have you tried to teach your kids that completely backfired?

When my older son was about three or four years old, we realized he was starting to act very spoiled and materialistic. We always tried to make him see how lucky he already had it, but he constantly begged us for every toy, candy, and treat he saw anywhere and everywhere.
Around that time, I came across a great photo spread that involved the photographer traveling around the world and snapping photos of different children with their most prized possessions. Of course, the kids in the US, Canada, and Europe were mostly photographed in rooms filled with stuff. But there were also photos of children from impoverished nations, usually showing the child with only one old, dirty stuffed animal.
I thought I was going to accomplish this brilliant parenting move by sitting him down and going through the photos with him. I’d explain how the kids with rooms like his were beyond lucky and he should feel more than satisfied with all of the great stuff that he had. Then I would show him the other photos and he would finally understand that there are so many other children in the world with far less than he had.
We looked through the photos and talked about each one. We finally got to one with a little boy standing on his cot with his one possession, a well-loved, dingy-looking stuffed monkey. My son looked at it for a long time. I could see his wheels spinning. “Success!” I thought. After a long bit of silence, he finally looked up at me, gave me a sweet smile and said, “I want that monkey.”"
"  Spider-Man Homecoming date ends in fallout when girl wants to leave before post-credits scenes, causing regret and reflection.","What Wasnt Worth The Wait?

Last year, I went on a date with a girl. We went to see a movie. I remember it was around July, the middle of winter here in Australia. The movie was Spider-Man Homecoming, and I remember my date mostly just wanted to see Tom Holland. I was more interested in seeing where Spider-Man was after Civil War. So, we went into the theatre and watched the movie.
'Twas one helluva movie. I was enthralled the entire time, and I think that was a problem for her.
This girl literally texted me during the movie saying ""'So are you gonna make a move or what?""
And I pulled out my phone and was like ""But Spider-Man. Anyways, she was sticking out the movie as if it was a chore while I was loving every second of it. Then the credits rolled and she was instantly like ""Let's go!"" I guess this girl had never seen a Marvel movie before. She didn't seem the type. I tried to explain to her the concept of post-credits scenes, but explained she was under no obligation to stick around. She obliged and stuck around The first post-credits scene with Vulture and the guy who played Vaas in FarCry 3 happened, and she was instantly like ""Okay, now let's go!"" And I didn't know how to explain to her that there were two post-credits scenes. I tried though, to no avail. She said
""It's pretty clear where your priorities lie. Bye Ethan.""
And then she flipped me off and stormed out the theatre. Pity. She was kinda cute
Anyways, a couple more minutes of credits, and I was starting to feel bad for pissing the girl off. Would I have reacted the same if she'd taken me to see some chick flick?
Anyways, I spent the last few minutes of credits pondering whether I was an asshole or she was being irrational. And I decided it was somewhere in the middle and that I shouldn't have left her to wait for the credits scene. Then the scene came on, and it was basically one giant slap in the face to me."
"  guy's high school prank involved pretending to draw on a teacher's back, causing a hilarious and confusing situation with the principal.","What smart thing did you do in high school to piss off your teachers?

When I was in 11th grade I had a pre-cal teacher who was a little bit of a jerk. He made students come up to the white board and solve equations, and if the student got it wrong or couldn't solve it, he scolded them in front of the whole class.
So, obviously, I sat in the back of the class every time and made little noise as possible to stay out of this guy's radar. But unfortunately, on this fateful day, I was chosen to become his next victim
I walked up to the whiteboard, got handed a red marker, and was told to solve an equation he wrote on the board. I looked at the problem really hard, hoping my inner Asian power would conveniently awaken to save me from this situation, but it seemed like my American education system uprooted such powers from me. I turned around and told him that I didn't know how to solve it
Then he scoffed, as if to look down on me, and told me that we covered this area last week and that if I had paid more attention I would have been able to solve it. To be fair, we did cover it a week before but, given that I was only a teenager, I got pretty upset by the way he embarrassed me in front of the class so I decided to play little prank on him.
A put the cap back on the marker, and as he turned around from me I pretended to draw a line on his back. Then, as he faced me again, I took the cap off swiftly so it looked like I just drew a red line on his white shirt.
I said ""oops"" while trying to maintain a straight face so he wouldn't notice that it was only a prank. Then he yelled something like,
""KEI WHAT THE HELL DID YOU JUST DO!?'
Honestly I don't remember what exactly he said because I was focusing on not to laugh, but I remember how he seemed more pissed off than I anticipated and this made it even better.
I kept a straight face throughout the yelling, but when he started spinning around trying to see the mark, like a dog chasing its own tail, I completely lost it. And so did the students in the class who caught on to what I did.
The teacher did not like this
Just as I was about to come clean, he grabbed my collar and dragged me to the principal's office. There, he started explaining to the principal how I messed up his perfect white shirt and that I should get suspended for this. But no matter how loudly he tried to explain, the principal kept looking confused. Because THERE WAS NO MARK.
But. despite the principal's confusion, this guy kept insisting that I had drawn a red mark on his back. He even went as far as to say that there was something wrong with the light inside the office and that's why she couldn't see it. I
was sitting in the guest chair of the office, watching this whole thing, without being able to contain my laughter. And what made it even funnier was how students from my class, and even other classes were there, crowding the entrance to the principal's office, to watch this deranged man yell about an invisible mark on his back."

(We could be suspended or expelled.) And that we should do it on an important day. Luckily, important guests visited our school often and the next visit was the following week. It happened to be the founder of the school.
We read through the rule book for any loopholes we could've exploited. That's when I noticed that the student handbook that the wardens, teacher's, treated like a bible for ""uniform etiquette,"" said nothing of WHERE a student was to wear their ties. (Our uniforms consisted of a blouse, a navy blue skirt and a tie along with the school badge and whatever pins that aligned itself with school activities, such as house badges, student council badges etc.)
The girl decided we would use this rule to ""host a revolution that wouldn't stop until, at least, some of the 'unreasonable' restrictions were lifted."" So on the School's founder's visiting day, At least 90% of the student body started wearing their ties in ridiculous places. Like some tied it around their waist, some tied them around their heads, some tied it around their arm, some of them used them as hair ties, the list goes on. Needless to say, it made the teachers furious and embarrassed, however, the founder found the entire situation ""very funny, appreciated our respect for the school"" and praised us for our ""United front.""
The ""Red and gold rebellion"" was successful in more ways than one. (The ties were Red, gold and black.) Not only did we get our restrictions lifted, but we also became closer to the founder and were given access to speak to him if more trouble arose, the teachers grew to appreciate the many more aspects of life and the entire student body became more like a family. 
Anyway, after that, they refined their student handbook and specified where to wear your ties and more. They really disallowed rebellion through uniform loopholes after that, which I found hilarious. "
"  a daughter banned for life from store, photographed for ""Wall of Shame"" after shoplifting incident, leaving a lasting impact.","If you get kicked out of a Walmart and they say you’re banned, how likely are they to remember your face in a few months?

My daughter was “banned for life” from a store. Here’s what happened. When daughter was twelve she’d ride the city bus to school. After school, she and her best friend would walk four blocks to the bus station downtown. We told her she had to be home by five, so she often had about half an hour to walk around downtown before they had to catch the bus. It didn’t take long for us to realize that she and her best friend were shoplifting like crazy. They were picking the stores clean. So we made her assemble everything she’d stolen, and then she and I went downtown. She went to every store she’d stolen from, gave the stuff back, and apologized. Most stores didn’t know how to react. We got a lot of dumb looks from managers. “Uh, thank you,” was the only reaction from most stores. But there was a store called “Art Mart” and when we asked to see the manager, he came out and Daughter told him her story. He then, with my permission, made her go downstairs into a damp, dark basement under the store. There were leaking pipes. It looked like the kind of place you’d hold a kidnapping victim. The manager chewed her out for a while and said she was banned from the store for life, and if she ever set foot in that store again they’d call the police and have her arrested for trespassing. Then he sat her in a chair and took a photo of her. The picture went on a large corkboard with about fifty other photos, marked “WALL OF SHAME.” While the manager was chewing her out — and I wondered if he was holding back because I was there, what happened to the kids they caught in the act? — I looked at that “Wall of Shame” and realized I knew a lot of the kids. My daughter’s friends, some kids I taught in Sunday School . . . apparently a lot of middle schoolers shoplift. A lot of them shoplift at that store, too. The manager took her photo, put it on the Wall of Shame with a push pin, threatened her one last time with jail, and we left. I believe my daughter when she says she never shoplifted anything again. (She’s 40 now.) She also says she never had the slightest desire to go back to that store, either . . . not even when a friend of hers got a job there and told her she’d taken her photo down from the Wall of Shame. “Besides, you don’t look anything like when you were 12.” But why take the chance?"
"  in a desperate vigil at the ICU, mother sang lullabies to her gravely ill daughter, defying the odds and bringing hope.","What was the longest night you ever had as a parent?

When my daughter was twenty-one, she was admitted into intensive care with type 1 diabetes complications. Her cholesterol and triglycerides were so high, her blood had turned a light pink color, and her heart rate was 280-something. She was gravely ill. When I arrived at the hospital, they explained that my wonderful, beloved daughter was “in the dying process.” She “had no viable life chemistries.” The nurse took me to her room, and very kindly told me I could stay as long as I liked. She explained that my daughter's body couldn't sustain such a high heart rate and that eventually, her heart would stop, and she would die a quiet death. She looked beautiful, sleeping peacefully, but with thirteen IV bags hanging, and machines beeping. I did the only thing I could think to do. I sat down, took her hand and began to sing the lullabies she had loved as a child. Her favorite went, “sail, baby, sail, out across life's sea; only don't forget to sail back again to me.” I sang it over and over, a prayer, a mantra, an old lullaby. At some point, I noticed that her heart rate dropped a little, then a little bit more. The nurses checking on her were surprised and one said to me, “The strangest things happen in this unit. Just keep singing.” And so I did. I sang for two days and nights. I sang songs about ash groves, and three little ducks, of white buffalo and four-leaf clovers, of forlorn Swiss maids and of chiming cathedral bells. Lullabies had been a thing for us. She had loved her lullabies as a small child, and had wanted many of them each night. I had attended Girl Scout camp for two months every summer as a child, and knew hours of campfire songs that became my baby's lullabies. I remember recalling, as I sat, singing softly in the ICU, the many times I'd tip-toe toward the door to her room, sure that she was asleep, only to hear her tiny voice say, “Please sing Baby's Boats one more time.” It was a cherished memory, and one of many I was blessed to recall during that forty-eight hours. Then I felt it. Her hand moved. Then it moved again. A few more hours of lullabies and she opened her eyes. The first thing she said was a whispered, “that sounds nice.” Indeed. Her whisper is what really sounded nice. The next thing she said, as she nodded toward the foot of the bed was, “Daddy's standing there, and he's been there the whole time.” Her daddy, my husband, had died in Vietnam twenty-one years earlier when she was nine weeks old. He had told me that if “something happened” to him, he would still always be there for us. A forever twenty-year-old soldier, true to his word for his little girl - and for me. Yesterday, my daughter celebrated her forty-ninth birthday. I called with birthday wishes, and spoke with both her and my grandson. They had spend the day having a ball downhill skiing. Life is very, very good.

"  partner's absence and lies on their anniversary revealed her infidelity, shattering trust and leading to the end of their relationship.","What did your spouse do or say that made you realize they were cheating on you?

My ex fiancée used to love Ed Sheeran. We both did. His music is just incredible - he touches so many souls with his beautiful music.So, as a surprise for my ex, I had secretly brought 2 tickets to see Ed Sheeran in London UK whilst he was on tour a few years ago. I had organised travel down to London, booked a really nice hotel room for the night too. the plan was to go down to London via train, grab some nice food and then go to the Ed Sheeran concert. This was to celebrate our 6 year anniversary of being together. The day we were due to go, I'd arranged with her parents in secret to babysit our daughter, so I drove my daughter over to my ex's parents house and told my ex I had a nice surprise for her when I got back.
I got back and she'd gone, with a note saying she'd been called into work at short notice. She apologized and said she couldn't wait for the surprise later that day. This was a disaster as she hadn't been scheduled to work, and I'd spent literally about a thousand pounds on the total trip, this included train tickets, hotel booking, money for a nice meal out at a nice restaurant, plus the cost of the concert tickets which were several hundred on their own each. What she didn't realize is that I knew full well she wasn't at work because her best friend was in on the secret - she worked with my ex and had spoken to their HR department and booked 2 days off for my ex fiancée in secret to help me out. She confirmed via text a few days prior that they'd had that weeks rota and she was definitely off work so the plan was a go. I called her best friend and explained the situation, she was shocked and said there was no way she could be in work as she was currently there herself and my ex wasn't in. I immediately felt betrayed and knew immediately something was off. drove by her work, her car wasn't there. I drove to her family's houses and drove past causally. her car was nowhere to be found. I drove past a few of her friends places, and again, no car. I got home and sat and waited up until 10pm that night before she came back. I asked her where she'd been. she just point blank looked me in the eye and said
""work where else"" . 
she asked what the surprise was, I just said forget it, I just got up and went to my best mates house and just cried.
Later on she denied anything happened but it came out she'd been having an affair for 2 years with a colleague. I had no idea. I've been single ever since and she literally broke me and destroyed me and our family in every way possible. It makes it worse when kids are involved because it breaks your heart when your young daughter asks why daddy isn't coming home. I've never been the same since. I suffer with multiple mental health issues now due to it, i have extremely low self esteem and confidence due to the whole situation and my moods became very low like all the time. It's horrible. I wouldn't wish it upon anyone. Some of the stories on here really hit home how devastating the consequences of cheating are. She had always been so careful and at the time I saw no prior signs of her cheating. Now I look back there were clear signs, but sometimes you overlook things like how late someone gets home, or who they're out with; because I trusted she was not going to cheat on me. I guess ultimately she tripped herself up as all cheaters do eventually"
"  a outcast boy in middle school gives necklace, discovers fake friends, faces bullying, and tragically dies by suicide.","Students, what is the saddest event you have seen in school? 

When I was in middle school there was a kid who was really quiet. He didn't have friends since he looked weird and just didn't fit in with anybody so he just kept to himself. One day this group of scene kids were acting all friendly to him, like they were hanging out with him and everything. Then in the library, when it was this girl's birthday he came up to her with this little brown lunch bag and said ""happy birthday"" which just about shocked everyone because he never spoke to someone voluntarily; he always waited until someone would speak to him or ask him a question. She opened it and it was a silver necklace he made himself, it was really pretty. It had glass lined up almost in the swirl and the glass was cut to look like a little diamond and they were glued on a shell. She gave him a big hug and everyone saw that he turned red and looked a bit nauseous afterward. Months later they were found passing notes and hanging out more, some kids thought they were dating, everyone else knew he had a crush on her. The two looked cute together; they would eat, read, and laugh together. He was even there for her when she had guy trouble, some of the teachers called him her angel. Everything was going fine for them until he found out that she had been sharing their notes to their friends, some of which had really private things about him like how his father abused him when he was younger and how he had testicular cancer a couple years prior. Naturally he just blew up and confronted her. I have to say the look on his face will always stick with me; in the middle of their fight she just went out and said that they were never friends and that the reason why she acted like a friend was because he was ugly and felt sorry for him. He calmed down but was visually heartbroken so he just turned around and walked away. About a week later he just stopped showing up to classes, but people kept saying that they saw him eating his lunch outside at the end of the field. Well it turns out that he ended up getting in school suspension for some reason, whether it was that fight he had with that girl or if he got in a fight nobody really knows. He got back to keeping to himself, you wouldn't see him with those groups of kids anymore. Less and less people started seeing him until it was like he disappeared altogether. Turns out he has been either skipping school or being locked up alone in school suspension. The school then found out that he has been getting bullied on the bus and at home. On the bus he would be thrown around from seat to seat in the back and then would be followed home while the same dirtbags would throw rocks and erasers at him. The teachers went with the same gag of ""there's no proof of bullying"" so there was nothing anyone could do but it was apparent that the bullying was getting worse; one morning he was seen eating lunch again but he was wearing a jacket (it was late April and the temperature would peak at around 90 degrees). The teachers took him to the counsellor and they ended up finding out he had been hurting himself for the past month. Instead of getting him help they just stuck him in school suspension again, then came the rumours that he ate rats for lunch. It would all be over because he was found unalive in the in school suspension room he was locked in. The school then held an assembly to announce his passing and for some reason everyone was sad. I personally was really shocked and I honestly felt at fault for not doing anything. The group that pretended to be his friends all acted like they loved him; their sounds of crying were so fake. The girl he had a crush on acted like she lost the love of her life, how he was always there for her and ended up throwing a huge pity party for herself."

I was dating this woman named Trisha. She was my first kiss back when I was 15 and she was 14. I found her 10 years later and discovered that she still has her v card. She asked me, via Myspace, if I would take her virginity. I drove down to Georgia and she and I did the deed. In the heat of the moment she said she loved me. I just grunted. At the end of it she asked if I would be her boyfriend. I wasn't dating at the time, and the idea of teaching her the ropes was intriguing, so I said I would. Flash forward 3 months and she's breaking up with me every two weeks because everything bad in the world is my fault. I got back together with her 5 times at this point because I'm an idiot. Finally I had enough. I said that if we got back together for this last time, and if she ""broke up"" with me this last time I'm not taking her back Flash forward two weeks, she breaks up with me. She then cries to try to get me back, and I say ""no"" I go into my room and start shooting emails to people for a place to stay until I can find an apartment and I see the shadow of a knife. I dodge the knife as it comes down on the keyboard. She swung it at me a few more times, and got me once in the arm. I wrestled the knife away and held her until she calmed down. ""I'm not calling the cops. I'm leaving. Try that again and I'll get them involved and have you committed."" She runs out, grabs another knife. She attempts to take her life with it. At that point I dial 911, I meet the cops outside with my suitcase. I answer a few questions, tell them I'm not pressing charges, and then I leave for a hotel. She's still in a long term care ""mental ward"" still to this day as far as I'm aware."
"  quiet kid endured years of bullying, but after taking up boxing, he snapped and unleashed his newfound strength, silencing his tormentor.","What did the weird kid in your school do that you'll never forget?

Jon was a really goofy kid in my neighbourhood. He has no friends mainly because he was very quiet and when he did talk it was things like, ""I like stuff that smells good."" He was picked on sometimes but he had an older sister my age and we kind of looked out for him.
Even though we helped him out, he still took a lot of abuse. That is when he told his dad that he wanted to learn to box so that he wouldn't get picked on anymore. We kinda rolled our eyes at this wimpy kid doing this but whatever.
Now this was right when Rocky 1 or 2 was popular and Jon would run to get in shape for boxing. Jon ran every day, sometimes twice a day. I would estimate that he ran 2 to 5 miles each time judging by how many times he ran around our block. The thing was, he had a rather strange getup for running.
He ran with his dog. His dog was a Basset Hound. I felt so sorry for that thing trying to keep up. He didn't run with him all the time but it was quite often.
He also wore a black cap like Rocky in 90 degree weather. The best part of his getup was a rather large boombox about the size of a 30 inch flat screen television. The boombox had a rope tied to the handles at both ends so he could wear it around his neck. He would play the Rocky theme song over and over very loudly. We tried not to laugh but Jesus! I can't imagine the batteries he went through.
He continued this for about a year, and eventually dropped the cap and boombox. In fact he got in pretty good shape. He ran every day for years. He was still bullied and teased at school. He continued to box, as his sister told us but he was still shy and acted wimpy.
Fast forward to my senior year. We are in a study hall of about 100 kids. One of the older kids is behind him, smacking him in the head whenever the monitor was not paying attention. This kid was a real dirtbag and was known as somewhat of a badass.
Something in Jon snapped.
He stood up and turned around, giving him a creepy stare. The bully just laughs at him and smacks him again. The monitor is now yelling at both of them.
Jon punches him. Right in the face. The kid's nose explodes into blood, flying over anyone within a few seats of them. He smacks him again! And Again, and again!. The kid is slumped over his desk now, barely conscious. Me and my buds were cheering like we were at an Iron Mike Tyson fight. Girls are screaming. Kids are scrambling everywhere, either to get away or to get a closer view. The monitor finally makes it to the kid after about his tenth smack to this kid's face and she grabs Jon. Jon pushes her away like she was nothing and she falls to the ground.
That snapped him out of it. He turns around, back to his shy self, quietly saying ""sorry"" to the monitor, helping her up with his hands, and he starts to walk out. The whole episode lasted maybe 1 minute at most.
At some point someone went to get the principal and he met Jon at the door. Jon went willingly, along with a cheer from many of us accidental spectators.
Right behind the principal was the assistant principal and the school nurse. The monitor went to help the bully, who was out cold. He kind of came to senses when the monitor and the others got to help him.
The douche was quickly becoming aware of what had just happened to him. He was humiliated beyond belief. The nurse and assistant principal got him up and helped him walk down to the nurses station. He was mad and was yelling at them, saying, ""I'm fine, let me go!"" They allowed him to walk out on his own, where he promptly fell down the flight of steps outside of study hall. An ambulance was called and he was taken away.
Jon was sent to juvie for 3 months, suspended for the rest of the semester. The douche never messed with Jon again. In fact, no one messed with Jon again."
"  911 operator's unforgettable call: A suicidal girl gave false addresses, but eventually received help after a failed hanging attempt.","911 operators, what call will you Simply Never Forget?

The call I'll never forget is the first suicide caller I got. It was around 11:30 pm and this girl called 911. She must have been 19-20 years old. All she says is that she is just calling to let me know where to find her body. I ask her where she's at, an address, intersection, anything. She tells me she's old enough to know that I already have her location, so she doesn't need to give it to me. That's not true. All I have is the location of the cell tower her cell phone is pinging off of. No way I can find her. I plead with her a bit, and she finally gives me an address.
Then, I ask her how she's planning to do it. I'm trying to keep her on the line as long as possible so she doesn't actually hurt herself, but she doesn't answer me anymore. I decided to get the paramedics on the line so we can get police and fire rolling to her location. While I'm connecting to the fire department, I hear this crash and a choking sound. I don't know what she did, but my heart drops. I'm thinking she killed herself with me on the line. I give the address to FD and I have PD on the way. I'm listening on the radio while I'm trying to get this girl to talk to me again when I hear the officers ask to verify the address, they don't see a house there. 
I finally got this girl to come back on the phone and she's crying hysterically. I ask her what happened and she tells me she was in the bathroom and tried to hang herself. She was too heavy and the shower curtain bar bent. I'm a bit relieved because she's not dead, but she's still in danger. I asked her to give me the address again and even though she's on the same street, her address is further south. Shit! I have to get officers and EMS that are closer to go.
I started talking to her and so far so good. Officers get there, but they can't find her. I'm freaking out because I'm thinking she gave me the wrong address again. And she stops talking to me again. Just an open line. I don't know what to do. Silence. I attempted hanging up and calling her, no answer. I'm thinking I f’ed up. I ask my supervisor if there is anything else I can do, and they reassure me and tell me I did all I could. I listened to the police radio for a bit and saw that the officers managed to get into the house and found the girl and she was being transported to the hospital. It was a huge weight off my shoulders. I took a break for a few minutes to collect my thoughts and went back to answering more calls. We were busy.

","Learning my boyfriend's native Language in SECRET.

Learning my boyfriend's native Language in SECRET. I Haven't told anyone this, but I wanted to surprise my boyfriend by learning his native language. The last time I visited his home country (a year ago), I noticed that a lot of his friends and family had trouble switching to English around me, and even his sister was too self-conscious to try out her English with me. I also felt like I was missing out so much on culture and humor. I love my boyfriend and want to be an authentic part of his world. (I also am passionate about language-learning and partaking in new cultures). So I started learning his native language on Duolingo. Yes, DUOLINGO, the app with the green bird as their logo. I currently have over a 150-day streak. I'm nearly finished with this course. I've been practicing for over an hour a day every single day. In addition to this I've been watching TV and movies and listening to podcasts in the language. Luckily for me, the language isn't too different from English. I think I'm getting to be conversationally fluent, and it makes me so happy. I'm visiting his home country again in May, and I can't wait to surprise him and his family by whipping out my new secret power and finally understanding the culture and jokes better. This way they also would feel more comfortable speaking the way they usually do and don’t have to get embarrassed trying to speak English! I will update you all as soon as I am able to!"

I have an older sister, Angela, whom I have never liked. She always had to compete with me, but never in a normal sibling rivalry way. Our entire life she always seemed resentful of my existence as the spotlight couldn’t perpetually shine on her, so she had to step on everything I enjoyed. Per se, if I learned piano, she had to learn piano. If I excelled at a subject she suddenly became a scholar in it, if I told my mom I had a crush, Angela would be dating that boy in a week. I would always tell my parents when she did this but I was disregarded, because, ‘’sisters copy each other” and I can’t ‘’gate-keep what she likes.’’ She always monitored what activities I did, and the clothes I wore, so she could out-do me. If I wore a flannel, Angela would come to school wearing an all flannel dress. There was also more praise that followed Angela, even if I took the initiative to begin the activity first, she was praised because she was better. My parents would miss work to attend her dance recitals, going to every. single. one, because the world would stop if they missed it. However, I remember maybe two of mine they attended because they were ‘stuck at work’ or were otherwise preoccupied. Angela revelled in this. She would make comments under her breath around our parents. Whenever our parents weren’t around she’d tell me how much she hated me and how I should stop trying because I would always come second to her. She also bullied me in school. Angela purposely tripped me, threw things at me, and hurt me in the hallways on a nearly daily basis. The school had gotten involved multiple times, threatening Angela with suspension and my parents fought it every time. My parents repeatedly told the administration that this was a family matter and we were just bickering like normal sisters. She was never once reprimanded by either parent. I often was in trouble as Angela would start crying, saying how she was being targeted by the school when I had antagonised her. After one of these occasions Angela bruised herself to prove to Dad that I was the aggressor. I became a pariah due to Angela’s malicious rumours about me, so it was difficult for me to make friends, I resorted to only befriending people from other districts. Angela eventually made sure I had nobody by stalking them, befriending them, telling all my friends lies about how I was favoured by our parents and I constantly bullied and belittled her. She even stole boyfriends of mine doing this. Convincing them I was horribly mean and an awful person that copied her every move. Once she catfished me on Myspace for 4 months, and baited me into sending her private pictures, which she proceeded to send to my parents and everyone in school, including teachers. Later on, she told one of the boys I liked that those were actually her pictures and I had catfished her. The day of my high school graduation my Mom sat me down and told me Angela revealed the horrid abuse she’d suffered at my hand and I was no longer welcome in their home. After moving out the next day, my parents made very few attempts to communicate with me, only the occasional holiday and birthday text. All financial aid also abruptly ended as soon as I stepped foot on campus. I met my husband shortly after this, and we were married within a year. They did not feel inclined to attend my wedding or even congratulate me. I informed my parents when I had my first child 8 years ago as an opening but they have made no attempt to contact or meet any of my 3 children. Best I know of Angela now from what I’ve heard, is that she got married to one of the boyfriends she stole from me in high school and she’s been posting about her infertility issues and how she can’t offer my parents their ‘first grand baby’. After years of silence, I received a text at 8 this morning from my mother that I will copy and paste below; “Hey , it’s me your mama! We haven’t talked in a while and I surely Miss you terrible. I wanted to let you know your sister just had a miscarriage earlier this week. Angie and Justin are struggling a lot right now. Send something a little sweet her way, I’m sure she’d appreciate it. Get Back to me I love You.” I hate to say it but I’m glad she’s suffering. I’m glad she doesn’t get to be a mother. If she tormented me for years, what would she do to a child? Especially a girl? I don’t wish evil on any baby, but I know in my heart that child would be damaged by her. I’m angry at my parents expecting me to have any sense of obligation to her. I don’t even have any sense of obligation to them. They always believed her and dismissed me. I was always the problem child, and it’s strange how my mother can be so warm to me when asking me to do something for my sister. "
"  a person who falls in love with their severely autistic roommate, becomes close friends, and eventually asks them out on a date.","I’m falling in love with my severely autistic roommate. I’m falling in love with my severely autistic roommate. I have been living with my roommate for almost a year and I am so in love with her. She is severely autistic, and has trouble forming sentences but my god she is a phenomenal lover. We knew each other in high school but weren’t really friends. She stayed back home for college while I went to a school on the other side of the state, then found a job I like in the same city. She moved to my city to start a new job and I offered her my other room since I needed a roommate. Since she moved in we have become incredibly close friends. We instantly connected and started confiding in each other with our personal problems. We know almost everything about each other and we both have trust in the other person. She is so clean and organized and never makes a mess. She is really into fitness and got me into pilates. She checks in on me and even makes me dinner sometimes. She is an amazing cook and I will eat anything she makes. My favorite time with her is when we are cooking and I say something that makes her laugh. She has the nicest smile in the world and I can listen to her talk for hours. She is so beautiful. When we hang out or meet up with friends she is always the life of the party. She is just a good, honest person. I thought she was good looking in high school but being her roommate is making me fall in love with her. She isn’t doing me any favors either. I keep trying to suppress my feelings but she does something that reels me in further. She always complains about being touch starved and asks me to hold her. She loves it when I play with her hair. There has been heavy rain where I live for the past couple of months and when there is thunder and lightning she will come to my room and ask if she could stay with me until the thunder goes away. She is not afraid of thunder so I sometimes wonder if she’s doing it on purpose. Today I woke up late so I ran out the door without making my bed. When I came home from work I noticed my bed was made and my room was clean. I asked my roommate if she made my bed and she said yes and mentioned that she noticed that I have been a little on edge for the past two weeks so she made some spaghetti for me. Spaghetti is my favorite food and it might have been the reason why I started spilling my heart out to her. I did not outright say I have feelings for her but the way I was talking I might as well have told her. She understood where I am coming from and I am the only person who makes her feel safe. She then walked past me to her room and I felt her touch my hand. I think I am going to tell her how I feel. I want to be her boyfriend so bad. I can’t keep these feelings to myself any longer, I might explode. I absolutely suck at picking up signs but even I can tell she feels something towards me. I really don’t want to lose her as a friend or a roommate but I need to do this. Edit: On Monday we were watching the Warriors/Kings game. She isn’t into sports but I got her hooked on the Warriors and 49ers. She sat down on the couch next to me and rested her head on my shoulder a couple minutes later. She said she had a long day at work and she was exhausted. I placed my head on top of her head and she wrapped her arm around mine. We stayed like that until Draymond Green was ejected in the 4th quarter. After the game she said she was tired and was going to go to bed but I stopped her and said I needed to tell her something. She sat down on the couch and I told her how much I love having her as a roommate. She is a beautiful person who is making me a better person every day and I am so glad to have her in my life. I said I like her and asked her if she wanted to go on a date with me. She took a second and said yes and gave me a hug. She told me how much she enjoys being around me and how my positive attitude is rubbing off on her. She feels comfortable around me which is not something she can say about a lot of people. She knows I will not judge her for being herself but will also be upfront with her which is something she needs to keep her in check. She said she had been waiting for two months for me to ask her out and she was afraid I was never going to do it. Yesterday we went on the date and we had a great time. I took her mini golfing then we got a pizza and went back to our apartment and talked until 2AM I really, really like her. She wants to take me out on a date before we officially become boyfriend and girlfriend and I can’t wait. This is very exciting and new to me as I’ve never been with a woman as I used to fancy men. "
"  a mother discovered son's girlfriend used to be a boy, accepts it, and plans to tell husband before dinner.","How do I tell my husband about my son's new girlfriend 

I have 3 sons. All of my sons are very successful young men and are on their own. My oldest and youngest were always very outgoing and were kind of party animal's in highschool and college. My middle son focused on his grades and future from a young age. He moved out the youngest into his own home. My middle had a very bad ex girlfriend. Basically they dated since 17 and she cheated on him several times. My son never left because he loved her, but eventually he realized she was a bad woman and left her. Only took eight years. My oldest got married at 29 and my youngest is engaged. They give my middle son a lot of crap because he is single, but I always say that his ex kind of messed up his sense of love and confidence. They don't understand what he went through. My husband agrees. Six months ago he started dating this new girl that we just met yesterday. I was happy to hear that he found someone. She is very educated and smart, according to him. They have similar personalities and interests. Considering my middle is kind of a nerd, that made me very happy to hear. Anyway, I wanted to meet her immediately. My son said that she is very shy and it would take her time. Six months later she told him that she is ready to meet us. So Friday afternoon, my husband decided to grill. Everyone comes over. Then my son and his new girlfriend show up. This beautiful girl walks in holding his hand and standing behind him. He was right, she is very shy. We all introduce ourselves and we will call her Sadie. Sadie was quiet but said hi to everyone. She honestly associated the most with our dog that night. My sons go out and help their dad cook. My daughter-in-law goes out with my grandbaby, and soon to be daughter-in-law and her are best friends so they go out together. I ask if Sadie would like to help me finish the sides and chop some stuff. She says sure. I just ask how they met and typical conversations. Eventually my middle son comes in and comes up behind her pokes her booty. She gives him a ""really"" look and hits in the arm and he grabs her and picks her up as they laugh. I say put her down, don't be so rough on her. My son just says okay, puts her down and goes back out. I said, ""sorry, three boys. Sometimes they are a little too rough, but he is harmless"". She said, ""I know he is. I used to wrestle with my dad and brother growing up too"". I said, ""your mom let her daughter wrestle her older brother and dad? She said, ""well I used to be a boy so I guess it was different"" and giggled. I froze. Her face went snow white and immediate tears rolled down her face. She said, ""he didn't tell you?"". I went no. She said, I think I should leave, I am sorry. I grabbed her and said no, stay here. I said ""does my son know"". She said yes he knows. She then said, I always bring it up first date so if there are issues, we don't waste each others time. To be honest, I am very surprised, but my son has never been so happy so I dropped it. I honestly just couldn't believe it. I mean you would never know. She is gorgeous. She asked if I thought of her differently. I said that you make my son happy and as long as you treat him right I don't care. She just said thank you. I called my son today because his dad wants to get to know her more and wants to go to dinner with just them and us. He said sure. I brought up our conversation and he said he knows. He said that she is just really shy about it and doesn't talk about it at all. She just tries to run under the radar. He said that since you know we need to tell dad, but they discussed me kind of pre-telling my husband. Before tomorrow evening.

"  a parent's heart-wrenching journey as their daughter's relationship with a manipulative boy leads to depression, self-harm, and abuse.




","Parents, has anyone ever dated your child and changed them drastically?

A couple years ago my daughter started dating a boy who told her that he was adopted. Okay. Then he said he was from France and that he'd only lived in the states a couple years. I asked if he spoke another language and she said no. Warning bells. There were other little inconsistencies in the story, and I hadn't even met the boy yet.
I did eventually meet him. He was different. Just things he said, and did that didn't add up. I didn't trust him. Every time I saw him, or heard about him alarm bells went off. But it wasn't like I could tell her to stop dating him, that would just make things worse.
Then my daughter started spending most nights in her room. I rarely saw her. Rarely got her to say more than a few words. Her grades started slipping a bit as she was an honour roll student before this. Not much, but enough to notice. She became argumentative, and secretive.
Then one day my boyfriend and I went over to his house with my other two children to watch movies and hang out. The 16 year old stayed home to finish her homework. I never had a problem with any of my children being home alone before, so I was okay with it. But something she texted me during the night set off warning bells and my boyfriend cut our night short. We walked in and found them half clothed.
I called her out and took him home. First time I met his parents was me walking up to their door and saying ""Do you know where your son has been?"" He had been ignoring their calls all night and they had been about to call the police.
A week later his mom shows up to apologise. She goes through his list of lies: adoption, foreign country, refugee. All lies. Then she says that he told his mom that the night was all my daughter's idea. She begged him to come over, and she forced his clothes off. My daughter was really mad. But she loved him. So she went back to him but she could only see him at school.
Skip ahead a few months, my daughter is getting more depressed. More argumentative. She's trying anything to spend time with this boy, and I am doing all I can to discourage it, or supervise it without making it worse.
At my wits end, I snooped. I don't care what other people think about snooping, I was worried about my daughter. I was right to do so. I read through some texts and it mentioned her hurting herself. Worse, she harmed because the boy she was apparently dating decided not to speak to her at all that day. She was so depressed that she did that herself and yelled at him ""See, I love you so much I bleed for you.""
Things were messed up.
She was depressed, contemplating taking her own life, hurting herself, and I just don't know what else. I couldn't talk to her because she kept saying ""you always make it about you, I'm not you.""
But she was wrong. I'd been married to her father, an emotionally and mentally abusive man who berated me for 15 years to the point that I almost jumped off a building just to end the pain. I felt so worthless, and so useless. But I escaped. And now I was watching my little girl go through the same thing. Her father rejected her, just like my father rejected me, and this boy was giving her attention but only when it suited him, just like my husband did to me. It was the same pattern all over again.
I honestly don't remember why they finally broke up. I think he broke up with her because she wouldn't put out. The boy stalked her for a little while, but we managed to get that to end too. Then my daughter started going to a therapist. In front of the therapist I finally told my daughter what I had hidden from her and her siblings all those years: their father abused me, and I almost ended myself because of it. During therapy she finally understood what I'd been trying to tell her, that the boy was abusive and none of it was her fault.

"  individual shares a disturbing personal experience of being heavily intoxicated, consuming unknown substances, experiencing hallucinations, and enduring mental health issues.




","What is the most intoxicated you have ever been?

Before I got sober in 2016, I was an absolute train wreck. Just a garbage disposal for any and all substances. I played this game where I'd take strange pills my D J friend would give me that he got at shows, I was super into opiates and anything I could my grimy paws on. Well, I wanted to roll out by myself and play some video games at home. Sad, right? But anyway, I went down to the city to meet him and he handed me a sack of some hardcore stuff. So he hands me this baby sack and it's full of dark brown rocks. It was most certainly NOT what he said it was and I knew it. But being me, I figured I'd be fine. So I took a bunch of it. I rolled harder than I ever had in my life. I ended up leaving my buddies house and driving home. I get there and I'm still rolling hard so I take my clothes off and put on some music. After a few more hours I realise something is seriously wrong. Not only is my roll getting stronger but I'm also starting to trip. So like 5 hours after I took it I'm tripping and rolling. I'm also just absolutely crazy. I'm talking to myself, I can barely think, I am so incredibly confused, not a good time. The rest of this blends together. There is almost no concept of time and it all happened in my 2 bedroom apartment. So I began wondering my apartment, I would pass out, then wake up.  Each time I woke up, I'd have different cuts on my arm, I found a broken mirror on my door, furniture tipped over, blood on the sink and in my mouth, I lost my mind. I have no recollection of most of this so I still don't know what happened. Anyway, I laid in bed all night having panic attacks and hallucinating. Crying, trying to call my friends, and just generally trying to not be high anymore, all the while taking more. I wake up in the morning and decide that maybe if I try to take a shower and go to work, I'd ""sober up."" So I got up, got ready, took a shower and stuff, drove a couple miles to work after stopping at the gas station, got to work and started selling phones. I was there about an hour when I got to a customer who looked bizarrely familiar. He then, in the middle of us talking, turns his head to me and says, ""are you on anything?"". And at that moment, the whole store stopped and got quiet and I hyper focused on the construction work going on in the building, and then realized that our building wasn't under construction? I look around, close my eyes and open them and I am back in my bed, naked and for sure haven't left. Then cell phone customers start walking in my room asking me for help. I'm trying to explain to them that this is my house and they need to leave but I'm also realising that this is not actually happening and I have had a psychotic break. I still couldn't really control it tho. I would have quick moments of clarity, I'm talking seconds, followed by hours of horrid states of mania. So the day goes on and stuff happens the same. I did try to drive to my friend's house in the next state, I made it three miles down the road before I realised I was serving across 3 lanes of traffic and going 40. I drive back home, somehow I bought beer on the way home. Anyway I get home and it's about 7 P M and I need some grass now. I invited my buddy over and he and his girl came. She's spinning her glow hoop in my apartment and they were there for three hours. I remember, to this day, what he was wearing. I remember what we talked about, I remembered seeing him walk in my door and his voice. Remember this. Anyway after about 3 hours he leaves but for some reason she doesn't? She walked back to my room. I go back there and she's not there so I go to the bathroom and then proceed to try to sleep again. By this time I had somehow thrown all the substances away. I still didn't sleep that night but at about 4 A M I finally started to calm down and sober up. The next day I got out of bed when the sun came up and I physically had to crawl to my fridge. I laid by the fridge and drank V 8 juice and some yoghourt until it gave me strength to move. After I cleaned up, I went to that same friend's house to get some weed. I asked him why he didn't help me last night when I was clearly in distress? He says what am I talking about. I told him about last night and how he was over there. He told me that he hadn't seen me for a few days, and that's when I realized I had hallucinated them as well. Hearing that shook me to my core. For about a week after that, I had such a hard time truly believing that what I was seeing in life was real. I still have mental health issues from those days, I got lasting facial tics from whatever combination it was that I had consumed."
"  parent adopts a baby assuming he's Chinese, spends 17 years nurturing his Chinese heritage, only to discover he's Korean.




","What is the dumbest mistake you have made in your life?

About seventeen years ago my wife and I adopted a baby from an Asian American family. While we knew very little details, basically what happened with them is that we learned they were too young for children. I made very little inquiries as they seemed embarrassed and I didn’t want to pry. I was just excited to have a son and couldn’t have cared less about the parent’s history, besides their current and future well being. So as long as they were healthy and willing to gift me with their child, I really did not go too much into their histories. This was my major f up. My wife and I choose to adopt this baby because we felt for the parents and anyone that has been through the adoption process knows that it is much easier to get a non-white baby than it is to get a white one and we wanted one Now and didn’t want to be on a wait list.
Anyway we adopted this beautiful, loving, affectionate and incredible baby. It’s truly love at first sight for all of us. Around about eight months we start to feel a little bit of guilt about not raising him in his on ethnic culture and given that we live in an area with a major Chinese population, it would be very easy to introduce him to his roots. So for the next seventeen years we do everything we can to honor his ethnicity. We send him to Chinese language courses and by five he’s fluent in Mandarin and English, he gets “adopted” by a Chinese aunt and uncle (they taught him cultural things and celebrate certain holidays and take him for dim sum every couple of weeks). We’ve been taking him to China every two years since he was eight. We weren’t trying to force him to take up his culture as an “other” in our family, but we didn’t want to rob him of it or completely whitewash him either. We try and be as PC as possible and we thought we were doing the right thing.
He’s the best thing that has ever happened to me and my wife. There is not a day where I don’t just look at him and smile warmly. I love him.
Anyway we are filling out his college apps and financial aid applications and doing that whole thing. I go to my home office and go through some files and find his old adoption records. I’m not really paying much attention to them and then his biological parents' surnames pop out and basically punch me in the face. His parent’s last names were Park And Kim. For those of you that do not know, those are Korean last names. My son is not Chinese. Not even a little bit.
He’s Korean.
I suppose I just assumed it because we live in an area on the west coast where there are a lot of Chinese immigrants and Chinese Americans have been living for generations and generations. I don’t always assume every Asian is Chinese, but I did assume this for my son. Now I have a seventeen year old Korean son that thinks he’s Chinese. Now that I look at him, he looks Incredibly Korean in comparison to all of the photos of Korean men that I have just googled. Very square jaw, less hooded eyes, very broad build. None of this ever crossed my mind. I’ve dedicated nearly two decades to helping my son be close to roots that aren’t even his. I realize that I’ve just been f’ing up. I feel like a complete asshole to the tenth degree. I’m that dumb liberal white dickhead.
I have yet to disclose this to my son or wife.
I honestly don’t even know if I will.

"  intoxicated partygoers catch a burglar, tie him up like a caterpillar, hang him from a lamp post, and party ","What is the craziest thing you have done whilst intoxicated?

Here I am at my flat party, and someone threw a cigarette in my beer glass, I accidentally drink it, and I feel like I may have to barf. Both toilets are taken.
I run from one floor down, outside the building, barf my ass off in the garden on the left, and when I come around I see the neighbor's window open. My neighbor who I know is at my party, and is living alone. And someone has opened his window and entered. I go near the window carefully and see some bloke with a travel bag picking off valuables, a Dreamcast, some electrical stuff. I run back to my flat party and tell everyone there's a burglar at the next house. People call the police, but by then the intoxicated mob rule mentality is taking over. People pick up broom handles, another bloke picks up some heavy duty duct tape and some giant ass trash bags.
They all run across to the burgled house next door.
The burglar sees them, panics and tries to leave through the same window, but a couple of drunks intercept him and fall on him. The rest arrive, the guy with the broom handle hits him once or twice but not seriously, I doubt he even bruised him, but the point is the burglar's busted. He's so terrified of this mob he doesn't even try to escape, he just lies down on the grass petrified.
Then the duct tape guy arrives. After some struggle we finally manage to tie his legs together, then his hands, then his arms, and in a fit of stupor we get to fit the big ass trash bags around him and we wrap him up like a Christmas present, the only thing out of the pack of bags being his head. He looks like a huge ass cartoon caterpillar. Then we tie him up even more, with everything we got. Someone even brought scotch tape and wrapped it around him just for kicks. The dude, being pretty tall but thin and untrained as hell, is just sitting there, mumbling in shock to be let go and that he won't come back again.
We all start cheering up again when another guy has the fantastic notion to go to the all-nighter supermarket and buy a pack of rubber bands to wrap around cater burglar, and we wait for him for about ten minutes, starting to sober up.
The police are still nowhere in sight.
The guy who went to the supermarket returns not with rubber bands but with some pretty heavy rope.
Here is where I go up to my room to see if everything was all right, and when I return I see the rest of the party people having tied and raising the burglar upside down by his feet on a lamp post like a pinata.
We kept him hanging there for about twenty minutes before the police arrived. By the time they arrived we had turned the speakers towards the street and were partying around the human caterpillar. I think somebody offered the dude some beer, but he couldn't drink it upside down.
They asked us to turn the music down, which we did after a minute or two. There wasn't a problem with the noise because the neighbors were glad we caught a burglar and besides the street dancing and laughing we were quite peaceful. I remember one old neighbor opening her window to tell us to keep the noise down, but as soon as she saw what was going on outside and we explained who the human caterpillar was, she burst into a fit of laughter and went back inside.
I remember all the cops leaving with big ass smiles all over their faces, we all knew they were desperately trying to appear serious so we cut them some slack and provided them with all the info we could as soon as possible. Of course they politely refused our offers of beer, but since everyone was over 18 we didn't do anything to warrant anything other than harsh finger pointing, vigilantism is a dangerous and unlawful game etc. One guy said, ""then it's good I didn't dress as Batman like I planned,"" and we just about all died on the spot.
They approached the burglar smiling at the spectacle, asked the guys to get him down from the lamp post, this huge Greek called Peter took him on his shoulder like you'd carry a rolled up carpet and carefully placed him inside the police car. They left with the guy still in caterburglar costume.

"  popular student's life crumbles when a bomb threat leads to a lockdown, arrest, and revelation of revenge plot.




","How did the popular kid’s life fall apart in a few seconds?

So I went to high school in a somewhat rural area in Alabama, during my junior year the counties district attorney was coming to give a speech about drunk driving or something like that (it's been a few years so I dont exactly remember). Well an hour before the assembly everyone was called to the gym and told not to being anything with us. We get there and their are dogs and officers searching students. Everyone was freaked up but we had assumed they moved the assembly from the auditorium to the gym and wanted to be careful because the speaker was a high public figure in the area.
After he spoke the principle told us we couldn't leave the gym and everyone was confused but didnt look too much into it. After an hour or so lunch had came and went and people started getting roudy so the principle told us we were going to be escorted to the elementary, intermediate, and middle school for lunch. This is when we started to panic and ask what was going on but no one would answer. Grade by grade we were escorted by at least a dozen officers across the school lots to each other school (all 4 schools were on the same property) given 20 mins to eat then promptly escorted back.
Another few hours had gone by and everyone was on edge but still no one would tell us what was going on. The principal had asked to see a handful of students then left us there again. We couldn't do anything but sit there, we couldn't leave the bleachers, if we had to use the bathroom we were escorted by an officer, we couldn't leave for the day, and no one was allowed on the property so we couldn't even leave with out parents.
Well it was time for school to be over and they still wouldn't let us leave, at this point students were mad and upset. People had jobs to get to and siblings to pick up. A few students tried to leave but was immediately returned to the bleachers. One guy had to be escorted out and arrested because he tired to fight an officer for not letting him leave.
Finally after seeing the students get riled up the principal told us what was going on. A student had left a bomb threat in the girls bathroom and there was a swat team and bomb squad searching every inch of the school building and we couldn't leave until it had been cleared and they found out who did it.
This sent the whole gym completely silent and everyone sat that way for a few moments. We were all terrified and just looking around. After about another hour the principal called a student down and took her out side where she was arrested. It was one of the ""popular"" girls and everyone was shocked. But they let us go home so we knew it was her.
The next morning we found out what happened, she had disliked the district attorney because he handled her family's case poorly. She had made a very poorly build explosive device with clay and bullets and hid it in her pack back and was going to set it off during the assembly. She was arrested and banned from all alabama public schools, from what I heard she is still in prison and will be for a long time."
"  former spouse's post-divorce craziness includes cheating, false paternity claims, stalking, restraining orders, and a cross-country escape.




","Divorced Redditors, what is the craziest thing your former spouse did after divorce?

While we were still married, she gets pregnant with the guy she was cheating on me with who is also married to someone else. She has this idea that he’s going to leave his wife and they’re going to get married. She got a lawyer and filed for divorce. I get a lawyer too. Only thing is that he works for his wife’s father who is setting him up to take over when Daddy retires. He realized that getting a divorce means his cushy career is over, confesses everything to his wife and begs for her forgiveness. His wife takes him back and he cuts off my wife. Seeing that her dreams of living with her bf are over, she claims that I’m the father, which is impossible because by that time, we hadn’t had s x for more than a year before conception. This does not stop her from telling everyone who will listen that it’s my kid. She has her lawyer drop the divorce proceedings. I tell my lawyer to start them with me as the plaintiff and that I want to dispute paternity. I move out. She starts stalking me. Shows up at my job and tries to get in. I work as a civilian in research and development at a military base. The security does not take any of her shit and wind up detaining her when she tries to run past the gate. She calls me at work to bail her out or something, I tell her that whatever she’s done it’s not my problem and hang up. I also was able to get a restraining order, which she violated repeatedly. She asked for everything; both cars, the entire house and contents, savings, my retirement account etc. Plus 7 years of spousal support. I offered no support and half of the assets. If she wanted to house, she’d have to buy me out and refinance in her name only. When the kid was born, she tried to put my name on the birth certificate anyway, but I’d already successfully disputed paternity, so that didn’t go over well. She had to go after lover boy, who was definitely less than happy to see her. In the end, we split the assets 50/50. Sold the house and she got no spousal support. I don’t know if she was able to get money for the kid from lover boy or not. She called me a few times after the divorce , wanting to get together and talk. The calls were in violation of the restraining order, but I never reported it. About 6 months after the divorce was final, I was offered a new job on the other side of the country. I took it and never told anyone outside of my family where I was going. Almost all of our “friends” believed her when she claimed the baby was mine and made me out to be the asshole, so I didn’t really feel the need to tell them anything."
"  a person gains ability to stop time, plans to become anarchy god by manipulating events, ruling the world, and achieving immortality.




","You gain the ability to stop time, what do you do?

I would become a f’ing anarchy god. Here's how:
Step 1: I would learn everything. Assuming internet doesn't work because the electricity is frozen with time, I would read and memorize every book. I would also document the nature and laws of time being frozen. Let's assume anything inanimate I directly touch becomes unfrozen (clothes, doors, air, etc. not people)
Step 2: Get the media after me. I would do this by auditioning for AGT. I would use my various skills to work my way up the chain until the final round (while waiting between auditions I would cause minor havok, like unexplainable things disappearing). In the final round I pretend I'm going to be performing singing. I sing horribly and midway I stop abruptly and cut the music.
""This is an act, and I am the judge."" *Lights cut and all doors lock. Security are placed elsewhere. All cameras are forced on me with a spotlight.* ""So tell me, Earth, can you win the golden buzzer?"" *I make a golden star button appear in my hand.* ""Or will you become another victim? You have one year."" *I freeze time and watch as everything unfolds on TV.*
Everyone freaks out. Some say it's the end of times, others say it's all a hoax. Regardless, I'm not a top story yet. So I wait until a prime minister gives a speech. I appear in the background behind the important figure for long enough to be noticed, but disappear before security catches me. I leave behind a golden star sticker where I was standing.
Step 3: I wait six months. Every time there are doubts, I break the left arm of someone and put a golden star sticker on it. The left arm is meant to throw people off. As time goes on towards the six month mark, the arm breakings become less frequent and people slowly calm down. But on the six month mark, I kill another higher power and leave a golden star sticker on their head.
Step 4: I wait until the day before the one year mark. Other than the occasional left-arm break, I stop all activity. The day before the one year mark I watch as people become scared. Then, at exactly 4pm, I kill all of the world leaders. Prime ministers, the pope, etc. Everyone wonders what worse I will do on the next day.
Step 5: The day of the one year mark. Countries are in defensive position. Media is in hysterics. Civilians are unable to remain calm. 4pm approaches and I hack every computer so everyone is watching me as I stand on the White House's roof and speak, holding a golden star button.
""Well, hello again, Earth! It's been a year and I have finally made my decision about your planet."" *Pause for a good ten seconds while smiling maniacally and hovering over the button. Suddenly I press it.* ""You've won a prize! Meet your new leader!""
I then disappear and the White House is covered in Golden Star stickers. I wait for another week and kill anyone who tries to enter a prime minister position.
Step 6: One week later I bring about the next major step in my plan. I collect the world's smartest people and force them to work for me. Of course, I give them astounding living conditions and make them feel more inclined to work. I have them create immortality. After I gain immortality I kill the scientists.
Step 7: Wait. I wait for everyone to mostly forget me. To the point where some are uncertain of my existence. Many years. I still make sure there's no global destruction or mass death, but overall I stay hidden.
Step 8: The reveal. I claim to be a goddess wanting to help humans. After showing people all the good I can do, I make it so they worship me. I have everyone advance space travel and invent ways for me to obtain godlike powers. I become a literal god that can create and destroy whatever whenever.
But what about when I get tired of living? What if I want to die? Eternal sleep.

","Employers and managers who had to fire their best employee, what happened?

Had a guy who would work his ass off daily inputting data into spreadsheets.. Would come in, put in solid hours of actual work, not goofing off. He would literally get 4 times as much stuff done a week as anyone else in the office. After 3 weeks straight of this, other people start to take notice and occasionally ask him to help them out when they are behind, and he obliges.
This gets worse and worse, and eventually people are basically just walking all over him while they spend all day facebooking and whatnot, because he won't say no if they ask him to help with their work. The dude just keeps trucking through though. About 4 months into working there, its gotten to the point where you can hear the extra cunty girls talking about leaving early and not getting in trouble because ""He will just do all the work for us if we ask anyway"". Well the guy goes into the bosses office, and I work right next to it so I can hear more or less the entire conversation. I am paraphrasing but it went something like this.
""I would like a raise, I am doing way to much work for how much I am getting paid. Everyone else who works here is so damn lazy, I even have people making jokes about how I will do their work for them and they will get paid for it.""
""Well (name) I can sympathize with you, but you have to understand, I can't just GIVE you a raise. If I give you a raise I would have to explain to everyone why you got a raise and they didn't.""

"  how koalas are frustrating due to their low intelligence, inability to adapt, poor nutrition, constant sleeping, and high rate of chlamydia.





","What is the most infuriating fact you know? 

Koalas are f’ing horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their f’ing lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like f’ing satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're f’ing terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is s xual assault. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I f’ing hate them.

"  a mullet guy's amusing courtroom defense: stole wrong dog, laughter ensued, sentenced to community service and repairs.




","Lawyers of reddit, what’s the most ridiculous argument you’ve heard in court?

Criminal lawyer here, at the start of a trial a guy with the greasiest mullet enters the room. Thin, tall, disproportionately sized limbs, tattoos all over; I swear the way he sat before the judge, the only thing that was missing was a beer in his hand and a chicken under his arm. Now, this guy chose not to have a lawyer represent him, as he's a regular and spends short periods of time in jail or doing community service pretty much every month, anyway. Real problem case; drugs, alcoholism etc., but still he comes across as a really sympathetic dude and has a really entertaining way of telling a story while keeping a straight face and not realizing how funny he is.
He knows he's getting fined and a couple of hours of cutting weeds as community service to keep our Dutch streets nice and tidy, but tries to win the sympathies of the judge to decrease his sentence. This man's dog was sent to a dog shelter when they found it malnourished a couple of weeks before when they brought him in for dealing--real sad, but also the reason he's standing trial. The guy got high as a kite and drunk as an Irishman on St. Patrick's and while completely drugged out of his mind decided to get his dog back from the shelter, because he really missed 'his girl'. The judge asks him if it's correct that he broke the lock and some of the camera equipment on site of the dog shelter and he confirms. You could really tell from his passionate account of the progression of the evening that he did all this out of pure love as his dog according to him was the only thing that pulled him through all of his rough patches with his girlfriend and his drug problem. So the judge orders camera footage to be shown to confirm that it is the suspect and he confirms. On it he is seen stumbling about and wrenching one of the dog enclosures open and hugging a German shepherd. At this point everyone is touched by seeing this guy be so emotional on the camera footage with the dog, hugging it, petting it and playing with it and you can see the judge really get into it, as well. Anyway, so this guy continues with his story and tells about how he took the dog to his car and went home never feeling happier in his life and ends his account with the driest delivery of ""needless to say I was f’ing surprised when I woke up the next day and there was a German Shepherd in my room instead of a Staffordshire terrier."" Everyone just broke out in laughter. He didn't get what was funny. Turns out the dude stole the wrong dog. Judge sentenced him to 50 hours of community service and €3000 or so repairs for the broken doors and camera equipment.

"  prioritizing open and honest communication, addressing both small and big issues, to build a strong and lasting marriage.




","What should you know before getting married?

I’m Divorced.
You should know that while you think you might be communicating well, you can always do better. What I mean by that is that relationships take rigorous honesty and compassion.
An example of many: I might sacrifice something because my significant other prefers something eles. Not communicating that you are sacrificing something to your SO is a problem. Sacrifices can turn into resentments and your partner has no idea that this is happening. If Something bothers you.. say it. Don't be desperate and let things slide all the time, you'll turn bitter eventually.
The more honest you are about how you feel about this little things. When the bigger stuff comes around you'll be strong as a relationship to be able to take it. Being Married means going through the thick and the thin. If your relationship cant take you being honest about what you and don't like. Even the smallest details. Then how can you expect dealing with serious matters.
I dont know if I'm explaining myself well. Bût i hope i can really transmit the root of what I'm trying to say. Be HONEST. DEEPLY.
Even if its dumb.
Most discussions are a result of something else that has nothing to do with whats going on. Stop the moment. Get honest. Get real.
Speak with emotions. Communicate from the heart. Resolve your issues. If you dont have this down before you are married you are going to* have to work on it constantly from now on..
My marriage crashed because of this. It didn't end because of infidelity or economics or anything other then the fact that i would say something and she would understand something else. We were two people living together who felt like we were all alone."

","What medical condition do you have that you THOUGHT was completely normal? 

Until recently reflecting on an experience from my childhood, I had never realized its magnitude.
I was six years old, and had a birthmark dead-center on my back. It had obviously been there my whole life, so I never thought anything of it. One day, at a routine checkup, the doctor noticed it was growing irregularly and needed removal. The problem was, with it right over my spinal column, full-blown surgery was needed. I remember being angry that I couldn't eat dinner the night before, and had to wake up before the sun did. We arrived and I was immediately put in a gown, and eventually, a bed. Then, our MOTHERF’ING PRIEST showed up. As a kid, this was just a visit from a friend. As an adult, OHMYGODICOULDHAVEDIED!!!!! Prayers were said, and I was wheeled to the operating room, now scared shitless, realizing it was actually going to happen. They put a mask on my face and told me they were gonna give me ""monkey juice"" and to count backwards from 100. I did as they said, and fell asleep at 93 with a giggle. I woke up paralyzed, which was the scariest part of the entire ordeal. Apparently that part of the anesthetic hadn't worn off yet. I was in the hospital for a day, being fed just the tips of Popsicles (since the sticks made me throw up) by my mom."
"  strained stepmother-stepdaughter relationship and tragic loss lead to stepmother moving out with her son, seeking distance and resolution.




","I’ve had enough of my stepdaughter so I moved back to my parents with my son.

I’m a 38 year old female and met my 44 year old husband about 4 years ago. I’m 8 weeks pregnant only husband and I know. I have an 8 year old son with my boyfriend who passed away in a car accident before my son was born. My husband has a 13 year old daughter from a previous marriage, (SD for stepdaughter) SD lives with us every other week. When we got married, ex-wife tried everything to get full custody of SD and failed, but it was made very clear to me (by SD, ex-wife and husband) that I am not her mother and am not allowed to participate in raising her. SD basically ignored me and my son on our weeks. It wasn’t perfect but it wasn’t hurting anyone directly. My son learned very early not to cross SD and kept to himself when she was around. I suspected ex-wife behind SD’s coldness towards me and thought this must be hard for SD with all these changes. I tried to befriend her over the years but she wasn’t having it.
It got worse when ex-wife re-married and got pregnant with twins, two years ago. She started ignoring SD, trying to get my husband to have her more (we happily obliged) and basically stopped being a mother to her. It didn’t help either that the new husband didn’t like SD and wasn’t shy about not wanting to raise another man’s daughter. I asked my husband if we could take SD full time and try to raise her because I saw that her mental health was deteriorating and that she needed stability. The ex wife blatantly refused this suggestion so we continued with the every other week. The twins were born about a year ago and all went down hill from there. It seemed like the worse SD had it at her mom’s, the more she hated me and my son. She would throw fits a couple of times every time she’s with us. Break our stuff. Call me a bitch if I tried to tell her off. “It’s her house because her father bought it and we’re just guests”. She would yell at my son and she even hit him a couple of times telling him to keep to his room if he didn’t like her treatment of him. When I told her not to put her hand on my son she told me “what are you going to do about it?” My son grew fearful of her and would ask me to take him to grandpa (late bf’s father) when she’s living with us.
I talked to my husband about it. I told him SD needed professional help because she’s not feeling well and she’s making us miserable when she’s around. So she started to go to therapy (6 months now). Other than that my husband didn’t know what to do either. If he tried to talk to her about being nice to us, she played innocent and told him she was playing around and hugged and kissed my son in front of him, and if he tried to be stern, she threw a tantrum and accused him of loving my son more than her.
Three months ago my son's grandpa passed away. This hit my son and me very hard. My son was inconsolable for many weeks and couldn’t really understand what it meant that he couldn’t see grandpa again. Grandpa was a carpenter (so was my late bf) so since very young age my son loved hanging with him in the garage “working”. Many time when he’s there he came home with something they made together. Butter knives, boxes , chessboards, and for my 38th birthday last summer I got a stool that my son designed himself and built with his grandpa and then painted. This was the last project they had together since grandpa passed away a few weeks later so the stool was priceless to us. We had it in the kitchen. SD made alot of negative remarks about the stool, how ugly and poorly made it was. She laughed at my son's poor taste and he was very distraught. This was the first time however that my husband got very angry at her and asked her to go to her room. She was so scared of his reaction that she went without any protest.
This Christmas, SD was supposed to be with her mother. On Christmas Eve, her mother dropped her off at our house very early in the morning. Her new husband had decided he didn’t want her to go with them to his parents house, where they usually spend Christmas. SD was on the verge of tears standing there listening to her mother making excuses to my husband and me. My husband hugged SD the whole time and I tried to fight away my tears.

"  a compassionate teacher supports grieving student, prioritizing their well-being over missed assignments, highlighting the importance of empathy in education.




","Teachers what’s the best smartass response from a student you’ve heard?

Tangentially related. Had a student that came back a couple of weeks out of class, counselor let the teachers know that his father had passed and he was having a rough time. I pulled him aside after class one day, told him not to worry about any of the work he missed, ""Focus on getting caught up in your other classes, I'll make things work out here."" (I was his 10th grade English teacher, we had already taken the End of Year Exam, as far as the State was concerned he was done, and that was good enough for me. Kid was straight A's until his dad passed.)
Cut to a few weeks later, I'm called into the counselor's office for a meeting with the student's other teachers. I double check and he's been doing great in class, and work I've assigned has been turned in on time (even though I told him he didn't have to.) So I have no idea what's going on. Come to find out his other teachers weren't as lenient on the make up work as I was. He had gotten behind in all his other classes and had stayed behind, now he was in danger of failing everything but my class, he'd have to repeat the year save for English. counselor asks me what I did to help the student.
""Oh, well I told him not to worry about anything he missed, and that as far as I was concerned he was already caught up and he could do his best in class going forward.""
One of the other teachers bawked, ""I don't see why we needed Mr. my last name's input, he just let the kid skip out on work! That's not helpful!""
I replied, ""The kids Dad just f’ing died, you really think the last six weeks worth of history matters to him in the slightest?""
The counselor smiled and pointed at me. ""I invited Mr. my last name because I knew he would say some things I'm not allowed to say."""
"  the Titanic/Olympic conspiracy claims that the ships were switched, with the Olympic sinking as part of insurance fraud plot.




","Which conspiracy theory is so believable that it might be true?

The Titanic/Olympic conspiracy.
The sister ships (and their third counterpart, the Britannic) were owned by White Star Line. The Olympic was put into service in June, 1911. She collided with another ship, the HMS Hawke, in September of 1911 and both ships were badly damaged. The accident was a financial disaster for White Star Line, as they were found to be liable for the accident and had to pay for the damages to both ships and legal fees for court cases associated with the accident. Repairs on the Olympic took nearly two months and parts intended for the Titanic, which was still being built during this time, had to be given to the Olympic instead. Only a few weeks after being returned to service, the Olympic suffered another minor incident where one of the propellers broke off and pieces intended for the Titanic were once again cannibalized.
At this point, the Olympic was looking like more and more of a money-drain for the White Star Line, though its achievement in not actually sinking despite a major accident that should have sunk it cemented the Olympic-class liner's reputation as ""unsinkable"", but I'll get back to that in a moment.
The Titanic was finally finished and ready to leave port on her maiden voyage on April 10, 1912, having been delayed while new parts were made and delivered to replace the ones needed for the Olympic, and from there we all know the story. She went first to France, and then to Ireland, and then began her trek across the Atlantic to New York, during which she struck an iceberg and after nearly two hours, sank, taking 1,500 souls with her to a cold, watery grave that would not be seen again by human eyes for nearly a hundred years.
The Olympic went on to have a 24-year career as a successful ocean liner. She served during World War 1 where she earned the nickname Old Reliable for her impenetrable hull, and then in 1919 she was re-outfitted to be a civilian passenger ship and served as an ocean liner until 1935, when she was retired from the fleet. Her ownership changed hands several times and she was eventually dismantled and sold for scrap metal.
But what if it wasn't the Titanic that sank? What if it was actually the Olympic? What if it was a ploy to remove a faulty ship that was costing them more money than she was bringing in for White Star Line and cash in on her million-pound insurance policy?
So here is the conspiracy theory. At some point after the Titanic was completed, they switched the identities of the ships. The new ""Titanic"" was actually the Olympic and the ""Olympic"" was actually the brand-spanking-new Titanic, fresh from the construction yard with zero problems and zero history. They intended for the ""Titanic"" to suffer some sort of failure that would result in the destruction of the problem ship so they could collect the insurance money. I doubt they intended to also cause the deaths of 1,500 people; the events that transpired which led to the sinking of the ""Titanic"" possibly happened purely by chance and the iceberg wasn't part of their plan (i.e., they didn't hire the captain to specifically ram the iceberg to sink the ship or anything like that). They probably had another plan involving the repairs that had already been made on the ship when it collided with the HMS Hawke.
In any case, it wasn't really the Titanic that left port on April 10, 1912 -- it was the Olympic.
After the sinking of the ""Titanic,"" White Star Line received a tidy sum of £1,000,000 in insurance money (or £89,289,575 in today's money). This, of course, ruined the insurer, Lloyd's of London. There's an additional conspiracy theory that American financier and banker J. P. Morgan was in on this whole scheme; his company, J. P. Morgan & Co., financed the International Mercantile Marine Company in the hopes of becoming rich off of sea travel, but this turned out to be a bad investment because of the unpredictable nature of sea travel and travelers themselves. J. P. Morgan or one of his associates may have schemed with White Star Line, who was a subsidiary of this IMMC, in order to bankrupt the IMMC and allow J. P. Morgan & Co. to withdraw from the IMMC without breaking a contract. I cannot provide evidence for this beyond speculation.
However, I can provide evidence that backs up my claim that the two ships were switched and it was the Olympic who sank, not the Titanic.

","What is the worst thing that has happened at a high school reunion party that you attended?

At my 10 year high school reunion, we had a decent turnout, maybe 100 people. We were at a pretty nice hotel banquet hall.
There was one guy I had known all through high school, and he was a well known stoner. I'll call him Chris for this story.
I see Chris walk in to the banquet hall, stop in his tracks, turn around in a very slow 360 degree circle, surveying the entire room. He just says, ""Whoa..."", and he looks visibly alarmed.
He stops and his eyes settle on me. I say, ""Hey, Chris! Long time no see, man!"". He kind of slides over to me and whispers in my ear, ""This is really weird... I'm pretty sure I know every single person in this room."" And that is when I realize he is wearing the same clothes as all the banquet hall workers.
OH MY GOD. CHRIS IS WORKING AS A SERVER AT HIS OWN HIGH SCHOOL REUNION, AND HE HAS NO CLUE WHAT IS HAPPENING.
I walk him out to the front lobby, and explain it's our 10 year high school reunion. He is mortified, beyond embarrassed. He was never contacted, and didn't even realize it had been 10 years since we graduated. He just knew he was working another catering gig in a neverending series of catering gigs.

"  high school drama queen fakes a meltdown during choir concert, fooling everyone into thinking there was a tragic event.




","When did the “I crave attention” kid go too far?

I knew this girl in high school who was the queen of obnoxious and attention-seeking behavior. She was constantly trying to get people’s attention, from screaming loudly in the hall to crying hard over “sad” memes at lunch. She was so annoying, but unfortunately, many people bought and fed into her histrionics. Let’s call her Cry Face.
I never really liked Cry Face, she came off as fake and kind of rude. I tried to ignore her for the most part, but the absolute turning point for me was her over the top behavior at a choir concert junior year. It was 20 minutes before the concert was set to begin, and all the kids were practicing getting on the risers (about 100 people. Suddenly, Cry Face’s mom entered the auditorium, briskly walked to the director, and whispered something in his ear. The director nodded, and called Cry Face off the riser. When Cry Face got down, the Mom whispered something to her. All the sudden, Cry Face let out a blood curdling scream and ran for the auditorium exit. She got halfway before collapsing to the ground wailing. She kept yelling, ""oh my God, OH MY GOD,"" over and over again. The mom came up behind her, pulled her up by the elbow, and rushed out.
Naturally, everyone in the choir thought something horrible had happened. Some friends had texted her, but Cry Face would only respond with cryptic messages like ""nothing will ever be the same"" and ""why couldn't it have been me."" Rumor spread that her father and little sister had burned to death in a car wreck. With a reaction like that, what else could it be? People were talking about organizing a carpool to attend the funeral and taking “friendship shifts” so someone would always be available to comfort her. I even agreed to a couple shifts. Hell, the entire choir said a group prayer for her before the concert, and this was at a public school! We were all so worried.
Now, these thoughts would have been incredibly kind…if that was what happened. But nope. Turns out Cry Face’s little sister was diagnosed with diabetes. The sister didn’t go to the hospital. She didn’t get sick and need medical attention. The family had only received the call that the scheduled medical tests came back positive for diabetes. The mom came to tell Cry Face because the family had decided to skip the choir concert so they could meet with the doctor and talk about the medical diagnosis."

I smoke pot. I love it. However, our lungs are made to take in oxygen, nitrogen and the other elements that make up our atmosphere. Nothing else. Pot is better than cigarettes in the sense that it is not drenched in however many chemicals that cigarettes are. However, smoking is smoking. Your lungs are not made to intake carbon monoxide and ash. Even THC for that matter. I know its from the earth, and thats great. So is tobacco. Smoking anything is not good for you.
Now I hear all you guys typing ""Nahh man I dab and its healthy be its just THC concentrate and there is no carbon monoxide.""You are right! But do you think putting what is essential oil so hot it vaporized; in your lungs is a good idea? It sounds like a way to cook them from the inside out.

","People who were in a coma for a long time what news really shocked you?

I was in a coma for 2.5 months following a serious car accident. When I woke up I still had a tracheotomy and couldn’t speak. I don’t remember a damn thing from the time I was in a coma but what blew my mind, is when I woke up my new boyfriend at the time was standing there with my parents and they were chatting to each other like they knew each other. I am a super private and had made every effort for them to not even know of him so I found this disturbing. I also had no recollection of the accident for months and for a week or 2 after waking up I had to be retold where I was and what had happened every time I dosed off and woke up. I had no idea where I was and I thought I was 23, not 27 for months. I also had a really hard time recognizing faces. Like I would see people I knew that I knew but I couldn’t remember why or their names or anything, they would just look familiar. One time a while (about a month) after I had woken up my parents took me in my hospital bed for a walk in the courtyard of the hospital. We passed a large mirror in the lobby and I freaked out. I saw my reflection and I knew it was me because I recognized my parents pushing the bed but I didn’t recognize my own face. There were no injuries to my face or anything I just didn’t recognize myself. It also blew my mind that I had gone into the coma in late winter and there was quite a bit of snow on the ground and when I woke up it was spring and there was no snow (I had a large window in my hospital room). The news that shocked me the most was the fact that my parents had gone in and packed up my entire apartment.

","People who don’t let their partner have friends of the same gender, why not?

My boyfriend, his girl best friend Dee, and I are studying the same degree. We started dating less than a year ago during spring break, but he and Dee have been friends since first semester. I knew her, but we weren't very close. She was one of the first to know that we were a couple and she was happy for us. I didn't think anything weird about it, until a few months ago. She calls him quite a lot. Almost three times a day. They're very brief calls and for mundane things that can be asked by text. My boyfriend doesn't hide anything from me, he always shows me that it's she who calls him and answers on loudspeaker. The first thing she does after greeting him is to ask, ""are you with her?"" and he says yes. Sometimes she calls him after 2 in the morning or when we are in the middle of intimacy, so it's annoying. What made me go from being annoyed to hating her was when we were assigned the same place for our practices. Everything was going well at first, sometimes she gave me rides in her car, offered to buy me lunch and lent me work materials. I came to consider her a friend, until some time later. When other practitioners came, she got weird. She started referring to me as ""the idiot"" instead of my first name. If someone asked about a topic, she would say, ""this idiot knows"" or ""ask this idiot about it"". I never had many female friends, so I thought she was just being funny. Then she started criticizing me. If I made a mistake, didn't do things as she recommended me to or didn't support her in something, she would scold me as if she were my boss or my mom, always in front of the rest of the practitioners. I've always had a very peculiar humor, and I cannot hide it. If I'm in a bad mood, I don't want anyone to talk to me and I tend to snap back. When it happened, she immediately got angry and complained about me with the other practitioners, saying things like, ""doesn't it bother you that this idiot is so moody?"" or ""tell this idiot to change her mood"", which made me feel down. In addition, she organized a weekly lunch outing with all the practitioners on Thursday, my only day off from the practice. I don't want to tell my boyfriend because they're very good friends, and since he's an only child he values his friendships very much. I also don't want to be the typical jealous girlfriend who forbids her boyfriend from having female friends. But I can't stand it anymore. I've come to hate my practice. I don't know why she acts like this with me. I know she doesn't want my boyfriend because she has been in a relationship for years, and I'm not a confrontational person to make her stop."

Ooh, you have furniture, Hey, you own pots and pans, Nice, Wow, your bathroom is actually pretty clean, A bed frame, whoa, Haven't seen a guy with one of those in a bit. The depths of my surprise that women could be impressed by a Mildly functional adult was amazing. many men apparently can't Feed themselves? I would occasionally make a really really easy pasta casserole. It was literally a box of penne, a jar of marinara, a jar of Alfredo, a lot of shredded cheese, and sometimes I would bulk it up with mushrooms or some chicken. This thing took 12 minutes and made itself damn near. But it would make enough that I could take it to work for 5 days. More than one girlfriend said oh, and you can cook. I would try to suggest that it didn't count as cooking and invariably they would adamantly insist that it does. Anyway that's all to say that if he can't live alone without subsisting 100% on fast food while sleeping on a mattress on the floor and having one chair parked in front of a TV in a milk crate to game on. Yeah, Immature."
"  father's selflessness reveals poverty upbringing. Waited to eat, ensuring family had enough. Even now, his generous meals reflect past deprivation.




","What's a dead giveaway that someone has come from poverty?

My dad never ate when mom and I did. He'd sit at the table with us, but he always had stomach trouble that didn't seem to clear up until we had finished our meals. Then if there was food left he'd say well, I guess I should try to eat something, If there wasn't anything left, he'd say that he just didn't feel like his stomach could handle anything. I didn't realise until I was an adult that he was waiting to be sure that my mom and I had enough to eat before feeding himself. And that he went to bed hungry on more than one occasion. It didn't occur to me what he was doing, because his mother, younger sister and younger brother confirmed that he'd done this since he was around 10. He went hungry as a kid, to make sure that they didn't. Nowadays, even the simplest meal at his house looks like a Thanksgiving feast for an army. But he always fills his plate last and never takes a second helping until everyone else has finished. "
"  girl on Minecraft server fabricates dramatic experiences, including witnessing 9/11 and finding her uncle's pelvis bone, drawing skepticism and amusement.




","What's the most obnoxious attention seeking behaviour you've witnessed? 

I remember being on some Minecraft server with some friends when I was 15, probably around 2 A M. Somehow the convo got deep and someone said something edgy like “I know true pain”. Now there’s this girl in this group who always had to be the best or whatever. She tried to convince us that, at the young age of fifteen, she was becoming a doctor and was already in University at Oxford. She also called me stupid because I was not a doctor at 15, and couldn’t learn an entire language overnight like she apparently could. I’m not joking. Once around 10 P M she said, “I think I’m gonna learn another language. Swedish seems cool”, and then claimed she was now fluent in it the next morning. Long story short, I already knew she was an attention seeker and didn’t really like her because she tried to talk over everyone. Anyway, she sees this “I know true pain” message and takes that as an invitation to do her stuff. She goes, “Oh, you think you know true pain?”and then goes on to describe in detail how her best friend had been hit by a car when they were six, and how she held her friend in her arms while waiting for help to arrive. She mentioned other random stuff, like “my mother passed from terminal illness” or whatever. that part was true, but she milked it often. Then comes the grand slam. She says, “I saw my uncle jump out of the twin towers on september 11. I climbed into the wreckage and held up his pelvis bone. My mom took a picture of it.” Now, it was at this moment that something seemed amiss. You see, I was older than her, and I even had no memory of that event. I was two years old at the time. This was the first piece of logic I pointed out against this statement. She replied with, “I have picture perfect memory”, which I’m willing to maybe believe. My next question was, “Okay, but you must understand. The planes hit the towers pretty high up. How did you, an infant, comprehend the disaster, and then not only see, but recognize your uncle out of hundreds of jumpers falling from floors that were likely 80 to 100 stories up?” She replied with something dumb, trying to move on with her sob story, but I’m on a roll. Sleep deprived me continued, “But let’s say you somehow, maybe, one in a million noticed your uncle, and specifically your uncle, falling from the top of the burning building when you were an infant. Okay, sure. Unfortunately, you then claim to have, as an infant, slipped away from your family, past the emergency services, and found your way to ground zero, where you then climbed onto the burning remains of the building and, in all 220 floors of destruction, found a pelvis bone that just so happened to belong to your uncle? More importantly, why did your mother see this and decide to take a picture?” I don’t remember much from that night, but that always stuck with me because being a fifteen year old, she annoyed me with this, and this was me basically calling her a dummy. Also it’s a fun story to share. "
"  guy unintentionally outperformed rival in various aspects, becoming the ""villain"" in their competitive relationship throughout school.




","When did you realize you were the villain in someone else’s story?When did you realize you were the villain in someone else’s story? 

There was this guy Bob. He was a really nice guy, could have been the lead in your typical teen 'coming of age' type movie. A lot of my friends were friends with him...but me and Bob, we were never friends. Because Bob hated me. He didn't hate me at first...it was just a series of unfortunate events. It started in junior high...we both went out for the cross country team. He was good, but I was better. I mean, I didn't hardly notice the guy, it wasn't like I was out to get him, but I was always just that much faster than him. Back then, it was the top seven racers from each school that got to compete in the big multischool races. I was number seven. Bob was number eight. Bob and I were about the same size. This is important because....we both also went out for the wrestling team. In each weight class only two people got to compete at the meets...there was another guy who was a good, experienced wrestler - neither of us had a chance against him....that left me and Bob fighting for that second slot. And I was a better wrestler than Bob. It wasn't that I was great or anything, I did okay - won a few more than I lost....but I was just better enough that poor Bob never beat me. It wasn't just sports though and really, I wasn't very good at sports. I was a big nerd though. And while most people don't want to be nerds, nerds don't mind being 'big' nerds. In my school, I was known as the 'computer' guy. Bob also loved computers. There was a computer club and we'd try to write crappy little programs in whatever the BASIC language was that ran on the Apple computers we had in the labs. None of us really knew anything, but I was always two steps ahead of Bob. The thing was, Bob and I were very much alike. That's why I liked him. We had very similar interests and while I'm not great at anything, I was just always slightly better at him at literally everything we ever objectively competed in. By 8th grade, he'd given me the cold shoulder - he was never mean to me, but he was always distant and just generally seemed like he didn't like me. I might not ever have put it all together though, I never thought about him and me competing with each other - until the 8th grade 'Winter Dance'. I had a crush on a girl. I was socially awkward, and I awkwardly asked her to the dance. I actually asked her if anyone had asked her yet, and she said, 'One guy, but she didn't think she wanted to say yes to him'. I asked her, and she said yes. Junior high romance...I didn't think much of it. We went to the dance, had a good time, and then 'dated' for like three weeks. As it turns out...Bob was her 'good friend' and Bob had a crush on her. Bob was the one who asked her to the dance, but she saw him as a friend. She told me that Bob basically hated me and complained about me all the time. She didn't really know who I was, until Bob started telling her how awful I was. Poor Bob. Once she said it to me, it all made sense. I'd hate being one-upped constantly by some guy who was just like me, only slightly better at stuff. Nobody would like that, and then I swoop in, 'steal' his date and then I end up dating his crush. I felt bad, but I also didn't know how to tell him I was sorry. Also, I wasn't really 'sorry' for my actions, I didn't do anything wrong. Just sorry that my existence seemed to make his life worse. I tried my best to give him space after that, but obviously, easier said than done. Our final interaction came after 8th grade - it was the summer before high school....my older sister was running in some 10k race and my Mom woke me up at 5:30am and told me I should go. I didn't train, I wasn't ready, I didn't even know it was a 10k, (our CC races in junior high were only 1.5 miles - not 6.2)...still, whatever, I agree. I go to the race and I do pretty darn well. It was the furthest I'd ever run, and my pace really dropped towards the end....but I did it. I finished. I averaged 7:01 per mile and was really proud. At the end, they had a little awards ceremony thing and I was shocked to hear my name called. The race had different age groups and I'd taken first place. In fact, there were only two people in the 'under 14' group...me and Bob. I had no idea, but here I was, taking the first place medal from poor Bob. He finished 15 seconds after me. I swear, when he looked at me on that stage, I saw absolute hate in his eyes. I felt awful. Bob and I went to different high schools and thankfully, I haven't run into him since. I stopped running, but I wrestled in high school and I always hoped that him and I would face off again and he'd beat me - and that would be his happy ending."
"  how Jack Ryan's divorce from actress Jeri Zimmermann indirectly contributed to Barack Obama winning the 2004 Illinois Senate race.




","What's the Best Example Of the Butterfly Effect?

What's the Best Example Of the Butterfly Effect? 
Ahead of the 2004 election year, the Republican Senator from Illinois, Peter Fitzgerald, lost his party's support for reelection due to a corruption scandal. The strong frontrunner to succeed him was an investment banker named Jack Ryan. He handily won the party primary heading into 2004 and was strongly positioned to win the seat back for his party. As it happens, in 1991, Jack married an aspiring actress named Jeri Zimmermann. Because of the nature of their careers, Jack was based in Illinois and Jeri in California, which meant that their marriage was strained by prolonged absences and the need to travel back and forth between the states to see one another. In 1997, Jeri got a pretty big break. She was chosen for what was meant to be a small role on the struggling show Star Trek: Voyager, as the character Seven of Nine. Well, after she joined the cast of Voyager, the ratings for the show went through the roof. Producers wanted her to stay on for a much larger role than was planned, and writers across the country were frothing at the mouth for a chance to write scripts for Jeri's character. This meant that Jeri and her husband, Jack, were forced to be apart from one another much more often. This made Jack very upset and quite jealous, and their marriage faltered even harder. The two divorced acrimoniously in 1999, and both decided that the records of the proceedings be sealed for the sake of their children. The Chicago Tribune and W L S-T V, the local A B C affiliate, thought these records ought to be released ahead of the election. And, in late March 2004, the Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Schnider agreed, ruling that select portions of the Ryans' custody records should be unsealed. In them, Jeri alleged that Jack had pressured her to perform sexual acts with him in public in sex clubs in New York City, New Orleans, and Paris. These clubs were described as ""bizarre ... with cages, whips and other apparatus hanging from the ceiling."" Ryan's campaign activity ended a week later, and under party pressure, he officially withdrew his name from the race in July 2004. The G O P then randomly chose the Maryland diplomat Alan Keyes to replace Ryan on the ticket, an unknown person to most of Illinois. He was very unpopular and derided as a carpetbagging outsider. And so, what was meant to be a competitive race to maintain a senate seat for the G O P in Illinois devolved into a total rout for the party, with a whopping 70 percent of the vote during the 2004 general election going to an obscure Democratic challenger. That challenger was named Barack Obama."

What are some of the biggest betrayals in friendship?
I met my best friend when we were teenagers, he got married at 25 and his husband became my other best friend. We saw each other through everything, losing jobs, parents, wonderfully good and bad times. Nobody could make me laugh harder, we delighted in each other’s company, taking many foreign adventures together and we looked forward to many more. We had a long-standing plan that we would all retire together somewhere hot, pooling our money to get the best place we could. His husband once loudly complained that since he was a little older than us, he would die first and we’d be having fun without him, I remember feeling a sense of foreboding when he said that & told him not to speak words that might be casting shadows in the future, I wonder now if I knew what was coming on some level. A few short years later, my best friend started to get ill. We could see that he had a strange gait when he walked, he was losing weight and suffering all manner of strange symptoms, tremors, dizzy spells, etcetera. His husband and I were frantic with worry and begged him to see a doctor. He’s a scientist, so I knew he would have a good idea of what was happening. He told me that he thought it was Parkinson’s disease and he couldn’t face going to a doctor and getting a diagnosis because his biggest fear was that it was motor neuron disease and he couldn’t even contemplate such a terrible disease. He worked away through the week and we would call each other, he’d confide about incidents where he had collapsed and ask me not to tell his husband. I’d agree because I didn’t want my husband to be as worried as I was. Then he went rapidly downhill, he could hardly walk and was covered in bruises because he was falling over all the time. He cried and told me he was sure it was motor neuron and begged me to make sure he wouldn’t suffer at the end, I looked up the cost of taking him to Dignitas in Switzerland and told him I was sure I could swing it if it came to that. Finally, the day came when he collapsed and had a seizure at work. They called an ambulance and his husband called me to let me know and said he would keep me up to date. I told him that I was actually relieved, at least we had a fair chance of finding out what we were dealing with.
I went to visit him in the hospital the next day and found him in an incredibly confused state. He thought we were still teenagers and were at work together. I was obviously really worried and asked the staff what was going on and why he was so confused. His doctor came over to give us their diagnosis."
  a mischievous burglar pranks homeowners by setting up a Christmas tree in June and later replaces it with Halloween decorations.,"You're a burglar, but instead of stealing things you do things to confuse or annoy your victims. What do you do?

If the home owner had a Christmas tree they store somewhere when it's not being used throughout the year (the fake ones, not legit trees), I'd get it out, put their decorations on and wrap it in lights. They'll then wake up in the middle of the night or the next morning to a Christmas tree, fully set up. It's June, why is the Christmas tree up? That will confuse them.
They pack it away, still confused, and don't think about it again. That is until the next night.
The next night, you get that damn tree out again, decorate it and put it somewhere else, but this time you place a single present under it. The present is to the home owner with no name saying who it was from. Inside the box is...
Absolutely nothing.
This will continue for a few nights, adding a couple more empty presents each time, further confusing and frustrating them. Until the final night.
The final night, there is but one present under the tree. The box is heavier than usual, so they don't throw it out. Aside from a brick used to give the box some weight, there is only a letter inside.
The letter reads ""Come outside, your present is waiting!""
The home owner walks outside and before there eyes is...

"  a psychologist recounts encountering a disturbed individual who trespassed into a male dormitory and exhibited erratic behavior, prompting security intervention.




","As a psychologist, who is the most disturbing individual you have ever met?
 
While in college, I did an internship at the state Pennera College. In addition to being a mental health technician at the state psych hospital, I was also a resident assistant for the college. I assisted students with housing issues, enforced code of conduct, etc. One evening, I was pulling duty in the mail dormitory when one of my friends showed up at the office store wearing nothing but a towel. We will call him Robert. Robert asked if I would come get a girl out of his room as she was refusing to leave. I advised Robert that I was not his personal bouncer and he would need to handle his romantic dalliances himself. He explained that was not the case. He did not know the person. in his room, he had left to go take a shower down the hall. communal showers in the men's dorms, and instead of having to carry the room key with him, he left a roll of toilet paper wedged in the door to keep it from closing. they locked automatically whenever shut. safety measures. When he returned, there was a girl laying on his bed with her books strewn about as if she was studying. upon seeing him enter the room, she began screaming and throwing books and pens at him and demanding he get out of her room. I knew Robert, and he was not one prone to lie or exaggerate, so I went to check. sure enough, there she was. I told her she needed to leave. she protested, stating that she was in her room. I advised that considering it was a male dormitory, I doubted her claim. I helped her pack up her stuff, walked her up to the second floor, which had the main entrance to the door, walked her outside, and sent her on her way. I advised Robert that I needed him to sign an incident report. He followed me back to the office, still wearing his towel, waited while I filled out the report, signed it, and left. He was not gone 10 minutes before returning, still in the towel. Apparently, when we walked the girl out, we forgot to close the door completely behind us, and she double backed on us. came through the back door and resumed her study position. this time, I meant I was going to be prepared. I locked every door leading in or out of the dormitory and left a sticky note on the door advising there was a security risk and not to let any unknown or unaccompanied females into the dormitory. Next, I called campus security and advised them to be waiting at the front door to escort this individual away from the building. Then Robert and I went back to his room. Once again, I helped her pack her things and escorted her out the front door. campus security had not yet arrived, so this girl tried every door like before, but all of them were locked. She then went window to window on the ground floor, knocking to see if anyone would open the door for her. Finally, campus security arrived and captured her. The girl had a valid college ID, so we looked up her residential dorm. It just so happened that she had been assigned as a roommate to a friend of mine. I called my friend to inquire about the girl. My friend said that she had only met the girl one time, and that was the first day of fall semester. the girl mumbled something, grabbed her enormous book bag, left the room, and had not been back. We were currently in November. not knowing what else to do, campus security delivered her back to her assigned dormitory. walked her to her assigned room and emphasized over and over how this was her room and she had better not be found in the men's dormitory again. the girl would argue, then become silent, argue, then become silent. I thought that would be the end of the story. uh, no. The next morning, I was awakened by the phone. it was the Dean of students asking me if I was there on duty last night. I was advised that I was. He asked if I could come to the dormitory where this girl supposedly lived right now. It was 07:30 am. I was scared to death. What the hell had happened? "

found out my wife, was having an affair. She met a guy at work and came home one day telling me she was in love with him, no longer loved me, and wanted a divorce. This was a guy she'd only known for 3 months. At the time, she and I had been together since we were in our 20s. We have 3 kids, Well, I tried to fight for my marriage and didn't want a divorce, but she simply would not stop seeing this guy. After one weekend where she disappeared from Friday afternoon to Sunday night, I ended up throwing her out of the house. She immediately moved in with this guy. The only excuse she ever gave me was, I never wanted to hurt you, but there's just something about this guy, and I deserve to be happy. That was it. That was the depth of her reasoning for throwing everything we built together away. We ended up finalizing our divorce in early 2022. Although I had very hard feelings toward her, I faked it enough to get pretty favorable divorce terms from her. It seemed she was so eager to be with her dream man that she didn't have time for a long divorce. So in the end, I got to keep my pension in the house, which I had bought from My grandmother. I did have to give her half of my 4 o one K. However, the effect on our kids was pretty devastating. All 3 of them took it very hard. My oldest son told her that if she chose this man, he'd never have a relationship with her again. As of right now, neither of our sons has a relationship with their mother. Our daughter does talk to her from time to time, but their relationship is very strained to say the least. My daughter is a very kind person and she tries, but she usually ends her conversations with her mother even more upset than when they started. About 4 months after the divorce, my ex contacted me out of the blue. She told me she had made a terrible mistake and asked if she could come home. He dream man turned out to be an alcoholic who she says is verbally abusive and wasted all of her money. I use this opportunity to tell her exactly what I thought of her as a person, a wife and a mother. I told her this was her life now and to deal with it. I told her she no longer had a home at this house and to never contact me again. Then a few things happened over the last year that have driven her to start trying to contact me again. First off, I met someone. My sister introduced me to a friend of hers who is Also divorced, and she and I hit it off. We've been seeing each other since last summer, and while we've agreed that neither of us wants to get married again, we are together. Once my ex heard about this, she once again tried to contact me, but I ignored her. My son also got married and didn't invite his mother. She again contacted me to try to get me to intervene on her behalf. I told her I would talk to him, but I never did. Secretly, I feel like she deserves all the pain she's feeling when it comes to our kids. She destroyed our family without so much as an afterthought. Too bad. So sad. Now, she recently told our daughter that she finally broke it off with a dream man because she could take his drinking and total lack of responsibility. He wasted her half of the 4 o one K that I had to give her. He also totalled her car driving drunk. This from a man in his forties. Again, she knew this guy for 3 months and torpedoed our whole family for him. On the face of it, I act like I feel sorry for her, but inside, I really delight in the fact that she's so unhappy. Call me evil or whatever, I don't care. She brought this on herself, and it serves her right. I actually had to sit there one Saturday night while she got ready for a date with this Guy and laughed on the phone with her friend about how awkward our living situation was. I lived in hell for over a year because of her. Wait until she finds out our son and his wife are going to have a baby later this year. Maybe if she had been able to keep her legs closed, she'd get to meet her grandchild. Enjoy your shitty one bedroom apartment and your broken down used car. Me and my new partner will think of you when we're on vacation in Hawaii this summer. Hawaii was the trip my ex and I always plan to take once our daughter finished college. Maybe I'll send her pictures."
"  the indicators of someone not to be messed with: quiet, high pain tolerance, cauliflower ear, smart fighters, and unpredictable individuals.","What is a dead giveaway someone is not to be f’ed with?

Spent a large chunk of my teenage years in juvenile correctional facilities and getting into stupid shit. Between age 14 to 20 I had been in more fist fights than some UFC fighters (quantity not quality). I have nerve damage in my hands and they get stiffer and clumsier as I get older, had to pick up painting miniatures to keep fine motor control. I have tattoos to cover the scars at work (IT job)
With that I have learned:
1: loud guys are soft guys. They want to be loved and accepted, but start shit out of fear they’ll be rejected or as a reaction to rejection.
2: cauliflower ear. They probably know what they’re doing. Avoid unless you’re a seasoned fighter or also know what you’re doing.
3: smart guys. They might not be the fastest or strongest, but they’ve learned the kinetics of fighting - momentum, balance, and gravity. 1 kid kept a hand towel near him at all times and used it in a fight and almost ended another kid once (caught his arm when he swung, wrapped, twisted, and flung him into a toilet and gave him a concussion).
4: guys that walked slow and never broke eye contact. They weren’t afraid of anything and more often than not had a high pain tolerance. Usually pretty quiet.
5: bulky/muscular guys aren’t always “good fighters”. But if they caught you lacking - it was lights out.
Most importantly though - I learned you don’t f with anybody. The wirey funny guy always cracking jokes could be the one take you out of your shoes. And. Some people can just snap. The guy that gets f’ed with can be the one that pops and that adrenaline rush gave the burst of strength to suplex you into a concrete bench.

  controlling behavior began with offering a cell phone plan and escalated to trapping woman inside the house with furniture.,"People who have been in abusive relationships, what was the first red flag? 

When he moved in, he offered to add me to his cell phone plan, and I declined. Then he tried to buy me a new cell phone as a gift. I told him that I liked my cell phone just fine and would select and buy my own replacement when the time came. Then I suddenly started receiving nuisance phone calls and he suggested that I change my number. I told him that I had had my number since 1997 and had no intention of changing it. One day, he came home with a new cell phone for me. I put it in a drawer and left it there. Three days later, my phone disappeared. I searched every inch of my house (the one into which he had moved) over the next 8 days, every moment I got that he wasn't there. During this time, I relied solely on the cell phone he had given me. On day 8 of my fine toothed comb, I found my phone in a box of his recently deceased father's legal papers. I kept it and hid it. Two days later, I told him that our relationship was over, and that he needed to find a place to live within 30 days. He pretended that he was going to go out and turned his truck around and blocked my car into the garage. When he came back in, I was in the bedroom, because I was watching him block my car in through the window. He closed the door and I just sat there.until I realized that he was moving furniture. When I opened the door, there was a bookshelf blocking the door jamb. At that time, I had 3 dogs and 3 cats, and the dogs were barking like mad on the other side. I would have ended them, had I knocked the shelf over. I started screaming. He started laughing. He told me he had taken back the cell phone he had provided for me. He told me I was being evil, and that he would let me out when I came to my senses. I waited until the dogs settled down, evidence that he was no longer standing at the door, and used the phone I had stolen back to call first my dad, then 911. The police didn't give him 30 days to find a new place to live. It turns out that he had moved six pieces of solid oak furniture into the small hallway from the master bedroom. The only way I would have gotten out would have been the windows."
  person overhears their sister's boyfriend engaging in intimate activities while pretending to sleep on a cramped cot. Awkwardness ensues.,"What is something interesting you've overheard while pretending to sleep? 

So my very conservative family is big on taking family vacations. My parents never liked to spend a lot of money though, so for one week during the summer, my sister and I found ourselves in a cheap, two-bedroom cottage far away from civilization. One year, my ultra conservative parents allowed my sister to bring her boyfriend to the two bedroom cottage for a few days. My parents slept in one bedroom and of course they demanded that I be a gentleman and let my sister sleep in the one remaining bedroom. Whatever. I'm pretty laid back, but the fold-out couch sagged something fierce, so when I centered myself on the bed, the sides were practically encompassing me. My conservative parents, of course, were not about to let my sister's boyfriend sleep in the bedroom with my sister. Oh no. He was fortunate enough to get a tiny, old, rusty cot which my parents set up right next to me by the fold-out couch. We had electricity, and we had running water, but that was about it. There was never that much of anything to do, but I enjoy reading, so I didn't mind family vacations. One night, I was on the fold-out couch reading a particularly good book. It was around 1:00 AM when I finally turned off the lamp and decided to get some sleep. So I turn off the lamp, put my head down on the pillow, and then a few seconds later, I hear the slider door open. Apparently, my sister and her boyfriend were outside drinking by the campfire. They were both giggling as they came into the cottage, and by their failed attempts at whispering, I could tell that they were both at least a little intoxicated. Not my business. I didn't want to make things awkward for them, so I pretended to be asleep. I had my eyes closed and was keeping my breathing even... A few seconds later, I heard them kiss goodnight and they went their separate ways. My sister went to the bedroom, and my sister's boyfriend plopped on the cot right next to where I was pretending to be asleep. So not even a minute later, I'm half drifting off to sleep and I start hearing noises in the direction of the cot. It sounded like... fapping. Very cautious fapping. I was around 18 years old at this point. I've been around the block. I know how to recognize the tell-tale sounds of fapping when I hear them. So yeah. My now brother-in-law was on the cot right next to me smacking his meat  to images of my sister. So the cot was really freaking small. I'm pretty sure my sister's boyfriend's legs were dangling off the edge of the cot, but in any case the entire cot would shift and squeak every couple of seconds that he was doing the dirty. I didn't want to make things awkward and interrupt the guy. So I made the ultimate bro sacrifice. I kept my breathing even, and let the guy finish. Looking back it was kind of funny because occasionally he would get carried away and realize that he had made too much noise. He would pause to listen and see if I had woken up, but I kept my breathing sorta heavy and even throughout the ordeal, so he eventually would get confident and keep going. Towards the end, the cot was practically like hopping up and down, and then things finally grew silent. I knew he had finished, and sure enough, a few seconds later, he made the rookie mistake of accidentally letting go of his sweat pants and I heard the classic thwap as they came back to his stomach. So yeah, I had a hard time looking my sister's boyfriend in the eye the next morning. "
"  childhood memories of poverty are overshadowed by a disappointing science camp experience: ignored, relocated, and missing out on activities.","What are you still salty about years later?

Growing up, my family was pretty poor. A few quick examples of how poor we were - a) I often went to school without paper and needed supplies (because money just wasn't there), b) my mom got super sick with some sort of flu and my sister and I dug change out of the couch, the dirty clothes basket, and other places just to buy our mom medicine, c) we often had to cut open the toothpaste tube in order to scrape out the last bit of paste. Anyhow, being poor like that as a child was challenging, but you get by. You get used to life like that when it's all you know. In fifth grade, however, an amazing opportunity came up - a five-day trip to science camp. The school held fundraisers and bake sells to help pay the way for kids like me, and I was super excited to be going. The night before leaving, my mom packed everything she could from the list provided: instead of a sleeping bag, I had an old and used comforter; instead of a travel toothbrush set, I took my own and mom packed my toothpaste into a used lip balm container that she'd sanitized; instead of pajamas, I was given an old sweatshirt that was my stepdad's and a pair of secondhand sweatpants; and so on. Literally everything I packed was used, secondhand, and worn - but I didn't care - I was so excited to be going to science camp with my class. Next day, we meet up - everyone packs their gear into the bus and I (with a rope holding my blanket in a bundle) load my stuff, clamber on to the bus, and soon we're on our way. We make it to camp, get a quick breakdown of camp rules, activities, and trips, and get assigned to our cabins. At this point, it might help to add, that my school and several others book the camp together. So, I was mixed into a cabin away from my class. No big deal to me, I was looking forward to making friends and memories. So, I drag my stuff to the cabin. First bunk I find, I claim - which is where I encountered my first problem. Just about every girl in my cabin is from the same school and they all want to bunk together. My stuff was literally dumped onto the floor when I ran to use the washroom. The cabin leader decided it was easier to just move me - so... I got moved all the way to the back of the cabin. Away from all but two other girls. Whatever, it's first night. I figure it's gonna be great that a rough start isn't anything. Anyhow, we get through the evening, we do the activities sign-ups, we eat dinner, we go to bed. Tuesday morning comes, and I'm excited! Archery and a fossil hike are what I signed up for. Well, you guessed it: I get bumped because the activities lists are too full. Ok. It's cool, I can still do something else. I manage to find a night hike activity that accepted sign ups - it's at night, so I have to mill about waiting. I go into the learning cabin, I look at their pickled specimens, I talk to the Camp Ranger, I kill time. Night comes and we finally go out on our hike... to the lake with a giant dead goldfish in it. There are loads of crawfish and we feed them ham and learn about their environment. It's not what I had hoped for, but it was cool enough. Eventually we head back to our respective cabins for bed. Tomorrow will be better, after all. Wednesday comes, and it's only the same story as Tuesday. I signed up for clay arts and a nature walk, but clay arts is too full. Fine. I take my nature walk, we find a dead rabbit, we learn about edible plants, we discuss nature. Nothing to complain about, it was really fun! Except for that evening. "
"  guy recalls a difficult rejection from a persistent girl in middle school and an uncomfortable encounter with her years later.




","What is the most brutal rejection you’ve given to someone?

In middle school, there was this morbidly obese girl that liked me and was aggressive about it. I tried to be polite about my disinterest. It wasn't just her size but her personality as well. She was crass and rude and talked about idiotic and disgusting things and just not someone I wanted to associate with. We had the same group of friends and she constantly wrote me notes and hung around my locker and tried to be everywhere I was while pawing at me and putting her arms around me and telling everyone how much she wanted to be my girlfriend. The whole time I never lost it and I just tried to be nice and keep distance between us and let my disinterest be known. It sorta became a joke amongst my friends with them always ribbing me about it. Flash forward and I move to where I go to a different local high school than most of the kids in my middle school and lost touch with many of them when this girl drives by my new place one weekend and sees me hanging out front and stops and tells me that there is a party at her house and most of my old friends are there and she was just driving to pick up a friend who ended up not being able to come. I think about it and decide I really want to see my old friends (including a couple of girls I did have crushes on) so I jump in her truck and go with her as I didn't have a car yet. When we get there no one else was there and she keeps telling me they were coming as the party is supposed to start later and I am just very early. It was mid afternoon so it was kinda believable. Her parents were gone and she kept trying to give me more and more alcohol while becoming more and more aggressive. She would sit next to me and start touching me inappropriately and I would politely move and she would then try to sit on me (dear god). No matter where I moved she was on top of me and she was a little intoxicated making her that much braver and inappropriate to where I finally asked where the restroom was and went in and locked the door and climbed out the window and walked home. As I climbed out the window she was knocking on the door asking me to hurry because she had a surprise for me. To this day I shudder to think what it was. I sprinted the first several blocks and then winded my way through odd streets afraid she would show up in her truck. I felt bad about it. For dissing someone so hard for just liking me but realized it was more than that. I didn't see her for years after that until one night I was in a club and the waitress kept bringing me drinks from someone but would not say who. Drinks with names like Sloe Comfortable Screw and organism and S x On The Beach with the waitress making a note of the name of the drink when she dropped it off. The hint was very clear albeit very forward. I scoured the place hoping to get a clue who was flirting with me to no avail. Finally after no one revealed themselves I figured it was just some shy girl being bold with her flirtations or a joke of some kind so I got ready to leave and she showed up looking and acting the same and said it was her (I have no idea where she was that I didn't see her but this was a two story club) and wanted me to go home with her to which I made excuses and left. I have never seen or heard from her since."
"  someone consumed edibles before going to the airport, leading to a high-fueled, embarrassing moment with a massive fart.","When did ""fake it until you make it"" backfire?

When I thought I was cool enough to eat edibles with no tolerance in Colorado before the airport to go back home. It hit me during the security checkpoint, the pressure behind my eyes began to build. The strange feeling of having to poop traveled from my head to my toes and at this point I knew I had taken too much. I had sunglasses on so only having to deal with security for a few moments I was able to get through this with little problems.
I had an hour and a half before my plane boarded. My brother met a girl (he also ate edibles but had a tolerance) and was walking around with her while I was too high to function. The terminal was FULL, no seats anywhere. No problem, I'll just sit awkwardly on the floor the wrong way and stare at these people. ""Sir are you ok?"" one asks. My sunglasses were on so I pretended not to hear them. ""Why are you staring at me?"" The chicken beckons. I realize my sunglasses are shading minimally so they can see my eyes, just staring into them. ""Sorry there's nowhere to sit"" I manage to say back. My anxiety at this point is through the roof so I apologize and find somewhere else to lay down in the terminal.
I find a spot near the front of the terminal near the boarding area/help desk so if I take a nap I know I'll be woken up by the line that forms/people helping me. There's maybe 50-60 people near me all in the rows of seating and I position myself legs first at them with my head on my backpack and take a nap.
I don't know how long I napped for, maybe ten to fifteen minutes. I woke up startled to an extremely loud sound. It sounded like a plane had hit the building from the vibration. Turns out, I had let out the loudest and most pungent fart I've ever had deep out of my insides. I don't move. I have my sunglasses on still and had forgotten the encounter with the chicken earlier so I act like I'm asleep.
I blasted maybe ten people directly with my fart and ALL TEN of them got up and moved immediately. The terminal is shaken up, the laughs are deep and everyone is looking at me. The cute girls I noticed on my way in are pointing and laughing at me, the airport workers left the stand and are staring at me talking into their walkie talkies laughing.
I didn't move until the plane boarded and in line everyone was still talking about it and the staff couldn't look me in the face when I had to go through the desk with my ticket."
"  a high school acquaintance rebelled against his family's diner legacy, cut ties, rebuilt his life, and found happiness elsewhere.","What, ""A child that is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth."", story do you have?

A guy I went to highschool with burned the bridge with his entire family.
We were not best friends, more of a friend of a friend type of situation, so my info is a lot of hearsay. But I do know some things for certain. He was the middle child, with an older sister and a younger brother. His parents had owned a diner and it had been in his family for a few generations. It was an unspoken rule that the kids of each generation would help out when they were little, and eventually take it over to keep it in the family. The problem was none of them wanted anything to do with it. It was the easiest way to set him off, even mentioning it would have him go from 0-100 real quick. This didn't stop either of his parents though, they would ""joke"" about how the kids didn't need to worry about college, or moving away, all of that would be ""taken care of"" when they would run the diner. The sister being the oldest, was the first really pressured into it, but he and his brother told her to get out and don't look back, and don't let guilt trip you. So she did, and  went to college on a sports scholarship and then moved a few states away. She occasionally visits but more or less left the town in her rearview mirror. Then it was his turn, but unfortunately he didn't have the money to get away, so his parents told him to go to community college and work at the diner to save money. This is where the issues started. The younger brother doesn't go to college, and decides to go couch surfing and backpacking across the country for a few years. Occasionally coming back to work for a few weeks when he needed the money, only to take off again. So my friend gets left running the place, despite swearing he never would. I'd see him around sometimes at bars, and he was a bitter shell of his former self with a bad drinking problem and a series of failed relationships. His parents didn't seem to care that their son was a depressed alcoholic, so long as their family legacy stayed the same. He confided in me how they were pushing him to get married and give them grandkids, to settle down and  let go of this silly dream of starting over when he has the dinner. Which, given how shitfaced he was in nearly every interaction I had with him, it's impressive he was able to run it. His sister and brother couldn't be bothered to come down and help, and in fact they started to agree with the parents that he should just cut his losses and make this life work for him.
One day, he drops off the face of the earth. Nobody sees or hears from him for 3 weeks. His parents say he went on a vacation, and they also hadn't heard from him. Then suddenly he's back in town, seemingly in much better spirits, looking healthier than we had seen him in years. About two months later the diner was torn down and replaced with some other business.
As it turns out, his girlfriend at the time gave him an ultimatum. Quit the drinking and go to therapy or we're done. So he does, and the therapist points out the obvious things linking his depression and says he should take a vacation and figure out what else he wants to do with his life. He went to vegas, partied for 2 weeks and admittedly thought about killing himself. After getting it out of his system, he devises a plan to sell the diner and pocket the money for himself. Everything was in his name as the owner anyway, so it was pretty easy. He took the best offer he could, and used that money to leave town. The brother and sister didn't get a dime, and the parents were already retired. He moved to the other side of the country with his now wife, and we follow each other on social media but he seems much happier. Apparently he hasn't spoken a word to his family in years, nor they to him, and does not intend to start."
"  a frugal university acquaintance: calculated beer prices, demanded pennies, ate others' food, owed money, borrowed without returning, and held grudges.","What's the cheapest/stingiest thing you've seen someone do?

A guy we were sort of friends with at university was the worst. He used to carry around a calculator and use it to calculate the difference between the cheapest beers per ml.
One time we all chipped in £3 for a shot that was £2.97 and he demanded his 3p change, which the guy who bought it had given to the bartender as a tip. We all pelted pennies at him throughout the night and he picked every single one up.
One time a bunch of us were making fajitas together and two of us didn't want to have the steak strips (which the guy insisted on getting because they were cheaper) so we bought chicken instead. This guy ate all the chicken and no steak.
One night of pre-drinking he came to the party and said he didn't have any booze. We reminded him that the supermarket next door was open for another hour and he said he'd go in a few minutes. Guess what? He waited an hour and then tried to get booze from the rest of us. I gave him one beer and then saw him drinking out of my glass when he thought I wasn't looking.
The same night as the beer incident, the queue for the bar was really long, so we gave him money to get drinks. I gave him £2 for my 2 drinks and he came back and said they were £3 so I owed him a quid. Out of spite, I said I had no change. The next morning at 9am, he turns up at my door (45 mins away from where he lived, he had no other reason to visit either) and says that he'd written in his notebook that I owed him a quid and asked me to pay up.
This guy was super broke once, so a friend gave him 10 packs of instant noodles to keep him going until he got his student loan. Fine. 2 weeks later the friend who gave him the noodles was visiting and said ""Oh, I'm skint mate, do you mind if I have those 2 packs of noodles you have left over?"". Stingy guy refused of course and had hidden them when we went back to his room later in the day.
I don't know why we hung around with this guy. To be honest I think he just turned up to things without an invite. I did get my revenge when he picked up some grass for me and I didn't give him the money. He badgered me about it every day for about 2 weeks and I told him he'd get the money when I got my copy of series 1 of The Thick of It back, which he'd borrowed and not returned 2 years before. He has barely spoke to me since."
"  woman is engaged at 18, pressured into wedding planning. Fiancé manipulates, cancels and arranges wedding without consent. Bride refuses to pay expenses.","Runaway brides of Reddit, what’s your story?

On my 18th birthday, my boyfriend proposed to me at my party, in front of all of my family and friends. I said yes mostly because I was too embarrassed to say no. We had been dating for 2 years, but I was just about to start university, I wasn't ready at all. I asked later (when we were alone) if we could have a long engagement, at least a year or two and he agreed. We told our families and friends we would be waiting to get married. Less than 3 months later his mum and my mum took me out for lunch and decided to take me to look at wedding dresses, because ""it's never too early to start planning"" When I saw a really lovely dress that was on sale, my fiance's mother insisted on buying it for me. Their family was quite wealthy and had set money aside for all of my fiance's milestones, education, first car, wedding etc. She told me they were happy to cover the major costs as they were the ones who wanted a big wedding, and joked I could pay her back for grandchildren. A few weeks later his mum introduced me to a ""friend"" who was a florist. Next thing I know I'm looking at bouquets and discussing table arrangements. Then my fiancé starts talking about venues for our wedding, saying we need to start planning so we can find the perfect place.
By this point, I'm truly panicking...I'm just a few months into university, I haven't even fully decided what I want to do with my education, now I'm choosing venues for a wedding that's supposed to be years away? A wedding that's suddenly looking like the nuptials of a minor royal. I tried talking to my fiancé, but he just wouldn't listen. We saw a venue we liked, but they had no availability for almost two years. So we booked it and I could finally breathe again...I had 2 years to get ready for my big fat crazy wedding.
Then the venue had a cancellation, less than six months away and my fiancé accepted it WITHOUT telling me. Just canceled our future date and took the one that was now available. Then he arranged the entire wedding with the help of his mum (and mine, damn her helicopter ways!) before telling me. When he told me everything was booked, I went mental. His reaction was that he'd gone with all of my choices re catering, venue, flowers etc and so I should be grateful that he'd dealt with all the stressful stuff. All I had to do was turn up.
When I explained that I didn't want to get married in six months' time and that this was the third or fourth time I'd told him I wasn't ready for marriage yet, he told me I was being childish and that the invitations were at the printer, so it was too late to ""change my mind""
I finally realized that he was manipulating me, so I gave him the engagement ring back and told him I didn't want to see him anymore.
I told my family and friends, cried a lot, changed my number because he wouldn't stop calling, etc. Two months later my mum got a call from his mother because she hadn't been able to get in touch with me to arrange dress fittings and finalize bridesmaids.
He hadn't told them we split up. My mother explained everything to his mother and figured that was that. The following week she had the audacity to present my family with a bill for half of what they had paid out for the wedding. It came to thousands of pounds. They'd booked everything, right down to the cake and the favors, without telling me and wanted me to pay!"
"  reciprocity-led actions caused love to fade. He chose to unconditionally love, reviving their marriage and bringing happiness.




","What caused you to fall out of love with your past lover? 

When I first got married, we would be passionate everywhere, if you know what I mean, bed, floor, couch, where ever. We would do things for each other. And we enjoyed each other’s company. She was from Japan I am white american. I learned to speak Japanese and we lived in Japan a few years and life was good. We had kids together, but over the years things grew cold between us. They say that people change and you grow apart. I don’t think either of us changed. I doubt that most people change. What I suspected happened was that I would base my love on how much she loved me and visa versa. If she did something nice for me, I would do something nice for her. Or if I did something nice for her, she would do something nice for me. That all sounds fine and dandy, but I think in practice, it doesn’t work. When I do something nice for her, I expect something of equal niceness in return. However, often is the case that you don’t perceive what is done in return is as valuable as what you gave him or her. So the next time you do something, you feel less inclined to do something as nice. And so the love kind of fizzles. You basically stop caring because you perceive your partner as not caring. And chances are your partner feels the same way about you. Neither person has changed. They are both the same person, but the love isn’t there anymore. They let it spiral into nothingness. That is what my wife and I did. After 20 some odd years of marriage, there was nothing. I really had no desire to do anything for my wife, because she wasn’t going to do anything for me. We didn’t hate each other. We helped each other when needed, but that is about all. I was unhappy with the marriage. I either wanted out or I wanted it fixed. But after 20 years of marriage, I knew that she wasn’t going to try and fix the marriage. I knew that she thought I would not change so why should she have to do anything special and if I did change, it would only be temporary and things would go back to how they were, so why even try. I knew this would be her mind set. So I had 3 options. Divorce, stay in the lifeless, sexless marriage, or take a chance and do something about it. I thought perhaps divorce would be the better way. Start anew. She had given up on me and didn’t care. But I decided to give it a try anyway. I completely revamped my approach. I decided that I would try for one year to fix this. I would not require her to do anything. I would just do these things on my own. If these things wooed her back then she would be back on her own terms and not mine. So I did the following. I committed to get into shape… better diet, exercise I committed to do something special for her everyday regardless of whether we were getting along or not. I committed to do at least an additional 30 minutes of house work every day. I committed to pay her a sincere compliment at least once per day. I committed not to fight with her and to only have calm arguments with her. I decided to fix her dinner and breakfast as often as possible. In essence I decided to love her every day. As I thought, I got essentially no response from her day after day. I mean she would sometimes say thank you, but that was about it. After about four months she started to change. I kept at it. She continued to change. Ok.. she didn’t change. She was the same person, but she saw that I was trying. She saw that she was important to me. She saw that I wasn’t giving up. She wanted to be loved. She started doing things for me again. We started talking a lot more and doing a lot more together. We started dating again and going on trips. It was almost like we were newly weds again, but with less passion, but it felt great. Sometimes I would just hold her in my arms for 30 minutes. Love can be revived. It is not easy. True love takes work. Making the decision above to love her regardless was the second best decision of my life. The first of course was to marry her. Our marriage is not perfect, but I look forward to seeing her every day. She is an awesome woman. She is basically the same person I married. We just let our love die. We were lazy lovers. She asked me one day what got into me and I talked with her about my plan. I think it was a pretty good plan and so did she. And yes, we are still married, but much more happily now. I knew our love couldn’t be one sided, but I also knew it needed to start somewhere and why not me. Ask yourself, why not you? Do you want the love back? what kind of sacrifice are you willing to make to have the love back? If I had decided that she needed to do something while I was doing something, then we would have been right back to where we started. You can’t base your actions on what the other is doing in return. You need to commit to love regardless of what is done in return. That is the sacrifice and that is where real love will begin."
"  a concerned teacher discovers a student's distressing writing and finds pills in her possession, leading to intervention and support.","As a teacher, has a student's work ever made you concerned for their safety?

A fifth grade girl wrote a “story.” It was about a girl who was very unhappy and thinking of offing herself. Then she described the girl, and the description was of herself. The fictional girl even had the same birthdate. She ended the “story” by saying that she had talked the girl into not taking her life, and that she was OK now. A few days later, while students were working on an assignment, I looked over at her desk. She had a large plastic bag and it was full of red pills with a few yellow pills. I walked over to her desk and said, “Give me that.” and she handed it to me, then went to work on her assignment. I took the bag and walked out the door leaving the students working alone. I was a little worried about leaving them unsupervised, but thought I had better take care of this bag of pills first. I took it up to the office and gave it to the principal. I told her the name of the girl from whom I had taken it, and also about the essay. Then I went back to class and tried to fake that I was having a normal day. I think I succeeded. After about an hour, the school secretary came to relieve me and asked me to go back to the office. By this time, I had printed out the girl’s “story.” I took it with me to the office. The girl’s mother had been called in. When she saw the pills and the “story,” she began to sob. We decided that we would continue with a normal school day unless something else involving the girl happened. At the end of the day, the mother came a bit before school was actually out, checked her daughter out and drove her up to the psych ward at one of our local hospitals. She had already registered her, so all she had to do was walk in the door. The girl remained on the psych ward for six weeks. During this time, she tried to slit her wrists but luckily could not find anything sharp enough to do serious damage, and also made the cuts incorrectly. After six weeks, the psychiatrists felt that she was no longer a danger to herself and released her. She would be back in class the next day. Nobody had told the other students what had happened, but somehow, they all knew. So, the principal, the counselor, the DARE officer, and I had a meeting with the class and discussed how we should welcome her back. We appealed to them to not do or say anything that might cause her stress. They were good kids. They agreed. What she had done should have made her ineligible to graduate from DARE (drug abuse resistance education), which was a big thing in fifth grade. But the DARE officer said that he did not want to lock her out because he did not want to cause any setbacks. He said that, since she had straightened herself out and was no longer a threat to herself, that he was going to let her graduate, wear the DARE shirt, and participate in the musical program. The students agreed that they wanted her to graduate with them. The next day, they welcomed her back. Some girls made a point of including her in play on the playground and also sat with her at lunch. Nobody mentioned the sewer slide attempt or the scars on her wrists. I told you they were good kids. Eight years later, I had a phone call. It was the girl. She was now a senior in a high school in another school district and was graduating. She told me she wanted to thank me for saving her life. "
"  a grocery store encounter: Declined card, struggling single mom, random act of kindness, friendship, job opportunity, and unexpected bond.




","What’s the saddest “card declined” moment you’ve seen?

It was January in Toronto. I was in the grocery store with my then four-year-old son. We were chatting, teasing each other while going through aisles with giggles and smiles. There was a young mother shopping with her little boy who was about the same age as mine. So naturally we noticed each other and made some exchanges when bumping into one another from aisle to aisle. I overheard her denying a lot of stuff that her son wanted to buy by saying, “Sorry, Mommy didn't budget for this.” Or “We don't have money for that.” The little boy wasn't asking for anything absurd. He was asking for fruits, yogurts, goldfish crackers and so on. So the boy would still put his choices in the shopping cart regardless of how much his mom said she wouldn't buy them. So we finished shopping around the same time and ended up at the same cashier, her in front of me. She started leaving out the items her son put in without permission. So the boy protested and then turned into a meltdown. The mother was tired, frustrated and clearly at the end of her rope when her debit card got declined. She started putting back more and more necessities like bread, milk, cheese and eggs. Then she apologized to the cashier after the last decline and wanted to dash out of the store due to embarrassment. But the little boy wouldn’t leave without a fight. So over the whole course of the mother trying to reason with the little boy, I pieced together the story. She is a single mom living with her handicapped mom. Her ex hasn't paid child support, and she had to pay a psychiatrist's bill — for her older son — which wasn't fully covered by insurance. She works two jobs and was in a rush to get the shopping done so she can return home, drop off the kids at the babysitter and then go to work. And they are missing the bus because the little boy cried too long. So while she was taking care of the situation, I gestured to the cashier to ring through all her items and her little boy’s, grabbed a bunch of chocolate bars and added in and paid it quickly. I then gave her a lift to her place. (Thank God I had an extra booster seat for my nephew.) We chatted along the way and got to know each other a bit more. She insisted on asking for my phone number so she could repay me. When she called me a couple of days later, I casually asked if she was up for an office job. One thing led to another. She has been working here for five years now, and she is continuing with her post-secondary diploma through my company’s education assistance program. Her mom is working for us too as a part-time office administrator. I have received the most genuine friendship from her and her family since, which I am totally grateful for and didn't expect, when I used my card five years ago. I often think back to the day we met and feel lucky that I had the opportunity to know her and have this wonderful experience!"
"  customer insists on ordering nonexistent mac and cheese at a Wendy's drive-through, causing chaos and delaying other customers.","Fast food workers, what is your “Sir, this is a Wendy’s” moment?

I once had a woman come through the drive through and try to order Macaroni and cheese. I politely informed her we did not have that. She insisted we did. I told her we definitely didnt. She got angry and yelled that yes we did. I told her ""ma'am Ive been working here 3 years. We have NEVER had macaroni and cheese. Its not something we serve. Would you like to order something else?"" Shes says ""yes you f’ing do! I can see it on the menu board! Its RIGHT there right in front of me on the menu!"" I tell her Im really not sure what shes looking at, but we dont have mac and cheese, and if it really does say mac and cheese on our menu board then that means someone vandalized it. She says no, its definitely part of the menu board and its real and we do have it, and she isnt leaving until she gets her mac and cheese.
Cue quite literally 10 minutes of this back and forth, all while she's holding up the drive through line. I finally got the manager to come over and deal with it after asking him for the 15th time because they dont pay me NEARLY enough to deal with that for that long.
The woman absolutely REFUSES to accept that we dont have mac n cheese. She also refuses to order anything else, and wont move her car until we give her the mac and cheese that we dont have. We have a line of cars wrapped around the building now and everyone is pissed. Its been half an hour and the line has not moved.
The manager tells her if she doesnt leave, he's gonna have to call the cops. She screams she cant understand why we're doing all this, and why we wont just serve her mac and cheese when she can CLEARLY see it on our menu board right in front of her so we DO have it and why are we lying to her?
My curiosity and exasperation finally got the better of me, so against my better judgement, I exit the building, walk along the outside to the drive through order screen where this woman's car is.
I tell her to please show me on the menu where it says the words ""macaroni and cheese"" anywhere.
She points and confidently says ""Right there!"" With all the conviction of someone who is absolutely sure they just proved some big dumb idiot wrong and that they will be hailed as a hero.
I look where shes pointing.
I see it.
I sigh heavily as a bit more of my soul dies.
I compose myself and say, as politely as I possibly can:
""Ma'am""
""That is a picture of the orange slices that come with the kids meal. We do not serve mac and cheese. Please drive away before the police get here.""
She looks confused, looks at the menu board again, the realization dawns on her, and she drives off without a word. I go back inside and scream in the walk-in freezer for 10 minutes."
  a woman (45F) shares her heartbreaking story of her son's betrayal and her reluctance to meet him after years.,"Parents Who’s Children Ran Away From Home, Did You Realize Your Mistakes? Did You Change?

I (45F) have a son from my previous marriage. I got pregnant way too young at the age of 20 from my high school sweetheart, David (45M). We got married at the age of 22 after we graduated college. David was rich, he didn't want me to work so I was just a housewife. My son was the apple of my eye. I gave everything to him. He was my world. He and I were really close and I never had a doubt in my mind that I would not be alone in this world as long as I have him. That is until 10 years ago, I found out that my husband was cheating on me with a young colleague of his. And what is worse my 15 year old son knew about it. He hid the affair from me. Imagine how broken I was. I was betrayed by 2 people I care most in this world. I asked him why he did that? Why he hurt me? His response was that, his dad told him not to. He bought him gifts to keep his mouth shut. And having a young step-mom made him popular amongst kids. I was totally blindsided when I learned my husband took my little boy to meet that woman. They made excuses that they went on a ski trip and they took his mistress with them. I felt like a fool at that time. In the divorce ruling, my son chose my ex over me. I was heart broken. My son didn't even want to visit me after it was all done. I even tried to reach out to him once he turned 18. But he just refused. At that point I gave up and went on with my life. I would still get sad over the years wondering how he was doing. I did move on and met someone who is a single father of 2 girls. I married him and few days after our wedding I got pregnant again. The pregnancy was a nightmare. I wanted to meet my son and tell him he is going to be a brother to a baby girl. The labor was painful. I almost died on the spot after giving birth to my daughter. I still wanted to meet my son. But I knew he did not want to see me so I just gave up the idea. Over the years, the memories of him just became vague as I immersed myself into my new family. A week ago, I got a series of messages from him on my facebook. He said that he missed me a lot and wants to meet up with me. It took me by surprise. Over the last 10 years he has not contacted me now he wants to see me? Why? I have been going over every possible reason. The worst part is that I do not feel excited about it. As a mother I know I should be over the moon but I am not. My parents and husband know that. They have been pushing me to meet him. They say I need closure after all he is my son. But I don't know if I want to re-live the same trauma, So am I wrong?"
"  family shattered after a DNA test reveals the person's father is actually their uncle, leading to intense confrontations and chaos.","I Destroyed My Entire Family For Only $99!

We've all been seeing the recent craze of DNA testing and whatnot, so my dad and I decided to jump in the bandwagon and we bought 2 from 23andme. We got our results back a few days ago and I went into the DNA relatives section to check out my matches. At the top it listed my dad as only sharing 29.2% DNA with me and being predicted to be a half-brother, which is impossible. This didn't make sense to me since we also shared a paternal haplogroup and we just look so alike, so he was definitely my father. My cousin also had taken the test a while back and she shared 24.6% with me, also predicted to be my half-sibling. We're supposed to share around 12%, being 1st cousins.
I couldn't think of a genetic relationship that would explain what I was seeing and I had doubts in the accuracy of the percentages, so i asked for help. Basically, the shared percentages are extremely accurate and highly unlikely to be false. The only realistic explanation for what I was seeing was that my uncle, my cousin's father and my dad's brother, is my father. Reality hit me in the face like a flying bag of bricks. All the dots lined up and I felt a sense of loss. I sat in my room for an hour just in shock and then I had a feeling of anger come over me. I needed some f ing answers.
Without even thinking, I rushed out of my room and confronted my mother downstairs. My mom is a business women and is often away on business trips. She had no idea my dad and I had done one of these tests since she was away on a trip and just got back. My mother and I never had a 'traditional' relationship. She was always focused on her work and my dad ended up mostly raising me.
My irrational self didn't even sugar coat it. I asked her if she cheated on dad with Uncle David (name changed for obv reasons). I have never seen the color drain from someone's face so quickly. She looked dumbfounded and then mumbled ""What kind of question is this? Of course not."" I told her everything; the test, percentages, DNA matches, ALL OF IT!! Shit hit the fan. My mom fell to the ground crying, begging me not to tell dad.
I left her there and went back into my room. I called my cousin (now half sibling) and told her everything. She ended the call screaming. Dad (now uncle) then came home and stumbled into my room asking what's wrong with mom. I told him everything too. He didn't say anything after calming down. He left the room and I locked the door.
For the next few hours, I heard my entire family fall apart outside my door. My parents got into a heated argument and my grandparents rushed over to see what was going on. My aunt in law and David showed up shortly later and I'm pretty sure I heard my Dad and David get into some physical fight. Utter chaos.
I feel like f ing shit. I know it's not my fault but I can't help feeling that this is all because of me. If I had spent my f ing birthday money on something else, none of this would have happened, but another part of me is glad to know the truth. I'm too scared to go outside. I don't even know what the outcome was. The only noise I hear in the house now is the occasional sobbing coming from my mother, and I sure my dad is out of the house. F my life"
"  DNA test reveals person has no Eastern European ancestry, raising questions about their biological father and uncovering a family secret.","How Did Everything Go Wrong When You Took a DNA Test?

I've always been interested in doing one of those at-home kits that tell you your ethnicity estimates. My mother has, for many years, claimed that her own great-grandmother was completely Native American, and I recently learned that this is apparently something common for Southerners to claim, but that it is rarely true. I finally went ahead and bought one of the kits because there is nothing I enjoy more in life than proving my mother wrong.
Fast forward a few weeks. I get my results. I am 0% Native American, which isn't exactly shocking. The real surprise comes from the fact that I am also 0% Eastern European.
This probably wouldn't mean much for most people, but I happen to be Polish. Or at least, I thought I was. I have an unpronounceable, very Polish last name. My great-grandparents were Polish-speaking immigrants. My paternal grandfather himself spoke Polish as a child.
My first thought was that the test was a mistake. My results came over a week before the projected arrival date, and I KNEW I should be somewhere around 25% Polish/Eastern European. So maybe there had been an error somewhere at the lab. I started digging around through my DNA relative matches. I had matched with an extended cousin with my mom's maiden name, living in the state that she grew up in. So the DNA analyzed was definitely mine, and this was not a switched-tube situation.
There were only two possible explanations: either my own dad was not my biological father, or my Polish grandfather was not the biological father of my dad.
I look a lot like my father, so it seemed unlikely that we were not related. However, there was no strong family resemblance between my dad and his own father. In fact, my grandfather and many of his siblings had a (we'll call it) striking nose that my sister and I had often rejoiced in not inheriting. Also, my paternal grandparents had a disastrous marriage and bitter divorce—an affair did not seem out of the question.
My paternal grandfather died over ten years ago, but my paternal grandmother is still living and I gave her a call. It took a while for me to fully explain the DNA testing to her—she's 87, but we got there. She denied it and tried to explain the unexpected results with a long ramble about migrating European tribes before I was finally able to make her understand that I would be able to test relatives from the Polish side of the family and determine whether or not I was actually related to them. She told me that she didn't think that was a good idea, and I should think about it before contacting anyone.
I think I knew right then, but it was not until today, two days later, that she finally admitted it to my sister: my father had been lied to his entire life about his biological father.
So who is my actual paternal grandfather? TBD. My grandmother promised my sister that she will tell the two of us everything when my sister gets into town for Christmas. She requested that we not tell anyone until then"
"  pregnant woman's sister reacts negatively to pregnancy, asks for abortion or adoption. Sister becomes increasingly manipulative and invasive.","My Sister told me to give her my baby, and I thought that was the end of it.

I, 28f, am currently 19 weeks pregnant. My partner, 29M, and I are very excited, as this is our first baby and we have been trying for a few months.
We announced the pregnancy a month ago at a dinner party we hosted, and everyone seemed surprised and overjoyed. My sister, 35f, who I will call K, immediately burst into tears and asked me how I could do this to her. I stared at her, and asked “What?” She started ranting, saying that I always got everything I wanted (which is not true, I worked hard for all that I have) and that she knew I got pregnant just so I could rub her infertility in her face.
She screamed at me for 5 minutes about how I didn’t deserve to be a mother and she should be the one pregnant right now. My parents left with her soon after, and the party was basically over. I was really disturbed by my sister's reaction, because we had been pretty close before, and she had never done anything like this.
K called me the next day, apologizing for how she acted at my announcement and asked if we could meet up for coffee. I accepted. We met up and she pretended as if nothing had happened. Then she started a big speech about her infertility, how heartbreaking it is to be growing life inside of her, just to lose it, and how she had always wanted children of her own. She then proceeded to ask me if I could consider getting an abortion, to make things “fair”, or letting her adopt my baby. I stared at her and asked if she was serious. K said she was. I just dropped my part of the bill on the table and left.
L (K’s husband) texted me a rant that night about how I’d made K cry, and how all they wanted was to be parents, and that this meant so much to them, and I “owed” them for being more successful than them. My partner and I invested many years into our jobs, and we have worked very hard to earn what we earn now. I told them that my partner and I had been hoping for kids too and that I was not giving up my baby. He hung up.
She later sent me a long letter (4 pages) about how she had always wanted to be a mother, and could I consider either abortion or letting her adopt my baby, how I should care about my older sister's happiness, how she would make a better mum, how the oldest kid should have the first grandchild, and how I could always just have another baby since it was ""so easy for me to conceive"".
After that, she quieted down some, and I thought we were done with this. Except... it wasn't. She had posted MY SONOGRAM on her FB, and captioned it “L and I are expecting! We can’t wait to meet our little princess!”
I was seeing red. I texted her and demanded she take the post down. No reply. I texted L. No reply. So I called my mother and told her what happened. She was able to make K take the post down, luckily enough. K has called me petty for calling my mum and has continued to demand I give up my baby. I sent her a letter explaining that I had had enough of her nonsense, I AM keeping my baby, and that I recommend she get some help. I added that if she continues, I will not hesitate to call 999.
This weekend, however, was the absolute last straw. My mum and dad have the spare key to my house, and while she was over at their house for brunch, she took the key. While my partner and I were at work, she broke into our house and stole all the clothing, blankets, nappies, bottles, and pretty much any other item we had bought for the baby, except furniture. It was later returned after my mum found it in her car. I called 999, but they told me I couldn't do anything because I had no proof and because it was all returned.
My partner and I are moving in April, but I'm still scared my sister will find out where we live and take my child. I get that she's upset and jealous, due to her infertility, but that shouldn't mean I have to give up my baby. My parents know about this, and they have been doing their best to get her some help. She doesn't want to adopt, because she wants a child that's her own flesh and blood. I'm due in August, and the stress she's causing cannot and will not be good for me or the baby. My partner is looking into a cease-and-desist letter. Is there anything else I should do or say? I'm scared for my baby."
  half-asleep OPS officer redirects ship's course to move sunbeam off his face while eating breakfast. Laziness reaches epic levels.,"What is the laziest thing you've EVER seen?

I was once on a US military ship, having breakfast in the wardroom (officers lounge) when the Operations Officer (OPS) walks in. This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he's still half asleep, bleary eyed... basically a zombie with a bagel. He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious. My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-ass circle of light right on his barely conscious face. He's squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today. It's painful to watch.
But then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge. In his well-known I'm-still-totally-asleep voice, he says ""heeeey. It's OPS. Could you... shift our barpat... yeah, one six five. Thanks."" And puts the phone down. And then he just sits there. Squinting. Waiting.
And then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie's face and onto the wall behind him. After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I've just witnessed begins to overwhelm me. By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship's back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he's changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face. He's literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel. I am in awe.
He slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment I'm terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him, that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he's not going to wake up for another hour). But between his next bites he pauses, looks at me, and gives me the faintest, sly grin, before returning to gnaw slowly on his zombie bagel."
"  a heartwarming memory: Great gramma with dementia recognized narrator, attempted to steal a wig, and desired to start a traveling band.","What is one memory that never fails to make you smile every time you think about it?

The last time I saw my great gramma Claudine. She was 98 and had horrible dementia. She didn’t recognize my grandmother (her daughter) and it was honestly very sad. We were going to her house because my papa, her husband, died and we needed to go to his funeral. Before we left we got a car wash and one of the guys there gave us a red carnation. It was a weird promotion or something I think. But after a 10+ hour drive we made it to her house. I rushed inside and overheard my grandma begging my great grandma to remember her, because my grandma had recently been diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer (she kicked its Ass and beat it!) I gave her a second and knocked, then walked in. The very first thing my great gramma said when she saw me was “is that my beautiful MY NAME?” I nearly cried just from that. My grandma was super happy she remembered me but sad she didn’t remember her, and decided I should spend time with her alone. She went off to go get some food I think, but I don’t really know. So it was just me and my grammar. We chatted for a while and the inevitable question finally came up, “ME, who was that woman in here earlier?” “That’s your daughter, GRANDMA” “Oh really? Why does her hair look so weird?” “Oh, it’s a wig. She is bald now.” I couldn’t bring myself to tell her her daughter had cancer, even though she wouldn’t remember. She giggled a bit then attempted to pull me in, and said “I’m gonna steal her wig!” I laughed, she couldn’t walk or lift her own arms on her own, let alone snatch a wig right off of my grandmother's head. After about an hour my tummy started to grumble so I called my grandma back in and went to the kitchen for some potatoes. After maybe 5 minutes I heard my grandma scream. I was afraid my great grandma finally had died and rushed in, but it wasn’t that at all. My great grandma did it. She ripped the wig right off of my grandma’s head. She told her to come close to whisper a secret and with all her might snatched it.
She went on to live in a care home and got into many more antics, and would call once a week begging me to steal her away and start a traveling band."
  an estranged father's indifference and lack of emotional connection led to a fractured relationship with his son.,"Why don’t you talk to “that” family member anymore?

Last time I saw my dad in person was 1998.
He never wanted kids, and when my little sister was born, forced my mother to give her up for adoption. My mother went into a spiral of depression after that, and took her own life when I was still a teen. I found her body, had to deal with the cops and all that, and when my dad came home days later, he threw me out. ""You don't have your mother to protect you anymore,"" he said. I had to graduate high school homeless, crashing on friend's couches and guest rooms. My college dreams were crushed because I had to get a job to support myself, which was hard until I become a manager of a book store at age 18. That was 1987.
Since then, I saw him only a handful of times. I got married, had a child. My wife, in her vain attempt to have some kind of family, tried inviting my dad and his new wife to be part of ours, since they only lived 20 minutes away. But he only made it over a handful of times: my son saw his relatives (distant cousins) in another country more than he saw his own grandfather. My father is very rich, and I was very poor, but my dad never offered to help. Because of this, we struggled for over a decade before we got out of poverty. He never spoke to us unless my wife made contact.
Last time I saw my dad, he invited me out for my birthday in 1998, but it turns out he just wanted professional advice from my wife (she was an insurance adjuster). She was pretty insulted when she figured this out, and after that, she gave up on trying to have any kind of relationship with them. In 2000, they moved away, and said they had ""no fixed address, and planned to travel the world."" I suspect that was a ruse, because I have since discovered they bought a multi-million dollar beachfront condo that same year. While my dad has been pretty good at hiding his address, his wife has not. She's one of those ""socialite wannabes"" and while she's not really a bad person, she's not exactly ""complicated by the realities of a common man,"" if that makes sense. Imagine being born rich, under your father's shadow, and never really having to have an actual job. Then, because of my work background check needs, I had to find out about their life and the money they made, because of the whole ""possible foreign money influence"" thing. I know that they are worth several million, have a lot of real estate, classic cars, and a 57' pleasure yacht with a staff. The US government considers them safe, so I guess that's good.
In 2014, my wife of 25 years died, and that was the last time I spoke to them. I figured ""the mother to your only grandchild has died"" was a good enough reason to speak to them, and I sent them a certified letter. I got back a generic email from the wife, which can be summed up as, ""So sorry, it happens, but don't worry, you'll find someone else. Your father did."" Which may come off as callous, but I think that's really how she sees things, and thought she was being mature and professional. No offers to help or ""here's my number, call me if you need anything,"" or anything like that. Just a generic, ""our condolences for a troubled time,"" one might get from a vendor or something. She even signed it with her full name and professional credentials. No idea if my dad even knows or cares.
And that's ultimately it: he doesn't hate me. Hate is framed as the opposite of love, but really, they come from the same root. He is actually the opposite of love: indifference. He literally does not think of me or care, which is how he was about most people in his life. He sees people like appliances: you use them when you need them, otherwise you don't think about them much. I mean, do you think about your toaster until you need toast? He's like that about people. And when the toaster has problems, throw it out and get a new one.
Once in a while, I have to look them up because I have to re-up clearance or something. I last know my dad was alive and present for a voting redistricting video call for his district about a year ago. I suspect when he dies, I will not be informed, but will find out months or years after the fact."
"  married couple's troubled relationship led to emotional affair, but through open communication and forgiveness, they chose to reconcile.




","Married cheaters, how is your affair going/or how has it affected your marriage?

My husband and I were going through a rough patch, and were increasingly going out with friends in order to avoid facing our problems, or fighting. We got to where we were spending a minimal time together. He went out with his friends on a trip for the weekend, and when he returned I asked him if he was happier when he was away, as he did not text or call me the whole time he was gone.
During this period, there was a friend that I had that gave me increasing attention. I told him I was married, that nothing would happen between us unless my husband and I decided on separation. However, I did express that there were feelings there. And we began to act as though we were in the beginning stages of a relationship, often flirting, occasionally holding hands, going to him for my problems instead of my husband.
My marriage came to a head, and my husband and I had a talk about whether or not we were going to stay together. He cried, and I realized how nice it was to feel as though he cared about me, as I had felt neglected for some time. We decided we were going to spend three days together. Without fighting, and while trying to make each other as happy as possible, and if at the end of these three days, we still wanted to end it, we would.
At the end of the three days, after some intimacy was reestablished in the relationship and we were going to try and make it work, I told my friend that I could not talk to or see him again. I felt incredible guilt for the betrayal I had put into my marriage, and couldn't live with myself.
I cried myself to sleep for months every night, knowing that if I told my husband what I had done, he would leave me, and I did not want to give up on my marriage. Eventually, I realized I could not deal with the pain of the guilt, I respected him too much to keep this secret, so I told him, through tears that I had an emotional affair, and I was just so sorry. I just felt so alone.
He stopped me, before I finished telling him everything, and told me: ""I forgive you for anything you've done, and anything you could have done."""
"  Toxic family dynamics: Fiancé's entitled sister displays ungrateful behavior, criminal activities, freeloading, neglecting her child, and causing family strife.","Who is the most disgusting person you have ever met?

I’ve met so many disgusting people the whole 21 years I’ve been alive but never have I ever met someone as repulsive as my fiance’s sister.
She’s biracial (white and black) and she’s really light skinned with kinky hair and green eyes. She was raised by the white side of the family (maternal side), but she forces herself to act all “tough and gangsta”. She dates ex-convicts and my fiancé joked about her going on our town’s mugshot website to shop for her next book.
Anyway, growing up, she was the spoiled kid in the family. The fam always bought her brand new branded clothes like Nike, etc while my fiancé would get Walmart or Goodwill shit or hand me downs.
She’s got the best school supplies, the best phones, the best electronics, and even a brand new car (which her friend wrecked and they got her another one afterwards).
Fiancé didn’t get anything as good as her. He didn’t get a brand new car, he had to get a job in order to buy a used one.
She was sent to prison for armed robbery with her boyfriend. She was in prison for about a year or two. Fiancé sold his truck to help pay for her lawyer.
She came home sometime in Jan/Feb this year and was on probation. She broke up with her ex-con boyfriend and got with a 34 year old aspiring rapper/ex-con. He knocked her up within two months of being together. She didn’t get a job because she was “too pregnant” to work. She would complain so much about everything. She’s so ungrateful. One time, she said she’d rather go back to prison because “people respect her there”. The only reason why she got “respect” was because grandma and gpa would give her stuff to sell inside.
Her boyfriend would keep coming over and as the weeks go by, he’d stay a little while longer. Soon, he slowly started moving in her grandma’s house and both of them freeloaded off of the poor grandma. Grandma was about to retire because grandpa is dying from bladder cancer. A few years back, she stole $2k from her dying great grandpa. Earlier this year, she stole $200 from her grandma. Kind gma was forgiving and didn’t report her to her probation officer.
Boyfriend couldn’t keep a job. He got fired cuz he couldn’t handle getting yelled at and he threw a fit at work. He got another job but quit a few weeks later because he wasn’t getting enough hours. Car is broken so he borrows grandparent’s car.
Grandparents cosign so he could buy a car. He loses another job and effs up grandparents’ credit score because he can’t pay shit. He pees on the front yard and he probably shit there too because it smelled like shit one time. He doesn’t like going inside the house because he thinks everyone is judging him. Well duh? Isn’t it obvious? You can’t hold a job and you pee and shit on their lawn. Who wouldn’t judge?
Family buys her all these expensive baby stuff for her to use. She recently gave birth and the first thing she did after giving birth was to ask people for some money. Still doesn’t have a job and she still free loads off of her grandparents.
After she got discharged, she barely took care of her daughter. She would often just sit in the car and let it run. They ask for gas money cuz they keep running out of gas. How? They sit in that damn car all day and let it run. Who takes care of the baby? Her dying grandfather, retiring grandmother, and her mom.
She seldom pops inside and doesn’t really interact with the baby.
I remember coming over sometimes and the baby would be in the living room while she’s sitting in the car with her boyfriend.
Family grew fed up with her and called DCF while she was gone. DCF and a probation officer come by the house. Baby is home but where’s mama? She’s still on probation but she’s not home! She literally had a month left until her probation was over. She should’ve just waited till then before going out and doing shit.
She got arrested last month and stayed in jail for a couple of weeks. Police found weed ashes under the baby's car seat and the whole car reeked of weed. They couldn’t do anything else because they lack further evidence. While she was gone, boyfriend asked grandpa for $1.4k to pay for rent. Grandpa suggests coming with him so he can actually see if he really did find a place. Boyfriend says never mind.
She recently got out of jail (what the eff bro, we thought she’d be in prison for ten years but nope she got out and had to wear that ankle monitor).
Family is done with her shit and told her that they’re dead to her. They call the family to ask for money, but the family refuses. They stopped by to grab some stuff and left to sleep in some hotel. Fiancé said grandpa’s handgun is missing. Baby is still in the care of mom and grandma."
"  lifelong friendship turns sour when a girl's friend takes advantage of her financially, leaving her making car payments alone.




","What's a bad thing everyone should experience once? 

Everyone should experience first hand how money can destroy close relationships and how quickly it can happen.
I was dating a girl who had a lifelong friend with bad credit. like really bad. She wanted to buy a new car, but couldn't get approved for a loan and asked my friend to co-sign. then it turned out her credit was so bad, she couldnt' even use a co-signer they wouldn't issue the loan unless with her name anywhere on it. So she had the idea ""could you buy the car/get the loan, and I'll just make the monthly payments utnil it's paid off"".
I told her ""do not do this. there is a reason she has bad credit"". well, she didn't listen and bought the car for her friend.
her friend made exactly one payment to her, and the next month nothing. She started ditching phone calls, and then we find out she moved out of her apartment. Suddenly this girls family who my friend has known for like 15 years is pretending they don't know where she lives and has no way of getting in contact with her.
A couple more weeks and an envelope with half a car payment (3 weeks late at this point) shows up stuck under my girlfriends doormat. next payment comes due, and nothing.
So now my girlfriend is making the payments every month on a car she hasn't seen in months. her friend who promised to make payments is a payment and a half behind and it's only been 3 months.
The one thing she had listened to me about was she kept a key to the car, so we had the idea we'd find the car and take it (since it was legally and morally her car anyway).
So we spent i don't even know how many weeks every night driving around for hours, hitting this chick's hangout spots, friends houses, family houses, etc until one night we find the car parked in front of her fathers condo.
My girlfriend jumped in, took the car, and drove it to another friends house who was going to let her put it in his garage for a while until things cooled off.

"  friends' college escapade involves giving someone sponge capsules that expand into dinosaurs, leading to a hilarious bathroom experience.




","What is your greatest and most dangerous college story?

Freshman year of college, two of my friends, Josh and Aaron, were sitting in the hallway of their dorm just hanging out. Now, there was a guy on their floor that everyone called Joe Cool because he was always wearing sunglasses and a leather jacket. He would always come in late at night, usually pretty drunk.
Well, on that night, Joe Cool came in around 3 in the morning. He stumbled over to Josh and Aaron and said, ""Guys...guys, you've got to help me. The hangover's going to kill me. You got anything to help take the edge off this?""
Josh just kind of shrugged and said, ""Nah man, can't help you, sorry."" Aaron sat there for a second mthen said, ""Yeah, I think I've got something."" He left, leaving Josh to wonder what the hell he had in mind. Aaron came back a few minutes later with something in his hands.
In his hands were three small pills. One was hot pink. The other was neon green. Another was some kind of purple. He handed them over to Joe Cool, who was really appreciative. ""Dude, you're a saint, man, I really appreciate it, I really do.""
Aaron started cracking up and went back to looking at his computer. A few minutes later, he sat up. ""Wait, did Joe walk away with those?"" ""Yeah dude, why?"" Josh says.
""Oh shit..""
Aaron runs after Joe, and Josh follows him. ""What the hell did you give him, man?!?!""
""I can't tell you...but we need to stop him!""
They find Joe Cool in the bathroom. He's walking away from the sink, having just guzzled the pills down. ""Gee man, thanks again, you're a real lifesaver, you hear?""
Aaron's face turned blue. Josh was really starting to freak out now. ""AARON. Is he going to be okay?!""
""Dude, I don't know. But we need to watch him tonight."" So the two guys found Joe in his room already out cold. They decided to take turns watching him at night, one person sleeping while the other person watches him. A few hours in, though, they screw up and both fall asleep.
Fast forward to the morning and Joe's gone when they wake up. Immediately, Josh and Aaron start freaking out. ""Oh shit, where the hell's Joe Cool?!""
They start looking around, and they eventually find him in the bathroom. He comes walking out of the stall and his face is beet red. He's obviously been crying. His hair is completely sweaty. And he just nervously cries, ""Guys did you see me come in last night?""
""Umm yeah, I guess,"" the guys said.
""Well did I eat anything weird?""
""Uhh, I'm not sure Joe. Why?""
""I don't know what I ate. But I just POOPED A T-REX!! AND A PTERODACTYL...AND I THINK A STEGOSAURUS!!!!
At this point, Aaron just hits the ground laughing. Josh is just sitting there shouting, ""WHAAAAAAAT?!?!?! AARON what did you give him?
Eventually, Aaron is able to stop laughing enough to speak. And he finally reveals what was in those pills: ""Dude dude you know how at the toy store, you can buy those sponge capsules that you put in the water and they expand into dinosaurs? HE JUST TOOK THREE OF THEM!!!"
"  how Coraline, a scary children's book, was initially deemed too frightening for kids until an editor's daughter claimed she wasn't scared.","What are some interesting random facts?

The Book 'Coraline' Was Only Published Because A Girl Lied To Her
Mother. You may be familiar with the children's novel Coraline. Or more likely, you may be familiar with the 2009 movie adaptation of the same name.
But whether put to book or screen, one thing remains the same.
Coraline is one of the scariest pieces of media to be marketed towards children of any generation.
Most kids in my class at school say that Coraline gave them some of their earliest nightmares, terrors, fears and irrational phobias that haunt them to this day. Everything from a haunted house, a lifelike doll and a creepy parallel universe where Coraline nearly gets buttons sewn onto
ner eyes
The fact remains: Coraline is scary. Much too scary for the 6-10 year old audience the book and movie were marketed to. But originally, the book wasn't actually going to be marketed to such a young audience.
When author Neil Gaiman first sent Coraline to be published, his editor said the book was far too scary for children. Refusing to give up, Gaiman said to his editor something along the lines of this
""Read it to your daughter, see if she's scared""
And so, the editor for the publishing house read the book to her daughters. The young girl insisted she wasn't scared of the novel, and so it went to print, marketed to an audience of mainly children.
While that may have worked out on both a critical and commercial level, it also gave many kids nightmares, like I said.
And as it turns out, the 'testing' of the book with the editor's daughter turned out to be a fluke. Nobody can explain this next part better than the author himself. The following excerpt is taken from Neil Gaiman's official Tumblr page:
Adecade later, at the Opening Night of the Coraline musical, I was sitting next to Morgan, Merilee's youngest daughter, and told her how her not being scared had made the book happen. And she said:
""I was terrified. But I needed to find out what happened next. So nobody knew.
So, to summarise, the entire publication, adaptation and success of the Coraline story wouldn't have happened if not for one young girl and her stubborn refusal to admit she was scared.
Bravo, Morgan. You're hardcore."
  the narrator warns against consuming Pringles Fat-Free chips due to the excessive grease and unpleasant consequences experienced firsthand.,"What’s Something Everyone Eats But Is Absolutely Terrible For You?

DO NOT EAT PRINGLES FAT FREE POTATO CHIPS. THEY WILL GREASE YOUR ASS. Don't even f ing say a word. I like potato chips, and can't eat them very much or I'll get fat.
I tried out these Pringles Fat-Free chips because they were super low-cal. BBQ flavor. the hell.
The can said they had 70 calories per serving, which meant the whole can had 490 calories inside total. I could munch through a can in a day with my lunch, dinner, etc. So I got several cans, and began enjoying one a day for the past four days. But what they dont f ing tell you
Except in tiny print you cant read without a f ing electron microscope
is that the primary ingredient is something called ""olean"" which I have since learned is Latin for ""Unwashable & Indestructible Ass Grease.""
Oh Yeah. I'm not even kidding.
So today, while I'm standing in the living room debating whether or not Laundry or Dishes will get done first, I get the urge to fart. I live alone, so sweet. I let the honk loose and its wrong. Something just sounded wrong. I know my own wind, and I have never farted a sound that sounded like a fart wrapped in a pillow.
Oh yes, something was very wrong. I had just shat myself. But this evil olean makes shitting yourself sound almost like a regular fart, and had I not been particularly attentive, it could easily have gone unnoticed, I'm telling you. THAT's how utterly covert and evil this olean stuff is. What the hell?! What if I'd gone out to hang with friends or gone for a drive, what then?
So I walk carefully to the bathroom and disrobe. before I even sit on the toilet, I wad paper and carefully wipe from the front. Sure enough, it was light brown, and had the texture of soft spackle. You f ing Pringle bastards.
I sat down and pushed a bit, and lo, out came a jet that I didnt even feel an urge for one minute earlier. It piled in the bowl like brown marshmallow fluff.
The problem rose when I tried to wipe. I went through a whole f ing roll of TP and could not get it all off me. So.
I jumped in the shower. Yep, its gross, but it had to be done. There I stood, water pouring down, cheeks spread, and using my own hand to make certain I'm clean.
That was when I discovered that after using my hand to wipe myself (before I soaped the area) my hand came back covered in some sort of transparent grease. It was so f ing foul. The grease made water bead off my hand. It was tacky too, and very difficult to manage.
So I grabbed the bar of saop and went to work.
You f ing Pringle bastards.
The bar of soap came away coated in grease as well, and would no longer wash. I had to turn the water to hot and massage the soap for five minutes to get it to the point where I could use it again. It took me an hour to get the f ing grease off my pucker. I shudder to think of what its doing INSIDE ME right now, but I will damned sure never eat that shit again.
F ing Pringle bastards."
"  husband's odd reaction to sister's pregnancy: silence, vomiting, emotional distress. Past implications fuel suspicion. Uncertainty lingers.","What’s The Strangest Reaction To A Pregnancy You’ve Witnessed?

My husband and I were at my parents house for dinner. All was going well. We were talking, laughing and eating. But as soon as my sister got from her seat and announced her pregnancy. I noticed at first that my husband got quiet, didn't get up to congratulate her since the rest of us did, and just kept staring at or towards her I'm not entirely sure. I repeatedly asked if he was okay and he mumbled about feeling a bit sick. That was strange because he was perfectly fine that day. Literally, moments later he started throwing up. Like I had no idea what was happening with him. He sat on the bathroom floor near the toilet just looking down and refusing to let me help him up to wash his face. I kept asking him if he was okay but no response. My family were worried about him and I had to take him home. I checked his temp and blood pressure but all were normal. Still complete silence on his part. He went to sleep shortly after and in the early morning at 5:30. I woke up to the sound of him crying in the shower. I rushed in asking if he was okay but still no response other than tell me he needed a minute with himself.
I almost lost it demanding he explain what was going on and he told me he was just feeling overwhelmed, from what?!?! He's not the type who gets stressed out from work or anything of the sort. This is just so strange and out of character of him. He got dressed and left then refused to even talk about it.
I can't help but feel like this reaction was triggered by my sister's pregnancy announcement since this is all started right after she made it. What makes me feel so horrible is the fact that my sister once implied that my husband was her type and hoped to get someone like him. She has a boyfriend by the way. This could be nothing but I can't shake this weird feeling about what happened. Are you guys thinking what I’m thinking?"
"  the man-baby's privileged and lazy lifestyle comes crashing down as his family takes action, leading to a legendary meltdown.","The man-baby is finally facing the music

My brother is 31 years old. In his time on earth, he has not had to lift a finger to keep any of his needs met. He dropped out of college after less than half a semester because he could not bother rolling out of bed before noon to take the car our parents got him to class. He's worked a combination of 2 and a half months in his entire life. He lost his first job at a dairy queen because he swore at a mother over the drive-through speakers, and lost his second because he got caught stealing from the till of a family-owned restaurant. He has spent the last 8 years rolling out of bed at 2 pm to do nothing but play video games and troll discord servers to find someone just as pathetic as him to hang out with. It does not help that he's an annoying, violent, self-centered brat who would push my parents in front of a bus for the thrill of the dopamine hit.
My parents always tried their best with us. They gave us everything we ever needed in life and then some. They have always been more than understanding to all of their children. For me and my two siblings who are worth something, it lead to incredible performances in academia, well-paying jobs, and an amazing start to our adult lives. I wish I could comend them for the 75% success rate. But, they have allowed the man baby to sit in his cradle and make demands for 31 years too long. And now, they find themselves with an overgrown toddler who sits in the attic playing valorant all day while cursing my mom out when she dares to ask him to clean up the rotting garbage he spreads across his room.
Last year, dad had a stroke. He is now at a point where he needs 24-hour care from a professional. My mother is burned out. She retired when dad had the stroke to take care of him, and it's done more damage to their relationship than 33 years of marriage could ever do. It does not help that they are perpetually harassed by the child demanding his dinner be delivered to him while he screams at teenagers over the internet.
Me, all my human siblings, and my parents have been talking for months now about solutions. At the beginning of the month, we decided dad is going to a care center. Mom will sell the house to move to a 55+ community close to dad, and the man baby will hopefully find a box with an internet connection. Mom and dad have always protected him, but my guess is the stroke finally woke them up to the reality of the situation. Yeah, it sucks, and they are to blame for allowing him to get to this point. But, there comes a time to cut your losses and admit you messed up and move on. It's a shame all of the man babies' siblings, including myself, hate his guts. None of us care what happens to him, and it's interesting to say that out loud now that I think about it.
I got the privilege to be there yesterday when he got the news. Mom's going to be moving in with sis till the house sells, dads going to the care center next week, and movers will be clearing the place out starting pretty much now. He has a month, the eviction process is already rolling. The non-emergency line already knows that his temperamental and violent behind has been served and is ready to respond if he does something stupid. Oh, and our firefighter neighbor will be over in only a few minutes if he needs his ass put in gear on short notice.
It was wonderful. His meltdown was legendary. He actually stomped his feet and screamed that it's not fair. Said he was going to sue us all, screamed in an elderly man's face saying he wants to kick his ass. He demanded to know what we were going to do to help him find a place to live, how much money we were going to give him to make sure he didn't end up on the streets, asked what he's supposed to do about the fact he was saving his money to buy a new graphics card. He somehow still does not understand exactly what he is now facing. He's now not talking to mom or dad, he's locked himself in his room since last night and only comes out to use the restroom and take food from the pantry that will not be filling itself anymore. It's great as my brother is staying there and working remotely to make sure he does not try anything, and to update me and my sister on the man-babies tantrum."
"  family shares a peculiar tradition of using a designated ""poop knife"" to deal with their large bowel movements, hidden from others.","What’s a Tradition Your Family Has That You Have To Hide From Others.

My family poops big. Maybe it's genetic, maybe it's our diet, but everyone births giant logs of crap. If anyone has laid a mega-poop, you know that sometimes it won't flush. It lays across the hole in the bottom of the bowl and the vortex of draining water merely gives it a spin as it mocks you. Growing up, this was a common enough occurrence that our family had a poop knife. It was an old rusty kitchen knife that hung on a nail in the laundry room, only to be used for that purpose. It was normal to walk through the hallway and have someone call out ""hey, can you get me the poop knife""? I thought it was standard kit. You have your plunger, your toilet brush, and your poop knife. Fast forward to 22. It's been a day or two between poops and I'm over at my friend's house. My friend was the local dealer and always had 'guests' over, because you can't buy weed without sitting on your ass and sampling it for an hour. I excuse myself and lay a gigantic turd. I look down and see that it's a sideways one, so I crack the door and call out for my friend. He arrives and I ask him for his poop knife. ""My what?"" Your poop knife, I say. I need to use it. Please. ""What the hell is a poop knife?"" Obviously he has one, but maybe he calls it by a more delicate name. A fecal cleaver? A Dung divider? A guano glaive? I explain what it is I want and why I want it. He starts giggling. Then laughing. Then lots of people start laughing. It turns out, the music stopped and everyone heard my pleas through the door. It also turns out that none of them had poop knives, it was just my messed  up family with their messed up bowels. F my life. I told this to my wife last night, who was amused and horrified at the same time. It turns out that she did not know what a poop knife was and had been using the old rusty knife hanging in the utility closet as a basic utility knife. Thankfully she didn't cook with it, but used it to open Amazon boxes. She will be getting her own utility knife now."
"  woodworking passion turned into a side hustle, growing into a full-time business. Overcame setbacks, collaborated with others, and inherited fortune.","Millionaires of reddit, how did you become so wealthy?

I was never too good in school, could read and write and do basic maths but nothing more. I did really enjoy woodworking though and anything using my hands.
I left school as soon as I could as I wanted to leave home. Lived in pretty shitty places just scraping by on pretty much minimal wage working retail and hospitality until a mate of mine said I could probably make money on the side with my wood-working (he'd seen bits and pieces I'd made around the house).
There was no etsy back then so I had to do most of my stuff without any research as to what people would like and then try to hawk it via classifed and cards in local shops. I couldn't believe it when my first piece sold even though for the time I'd spent making it I hadn't even made minimum wage! However I kept at it and made a variety of ornaments which people liked and then started doing commissions. Thinks got bigger and bigger and I could quit my shitty job to do it full time. Within a couple of years of selling my first piece I was getting more requests than I could fulfill but still only making an OK living out of it.
About 3 years to the day from my first-ever sale I actually had a motobike accident and lost the use of my left hand (fortunately not my dominant hand!). I decided to try and get a couple of the local homeless guys to help out and provide them with meals and a share of the sale prices. Obviously this meant we could make and I could sell many more pieces but I actually found I was making less money once stuff was split up. And to add insult to injury a couple of the guys ripped me off and stole a lot of my stuff. I was back at square one.
I decided to move back into making more basic pieces that would be quicker and simpler and that's when my mum died and left me a million dollars."
"  drug dealer offered underwhelming compensation: $9 in gift cards, a broken camera, and a bag of pennies as payment for drugs.","Drug dealers, what is the strangest thing you’ve been offered in compensation for drugs?

I have two great stories for this.
I had a 'friend' begging me to bring something over to him. When I asked about payment he said he had something better than money, and that I'd be pleased with it. He wouldn't say what it was, but made it sound like it wasn't safe to mention over the phone. From the way he was talking it seriously sounded like extremely hush-hush. I was intrigued.
It ended up being like a total of $9 across 3 gift cards, a shitty digital camera, and an old phone that was missing the battery. He said the digital camera could be sold at a pawn shop, the phone could be used to hide drugs until I got a battery for it, and the gift cards were just 'something extra' he felt like throwing in to sweeten the deal. I starred blankly at him and never took orders from him again.
I also had an incident where a friend of mine needed to buy and I decided to hit up my connect to pick up on their behalf. The friend picks me up, drives me to the dealers house, and I ask them for the money before I head inside. They reach behind the seat and pulled out a ziploc bag full of pennies and was like ""Trust me, it's all there"""
"  girlfriend seeks help from her brother's friend for PC upgrade, but his pushy behavior and incompetence lead to costly mistakes.","What is the smallest amount of power you’ve seen go to someone’s head?

My girlfriend and I are avid PC gamers, although she doesn't know too much about computers so when it comes to building and setting up a PC I'm the one who does it all for her.
A while ago I was away for the week with my parents while my girlfriend was back home, and she messaged me asking if I thought she needed a graphics card upgrade. I decided she may as well if she had the money because her build was getting a bit old and she wanted to play some more recent games. I told her to wait until I got back so I could help her pick one out and we'd get it sorted out.
The next day I get a message from her saying that she's ordered a new graphics card. I ask her why she's done it without me, and she tells me that her brother had mentioned how he has this friend who is really good with computers, and that he could sort it out for her so she didn't have to wait. Her brother is a trustworthy guy so I wasn't bothered by that, it was his friend who was the problem.
My girlfriend then explains to me that her brother's friend asked her what her budget was and basically just recommended her the best AMD GPU for that price. She thanked him for the advice and said she'd ask me, but apparently he was very pushy, acted very big headed, and started to tell my girlfriend that she had to order this graphics card now because it was the best she was going to get.
She got intimidated by him and her brother just blindly agreed with the guy, so she ended up buying the card. A day or so later the card turns up and the guy comes over to my girlfriend's house to fit it for her. Apparently he spent a lot of time trying to fit it, only to tell my girlfriend that it wasn't working (what a surprise). She told him to not worry and that I'd be back soon to fix it anyway; she just wanted him gone asap. He insisted that he give it another go and spent a while longer trying to get it to work before finally telling her that the problem was that her power supply ""wasnt good enough"" (i.e. the card he recommended required 2 PCIe but she only had 1).
Once again this guy starts telling my girlfriend what she should buy, asks her how much she wants to spend on a power supply and recommends the best Corsair supply for that money. She just wants her PC fixed at this point so she goes along with it and orders it. The guy turns up to install the power supply and would you believe it there's another problem! He's ordered her a power supply that won't physically fit in the case. At this point I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry because this guy is clearly an idiot on a power trip, bossing my girlfriend around and costing her money.
My girlfriend then orders a new case (recommended by me this time), which turns up just before I get home. I go over to my girlfriend's house and put the PC together for her and it works. She tells me that's the last time she's trusting that guy for help and I agree. She sends him a thank you message a what out of courtesy and he replies with something along the lines of ""Looks like your computer was just so old that you needed several parts upgraded haha. Maybe you should have just bought a new Alienware PC instead, they're so much better"". No you're welcome or anything, he just acted like it was all my girlfriend's fault."

I spent months trying to solve the problem on my own and was simply jerked around and treated like a criminal by Social Security.

I was playing Rainbow Six Vegas a while back. Got myself a few friends in, and also had a couple of stragglers. We were pretty decent as decent as team, we'd not lost for a few days although playtime had only been a few hours due to work. Anyway these stragglers who joined got added to our chat, talked strategy with them they seemed alright. Two brothers from Georgia.
We start playing, and we're abseiling down the roof, running through casinos and everything is going well. Our squad are racking up kills, but one of the stragglers keeps dying. His brother is complaining.
Guy who keeps dying grabs the briefcase and runs, we're calling to get him him to come to the lift shafts but he ignored us, runs straight to the windows and gets taken out. Drops the case in a room packed with enemies. We can't get it in time, we lose. The useful brother starts complaining and muttering under his breath, then talks louder like we couldn't hear him before, and says sorry about his brothers mistake. We'll win now.
We switch to defense. The useless brother runs straight out of the vault, despite telling him to wait at the back stairs, goes and gets killed. His brother is mumbling again, clearly agitated. Now, the useful brother is defending the case, any one who gets past the 3 main defence points he is picking them off and doing great. Case never leaves our sight. Despite the back stairs not being covered.
Useless brother sees someone in the case room. Decides to throw a flash bang, we all get blinded. Look around, case is gone. As we're going chasing after it, the useless bro apologies. His brother says 'whatever' and in his mumble voice he seemingly thinks no one can hear says ""this is the exact crap that made me shit in your gym bag""
The character of the useless bro stops dead in front of me as we're chasing the enemy. Then there's a loud noise on the other bros mic, followed by what sounded like the the biggest bitch slap, open palm strike whatever I've ever heard. Useful bros character suddenly stops too. Me and my squad are laughing, wondering what's going on, as we lose the game, and on the mics we can just hear one of the bros crying... And then a mom shouting in the distance."
  person survived hernia surgery but unexpectedly found rare appendix cancer; early detection and treatment saved their life. ,"What is NOT a bullet you dodged, but a huge tactical nuke you dodged?

Broke my belly button over eating at a company lunch, went from an innie to an outie (Hernia). Put off going to the doctor for a few weeks before going to see a specialist. Hernia doctor said yep its a hernia we're in a pandemic we can schedule you for whenever if you want to wait a bit there shouldn't be any problems no hurry. I decided to get it out of the way they had a cancelation so I scheduled for a week later. I wake up from surgery and the Doc says there was a complication they didn't get to the Hernia when they were going in they noticed my appendix was about to explode so they took that out instead (still not the tactical nuke). I asked about when they could fix the hernia he said the appendix looked funny and was going to send it to the lab and get back to me. The lab was really backed up from the pandemic so several weeks later I get a call from the doc. It was a really rare appendix cancer something that happens to around 1000 Americans a year, not only that but of the 2 kinds of appendix cancer based on lab work I had the worst of the 2, the kind that spreads everywhere really fast and cuts your lifespan down considerably even with treatment. The 1st kind grows slow and stays put but every once in awhile it will go into overdrive differentiates, pokes out of the abdominal wall and spits cancer slime everywhere that turns whatever it touches into more cancer. The cut off for it turning from good into the bad kind is 1 centimeter tumor, mine as 1.5 centimeter, under the microscope it had differentiated and they saw the cells that spit cancer slime had formed. There's really only one treatment referred to as the mother of all surgeries which is it's own ball of tactical nukes. I stew over that for a few weeks till they can get more tests scheduled (still in pandemic so it takes awhile). Go in for a barrage of scans, poking's and prodding's and the scans are all clean no signs of cancer spread (mostly). It had just turned from the slow growing kind that stays put into the fast moving kind and hadn't had a chance to spit cancer slime outside the wall holding my appendix if I had waited just a week for the hernia surgery, literally everyday that I waited would have exponentially increased the odds of it spreading the mucin. They think they got it all when they took the appendix out. There's a few things they want to keep an eye on that they're reasonably sure is just scaring from the surgery but they gave me an 80% chance of being cancer free. I have more scans in December to make sure."

Plenty of times, but one in particular stands out. Me and my partner respond to a call of a domestic incident, female caller states her husband throw her into the dresser and broke the bathroom door.
So we get there and as we are walking up the driveway this woman comes screaming out wearing only shorts, no shirt, no bra. Anyway we prepare for the worst, figuring he was gonna follow her, coming after her. Well we keep her outside for a min, when its clear he wasnt coming out we go inside with her. By this time another car arrives with two more cops.
So we go inside and she sits on the couch and covers herself with a blanket. We notice she has a nice bump on her head and elbow. She says her husband just got home after completing two tours in Iraq...Just got home...2 hours ago. She picked him up from the airport. He gets home, takes and first thing he does is take a shower. She says "" I have no idea what happened. he got out of the shower, grabbed me and threw me at the dresser where i hit my head and elbow, then i came downstairs and called you guys"".
So we go upstairs and find the guy sitting on the bed, with his head in his hands crying. He look up at us and says "" I'm so f’ing sorry"" I didnt mean to do it. Without being prompted he tells his story.
She picked me up from the airport and drove home. I come inside and jump in the shower. When I get out I knock over the garbage can in the bathroom and it falls over. he went to pick it up and saw inside it was FILLED to the brim with used rubbers. Like a box worth. And he was right, the garbage can was filled with rubbers, that obviously weren't his.
He said he came out and confronted her about to which she just shrugged her shoulders and said ""oh well, you werent here"". So he grabbed her and pushed her away from him in frustration. She hit the dresser and fell to the floor, running out of the room. He gets frustrated and punches the bathroom door, putting a hole in it.
Well we had no choice, we had to arrest him. Charged him with Assault 3rd. I'm not condoning what the guy did, but I understand it. He was off fighting in a war for two tours while his girlfriend was living in his house, driving his car, having s x with other men in his bed.

"  war veteran's shocking deathbed confession reveals he became a ruthless killer, torturing and inflicting agony on enemy troops during combat.","[Serious] What is the most shocking thing someone confessed on their deathbed?

My grandpas whole career was in the military. He joined just after World War II since he had just turned 18 as WWII ended. Him and his 6 brothers all joined at the same time. Their first time seeing combat was in Korea. My grandpa was a paratrooper and one of his brothers was a field medic. The 6 didn't get put into any of the same squads for some reason. He said that during a really intense fire fight, his squad crossed paths with his brothers squad. His brother was trying to help an injured squad member when he was shot 3 times. Twice in the back and once in the chest. My grandpa ran to drag him out of the way and pulled him behind cover. He held his brother in his arm behind cover and comforted him as he died. They both knew his brother wasn't making it out of this serious injury. His brother died a few minutes after being shot and this made something in my grandpas head just snap.
He said for the rest of the war, he used the Koreans as his way of dealing with the anger of his brother dying. He went from being a terrified, inexperienced combat troop to a killing machine. He said during the rest of the war, he felt no fear, only hatred. He would fight with incredible zeal and ferocity. He didn't specify how many people he actually killed. All he said was ""The day my brother died was the day I became a killer"". He didn't say how many he actually killed because ""If I told you, you would see me as a much different man. I wasn't a man at that point. I was a cold hearted murderer out to watch them suffer"". He claimed that when the opportunity came, he would actively try to inflict as much agony on enemy troops as possible. When they were injured and on the ground, he would beat them, kick them, cut off their fingers, knock their teeth out, stomp on their legs to break them etc. He only did this when there was no other allies around. He literally started acting like a serial killer torturing his victims and didn't want any of his fellow troops to see him do this. It was dishonorable and inhumane but he didn't care. He was just filled with rage.
My grandpa received a purple heart and multiple prestigious military honors once the war was over. He said that if anyone found out about the horrors and inhumane actions he committed during the war, the awards would probably have been taken away. He said his time in Korea was the only time he felt like something other than human. He said it made him feel like a truly evil force, and he liked it. This shocked us since he was the kindest, most gentle man I had ever known. He never swore, never got angry and was incredibly tame and loving. His marriage was fantastic and he made sure to show my dad and my aunt nothing but love when they were growing up. You would never take him as the type of guy to excitedly kill people in battle. My grandpa died with a lot of secrets that we will now never know. He only confessed to his horribly dirty fighting tactics in war because he wanted to die with some of his conscience clear. He never even told my grandma about what he did during the war until this point.
I believe he had some underlying problems that led to him acting like he did in war. He said it was a blood lust that he had never felt before and the sight of enemy Koreans suffering in pain got him excited and bursting with happiness. My grandpa wasn't a bad man. I believe the stress of the war and his brother dying in his arms was enough for him to go against everything he previously stood for. He went into the war with the intent to serve his country but ended up fighting for his own blood lust and rage. I can't ask him to tell me more since he's been long dead, but I believe he did much worse than just torture injured enemies."
"  a survival tip during nuclear detonation: Seek sturdy shelter, lie down, and distance yourself to minimize exposure to blast and radiation.




","What knowledge might save your life one day?

If you're on a walk, a few miles away from a military target (power plant, industrial center, army base, ect, which are more common than you think so check in your area) and you suddenly see a bright flash in the distance. Odds are good this is a nuclear detonation! If you're at ground zero you're dead, but if you're a mile away or more you have several precious seconds with which you can do a few simple things to drastically increase your chances of survival.
While the heat from the blast will kill anyone at ground zero, further out the biggest danger is the pressure wave. To survive it, you need to put something sturdy between you and the blast, preferably with nothing above you (a roof will likely collapse on you). A ditch, concrete barrier, low wall, etc.If you're indoors already and don't have time to get outside to a ditch, follow tornado rules: get to the basement, or under a stairwell or, as a last resort, doorframe. Also try to get to the far side of the building from the blast, the wall facing the blast is the most likely to collapse.
Once in your ""safe"" location, lie down on your stomach, turn your face away from the blast, close your eyes tight, and open your mouth. You can also cup your hands over your ears (that blast is going to be loud), but be careful not to form a seal or the pressure wave could blow out your eardrums.
Once the pressure wave has passed...stay down. Wait for the reaction wave to go back in the other direction before your stand up; it's not going to be nearly as powerful as the initial wave, but may still have enough oomf to knock you over and/or throw things at you.
Once the pressure wave is done, the worst of the danger is over. Radiation is still a concern, but you've got a few hours before the bulk of it starts falling from the sky; during that time, put as much distance between you and the blast as possible, preferably traveling upwind. Remember, nuclear radiation is basically dust: if you protect yourself from dust originating at ground zero, you're protecting yourself from the majority of the dangerous radiation."
"  friend subtly messes with best friend by moving his trash bin closer to the house and eventually inside, causing paranoia.","Whats a simple everyday approach to slightly mess with people, without them picking up on it?

For almost 3 months I would drive by my best friends house after every day except trash day. He always put the bin in the same corner next to his garage, so throughout the week leading up to trash day, I moved the bin slightly closer to the house. I had a system... he'd always move it back to the corner, but every day I'd move it. About a month in, he started mentioning the moving bin in conversation. ""I think someone's f’ing with my trash."" ""Nah, stop being paranoid."" In the last week that I did this, the build up was showing. He would go home to check more often, even going as far as to install a bunch of motion sensor lights. Now being his best friend, I had knowledge of where he kept a spare key to his house. So finally, the day before trash day, I put the bin in his house. He. Went. Insane. We're talking cameras outside, even shopped for security systems. I never told him. Sorry, Dan."
"  how Joan of Arc, with no military experience or resources, took charge, led armies, and fearlessly defied authority, exemplifying ""do it myself.""




","What’s the greatest “Fuck it I’ll do it myself” in history?

Joan of Arc's entire career was a giant f it, I'll do it myself.
She had no military experience, she had no money, and she was only in her mid-teens. But her country was losing a war, and so f it.
She talked her way into a meeting with the king, talked her way into a sword and a suit of armor and a horse, and talked her way into permission to travel with a supply train. When she got to the siege the guys who were actually running the siege treated her like a mascot, but f it.
She crashed war meetings where she hadn't been invited and pretty much told everybody to go f themselves. Then went off to lead soldiers into battle. Strangely enough, the soldiers followed her. Even more strangely, they started capturing towers. Then she got shot in the shoulder with a crossbow bolt. It was just about the same wound that had killed Richard the Lionheart two centuries earlier, but once again f it.
She pulled the bolt out with her own hands. Which isn't exactly the smart thing to do with puncture wounds--but f it. She grabbed a banner and rallied the next charge. Which was a pretty damn good thing because that was about the time the enemy army decided to give up the siege. She could have rested up and gone home at that point. After all she pretty much only had one usable arm at that point, but f it.
She started capturing more strongholds. After a particularly lopsided battle called the Battle of Patay the enemy army was decimated. So she led her king on a march to get a proper coronation but there were a lot of towns under enemy control along the way. This could pose a problem, but f it.
That string of towns switched without a fight. Because, f, she had the whole Army with her. Then there was no formal role for a peasant girl from the middle of nowhere at a royal coronation, but f it.
She stood beside the king holding her banner while he got crowned. Now as an example of exactly what bad shape things were generally for France at that point, Paris was behind enemy lines. Once again, f it.
She attacked Paris. And once again got shot (this time in the leg). She refused to leave the field and kept directing troops. At about this time the political scene at court started turning against her because she was getting far too powerful, far too fast, and she was chronically insubordinate. She didn't get the chance to lead the main army again, but f it.
She kept leading small forces. Because this was the feudal era and troops were loyal to a particular lord, not like modern military structure. So there were noblemen who respected her accomplishments enough that they invited her to command the troops under them. How she figured out tactics so fast without any experience is kind of a mystery, but a lot of it seems to be that she was aggressive and pushed an advantage at a time when the norm had been demoralized and timid. They also said she had a knack for artillery placement (artillery being mostly crossbows and really primitive muzzle loading proto-cannons). Without the main army there wasn't a whole lot to work with, but f it.
After a few more small battles she got captured. F.
She did her level best to escape and nearly broke free, because f it.
You probably heard about the rest: a kangaroo court trial where she sparred with her judges verbally every day. Several transcripts survive where she threatens her judges to fear for their souls. All of them were learned churchmen including a bishop, but f it. ...and guess who's the only person from that courtroom who got made a saint?"
  a lifeguard at a waterpark faced an entitled parent who demanded special treatment due to their Diamond Elite Membership.,"Has another parent ever got mad at you for saying 'no' to their child?

Has another parent ever got mad at you for saying 'no' to their child? Yes! I’m not a parent, but I’m a lifeguard at a local waterpark. If you’re ever been to a huge waterpark, like Universal or Disney, then you know that there are these tall towers attached to water slides. That day, my job was to guard one of our most popular slides for maintenance. There are a total of like 6 slides on that tower, including 2 that put you in a tube and drop you. I basically had to tell everybody in the park one by one that the tower (and therefore every slide on it) was closed as they tried to enter. Another piece of important context: the park that I work for has this membership tiers, and the highest one has different benefits that include, early access to the park, preferred and free parking, large discounts on merchandise and food, either free or extremely discounted fast passes (I’m not entirely sure on that one), and preferred seating in places like the theater in the next door theme park and in the shade at the waterpark. This is called the Diamond Elite Membership. Now don’t get me wrong, most of these members are really nice and just want to have a good time with their families. However, there are a few who are just a little too entitled. Ok, back to the story. So this tower that I’m guarding is right next to the diamond seating (this will be important in a sec). I’m just doing my thing, informing guests that the tower is down, apologizing for the inconvenience and recommending other slides. Then enters this child. He walks over to me and I tell him that “I’m sorry but this entire tower is closed today due to maintenance. If you want-” He interrupts me and asks me if every slide individually is open, with my same response of the entire tower being closed. After he realizes that I’m not going to let him up, he (a child who is at least 13 years old) calls for his “mommy,” who comes running and gives me this nasty look when I tell her to walk. She, already annoyed, asks her kid what the problem is. He says that the “mean lifeguard” won’t let him ride the slides. When she asks me why I tell her that the entire tower is closed to ALL GUESTS due to maintenance. She then holds up her lanyard with her Diamond Elite Membership card in it and says, “Are you blind? Can you not see that we are Diamond Elite Members? That obviously doesn’t apply to us. Let my son up that tower now!” I respond with a simple, “I’m sorry ma’am, but this tower is closed to all guests today due to maintenance.” She then tries to tell me (more like scream at me) multiple times that closed to all guests doesn’t apply to her son because they are Diamond Elite Members. At this point they’re being so loud that I don’t even have to call over the headguard (the lifeguards who watch the other lifeguards and make sure that they are doing their jobs) in my area. He just comes over himself. But before he gets there, the woman points up to the top of the tower and says “Well if my kid can’t go and ride the slides then why are those people up there?” I look up and see that there are people at the top of the tower…in bright orange vests and hard hats. So I respond with “The maintenance workers? They’re doing maintenance on the slides.” Now this is when the child goes full Dudley Dursley and starts crying about how it’s not fair and that he wants to ride the slides and his entire day is ruined. Now, this is when I lose all sympathy for them. These memberships are expensive. That means that nobody would buy them without the intention of coming back at least enough times to make the payment worth it. They could simply come back to the park later as it would cost them no extra money and ride the slides then. Also, she said that I needed to call over a supervisor or a manager so that she could have me fired. At that point, with nothing less than perfect timing, my headguard finally gets over to where I am and gets the story. They tried to tell him that I was being extremely rude and that I needed to be fired for not doing my job. My headguard said the EXACT SAME THING THAT I DID and she went on this whole rant saying things like, “what the f*ck is wrong with you? Are you all missing brain cells? This little sh*t here doesn’t understand that the customer is always right and you should too! Where’s your manager I want you both f*cking fired right now!” My headguard then says the best thing EVER! “Ma’am, I’m sorry but this is a family friendly park. On top of harassing this lifeguard about benefits that you don’t have, you are also using language that is prohibited in the park. I’m going to have to ask you to leave.”"
"  car accident culprit bailed out, turns out the station head was his father, resolving the issue through an incredible coincidence.","What's the most incredible coincidence that ever happened to you? 

One day, my car was hit in a car accident. The police found that it was the other person’s fault and took him to jail for not having insurance. When I went to see what I should do next, I found out that someone bailed him out. Until now, things are okay and I thought that it’s going to be okay. 9 months in, the guy doesn’t answer any calls and claims that I’m the one who should be blamed for the accident. People at the station knew me because I come every few days (don’t blame me as fixing the car is estimated to be $4,000). Anyhow, they advised me to go and escalate to the head of that station and see what can he do. I went there and gave him the entire story. Once I was done, he called someone from his office and told him to help me close the case. I gave this guy everything and he made one call to the guy I’m looking for. I told him he doesn’t answer his phone. But surprisingly, the guy answered and I heard a lot of shouting and the guy on the other end of the line saying nothing at all. The call ended and immediately I got a call saying that my money will be ready tomorrow! I thanked the guy and asked him what caused him to change so dramatically. His answer was: “I’m his father.”"
"  a kidnapping victim outsmarted captor by pretending to have STD, gaining safety and avoiding assault, eventually leading to her release.




"," If you could say 3 things to make your kidnapper uncomfortable, what would they be?

 If you could say 3 things to make your kidnapper uncomfortable, what would they be? I was watching a true crime show the other day and this girl had been car jacked. The suspect had already assaulted and murdered another young girl. This new girl, he was trying to have her drive him across the country @ gunpoint. They eventually stopped at a hotel to sleep. While there, he threatened to end her if she told the clerk, didn't let her out of his sight, etc. Police were already looking for the suspect as his wife was a COP and he had stolen her gun and run off after confessing to the first assault/murder. The dude obviously knew he was wanted and was very paranoid. While in the hotel, he proceeded to tie the girl to the bed and fed her sleeping pills. So, she obviously knew what he was about to s x assault her. At this point, the girls phone started making noise. It was just an alarm clock app on her phone. This guy was so paranoid, he started accusing her of being an undercover, threatening to kill her, and she explained it was just an alarm. (I'd assume it was left over from a nap the previous day or that, like many girls, she sets an alarm to take her birth control at the same time every day) After the girl calmed the kidnapper down, she explained that it was the alarm for her to take her STD medication. She said she had some kind of nasty STD and if she forgot take the pill, she'd have pain, itching, etc. This apparently worked. The guy didn't want to get an STD, so he didn't assault her, he just went to sleep. Eventually, this girl kind of befriended her kidnapper? (I guess on a cross country drive, you have to talk to each other at some point.)At that point law enforcement was tracking the new vehicle, because the guy had tried to rob and shoot another person after they left the hotel, and that victim survived his wounds and managed to get a license plate number. When law enforcement tried to pull them over a few days later, the wanted man called 911, while they were being chased. Before he would agree to stop for the officers, he ensured that they knew that the girl had been carjacked, and that she had NOTHING to do with his crimes, and asked them not to shoot, as his victim “was a really sweet girl, from a good family”. He was taken peacefully. But because he spoke so highly of his victim, SHE was wrongly suspected and arrested as a co-conspirator. However, they quickly figured out she was just a victim and she was released."
  persistent phone calls and messages intended for the previous owner cause ongoing frustration for the current number holder.,"This is what happens when you’re still handing out your old number after 5 years?

So, I've had my number for 5 years, maybe 6, I don't remember exactly. When I got this number, the previous owner still got regular messages and phone calls, which is completely understandable that she didn't have everyone up to date on her newest number or lack of number. The first 3 months it was nothing to me, I'd answer the calls, send them on their way. Well, that was until I got a phone call from an elementary school looking for, let's call her Sarah. Sarah's daughter was throwing up and running a high fever and needed to go home. I told the school that this was a new number for me and there was no Sarah around. I thought certainly this issue would make her come to the realization that she needed to update her number. But no. I had to block the schools number because I continued to get calls and texts that had way too much information about Sarah's daughter. Including her name, age, and school events with times and changes in school schedules. I wasn't comfortable receiving that info, so I blocked it. Maybe 2 or 3 weeks after i blocked the school, Sarah's grandmother calls me because I assume the school couldn't get ahold of Sarah. But I have to tell grandma that I'm not Sarah & to please ask her granddaughter to update her information. Sarah still did not. With all of the information that I unwillingly had on Sarah (full name, age, where she attends college, her home address, and where she works), I found her on Facebook and kindly asked her to not use her old number anymore. I'm not sure if she saw the message or not, but it didn't help my problem. This has been ongoing for years and it's not just spam, it's people she knows, co-workers, family, doctors, her real estate agent even.... So, before, if she had appointments that were asking to be verified via text to my phone, I would just ignore them. But she had an appointment this time and I am just so fed up of Sarah STILL giving out this number after 5 years of this nonsense that I canceled her appointment for her. A few days later, a new appointment to the same place needed verification & I canceled it again. And the next one I get will be cancelled also. Get your shit together Sarah!!"
  person retaliated against a driver blinding him with high-beams by using an extremely bright flashlight to blind him in return.,"Guy behind me in traffic was blinding me in traffic with his high-beams, so i violated his retinas 

I was driving home from work and traffic was backed up pretty badly for a few miles. It was stop and go. When i get stuck in that, i'll usually back about 75 feet off the car in front of me so that i can hold a pace and move at a slow, but constant roll - like the semi trucks do. This way im not participating in the bumper to bumper move and brake like the rest of the smooth brain drivers. Some dude in an Acura Crossover was behind me, and i guess he was getting upset because i wasn't 2 feet from the car in front of me, driving like a smoothbrain. So he gets up on my butt and starts beeping his horn at me. ""Lol"" i think to myself as i turn up my radio. But then he starts flashing his brights at me, which is where i get annoyed. He's in one of those acuras that has the super bright LED headlights. My car is much lower than his, so his low beams are already pretty bright in my mirrors. Bright enough that i dont want to look in them. The first time he flashed his highbeams it put spots in my vision for a moment. It genuinely hurt my eyes. After the first flash, he waits for about 10 seconds, beeps his horn, and then flashes me again. Now im getting pissed. Im thinking ""where the eff do you want me to go? Do you really think being two feet from the car in front of you will make traffic move faster?"" Then he flashes me a third time, but this time he held them on for about 15 seconds. Time for the gloves to come off. During those 15 seconds, as im looking away from my mirrors, i see my 14,000 lumen searchlight sitting in my passenger seat, at which point I'm immediately overcome by a wave of chaotic-lawful excitement, what he has just set in motion can not be stopped. I think to my self ""oh buddy....you just opened the wrongggg can of worms. You're gonna learn today"" I grab the flashlight and set it to its absolute max 14,000 lumen brightness setting. The flashlight has a sensor in it to automatically dim the light if facing down on a table, because otherwise the diodes would get so hot they would melt the lense.The 14,000 lumen setting is so intense, the 57 watt-hour battery can only hold it for 180 seconds before the flashlight automatically notches down to a measly 9,500 lumens. During those 180 seconds, the light will burn through 15% of it's battery power. For reference on just how bright this is, the literal effing sun emits a luminosity of 11,000 lumens per square foot on a bright and clear day. I turn around and aim it straight out the back of my rear window. My car is pretty noisy, so before i turn it on, I rev up my engine to make sure captain smoothbrain is eyes forward when I violate his retinas with the full force of an afternoon sun. I hit the power button and can only imagine the freight train of shock and pain that plowed over this man. It was so bright, his automatic headlights shut off because the car thought it was daytime. With the light on, i could see him clear as glass through his tinted windshield, he was covering his eyes and looking down. Probably screaming. I watched him try and flip down his sun visor, but his hand couldn't find it, as i thought to myself ""Burn you mothereffer....burn"". I imagine my facial expression was similar to that of a 6 year old roasting insects with a magifying glass on a bright summer day. After about 5 seconds of blinding light, i took mercy and shut it off. He proceeded to back way the hell off, and move over to a different lane. Was this an unsafe thing for me to do? Absolutely. Was this illegal? Almost certainly. Was it warranted? Without question. Possibly the highlight of my year Drive safe, and dont be an ass to the car in front of you. Because they might just have the tools to teach you a lesson."
"  neighborly revenge: After enduring ongoing harassment, the protagonist discreetly unleashes a Japanese beetle invasion on their neighbor's prized rose garden.","I got revenge on my neighbor, and he still has no idea I even did anything to him.

My neighbor from a couple of doors down and I had a long running feud. It all started when his dog came in to my backyard, and my dog attacked it. I was nearby, and able to call my dog off before it got serious, but the other dog had a couple of bite wounds. The neighbor wanted me to pay the vet bill. When he threatened me with a lawsuit, I offered to pay half, even though I owed him nothing; it was his dog that was off the leash and in my yard, after all. He declined the offer, took me to small claims court, and lost. The trial lasted all of 3 minutes when the judge found in my favor. That set in to motion him starting to eff with me on a regular basis. My garbage cans would get knocked over every trash day. He would honk his horn and flip me off if he drove by my house. He tried to get my 10 year old son arrested for riding another neighbors mini bike (never called the cops on their kids, just mine.) It was all stupid petty crap. But it was a lot of stupid petty crap, and we were growing frustrated and mildly concerned what he might do. We eventually grew tired of it, and filed a restraining order against him. We dropped the legal case against him when we recieved a letter from his lawyer stating that he would refrain from any sort of contact with any of my family for a period of 2 years. Things settled down at that point. But I was not yet satisfied. I had been staying on the high road through all of this, not responding to any of his bullshittery in any way. I had a desire to get revenge, but never acted on it. Then one day, I hatched my plan of evil genius. I was in the hardware store and I noticed some Japanese Beetle traps. These traps are just a plastic bag with a scent pack; the beetles are drawn to the scent, fall in the bag, and can't get out. They also sold refill packages of the scent packs only, 4 per package. My neighbor has a very large rose garden in his front lawn. It is his pride and joy. Japanese beetles love roses. So I bought 4 packages of the refill packs. The scent pack is a waxy substance in a shallow plastic cup. I put the packs in the freezer overnight, to allow me to pull the wax out easily. The next morning, I woke up at 3am. I popped the wax squares out of their cups, and put them in a baggie. Then I crept over to my neighbors house and spread the wax squares in the mulch under his rose garden, covering them from view with a bit of the hardwood mulch. That day was a hot one. By 11am it was north of 90 degrees F. I figured the wax had probably melted in to the dark mulch. Also by 11AM, the Japanese beetles were starting to arrive at my neighbors roses. I went on a bike ride later in the evening, and could see a small swarm of them attacking the roses. My neighbor had not yet noticed what was happening. By noon the next day, there was a freaking cloud of them. There had to be hundreds, if not thousands. My neighbor noticed. That afternoon, I could see him spraying them and spreading Sevin powder and waving his arms in the air in frustration. By the third day, there were thousands of the beetles, if not tens of thousands. They were everywhere in his front lawn and wreaking havoc on his roses. By the end 4th day, there was nothing left of his rose garden, other than a few tattered leaves and the thorny stalks. Those damned scent packs must have drawn every Japanese beetle in for miles around. I had never seen so many in a single place. And that was it. The deed was done, and I was satisfied and laughing...quietly to myself, but laughing and laughing. And I never told a soul what I did, not even my wife. This was a few years ago, and his rose garden is fully recovered now. And it will stay beautiful so long as he keeps being a quiet neighbor."
  a deceptive lover gets her comeuppance: Betraying her partner and boasting about it leads to deportation and a terror watchlist entry.,"Cheat on me and brag to your friends? Enjoy Deportation 

I met this girl(22 at the time) while I(30m at the time) was working in a national park, and she was a housekeeper on a work visa. We instantly hit it off, and within a month we were in a relationship. We even had a solid long-distance arrangement, where we would visit each other on recreational visas in our respective off seasons - I'd spend a few months in Romania or meet her at some vacation destination, then she'd spend a few months in the states. This went on for about two years, and eventually the conversation came up with her family about possibly moving her to the states permanently - Romania never really recovered from the Ceausescu regime, and political/economic corruption makes life pretty unpleasant for a lot of people. Her marrying and moving to the US meant that her mom wouldn't have to worry about her daughter having a good life. I arranged for sponsorship, and proposed to her. It seemed like my dreams were coming true. Then, about a month after she's all settled in, I get a message from her best friend back home - what followed were a year's worth of screenshots wherein she bragged about conning me into paying for her residency, while she cheated on me with 8 different men. In her friend's words, ""You are a good man and you don't deserve this"". So, over the following two weeks, I reported her to ICE and homeland security for a conversation her brother and I had over a bottle at one point - he bragged about how he had done time in prison for smuggling weapons to Turkish terrorists, and how she had been his lookout on several occasions. As you might imagine in the ""War on Terror"" days, this was not taken lightly. She was immediately arrested and deported, and put on a permanent no-entry terror watchlist.

"  spouse plots with lawyer, exposes wife's affair with counselor, leading to professional and financial consequences for them both.","My lawyer and I laid a trap for my adulterous alcoholic wife in my divorce.

When I got divorced -- my alcoholic wife of 18 years had started another affair, this time with her addictions counselor -- my lawyer and I laid a trap for them. Just in case you don't know, intimate relations between a counselor and patient are very frowned upon by the regulatory bodies. And I was more than pissed after putting her through rehab ($25k which I didn't have to do) only to have her fall back into her old behavior. Shortly before the divorce was finalized I filed a complaint with the State body licensing health professions. Knowing they were in some peril because of their unprofessional relationship ( I had already gotten him fired from a major teaching hospital), she had backed off her exorbitant demands. I paid her a very modest settlement, kept the house, got custody of the three tweenage kids, plus got child support. Her lawyer naturally included a clause in the divorce where I had to agree to not say anything negative about her lover and their relationship. But the lawyer effed up and never asked if I had already filed charges and thus didn't require me to rescind them. Her lawyer had assumed I was just bad mouthing them to neighbors and friends, and it never occurred to the lawyer that we were doing much more. When the Board of Health Professions responded to my complaint shortly after the divorce was finalized I told them that it would take a subpoena to get me to testify (a subpoena trumps an agreement in a divorce settlement). They were happy to oblige. They stripped his license, and placed him on a register of sanctioned health professionals. He never worked again. They were broke in a handful of years and she divorced him when the money ran out (in the interim his mother had died leaving a fair sized estate, so it took longer than I expected). Oh, and the frosting on the cake was that his wife and I traded notes (notably hotel receipts from the time of their affair) that helped each of us in our respective divorces. Justice was served."
"  counterfeit money during a pizza delivery escalated to multiple arrests, charges, expulsion from university, and significant legal consequences.","Dude ruined his entire life over 30 dollars

Years ago (roughly 2010) when I was doing Pizza Delivery, I delivered on campus. Pretty standard procedure, call the customer and wait in the parking lot.
Buddy comes down, hands me money, takes the pizza and walks away. Then he starts to run. I look in my hand, and one of the $10 bills is ripped in half, and the $20 is horribly counterfeit. Dudes already back in his dorm, and it's pass activated, so I can't even get in. Then I remembered I have his number in my phone from when I called him.
So I call the store, tell them what happened, and they mark his number as a prank caller, so no more deliveries. Figured eh, that's good enough I guess.
Then as I was leaving, I saw campus security, talking to a police member. (There was a check stop just before the entrance to the grounds.)
I stop and walk up and give them the rundown of what happened, give the counterfeit bill and the ripped bill to the officer, while the campus security dude is looking up the phone number in the student directory. Campus security finds out who it is, and off they go.
10 minutes later, buddy is in the back of a police car with his dorm mate for:
Theft Under $1000 (because technically he didn't pay for the pizza)
Possession of counterfeit currency (he had more in his dorm)
Possession of narcotics
Possession of a controlled substance (Addy's and xanny's I believe)
Possession with intent to sell
Possession of stolen property
And there was another charge but I can't remember.
I guess he posted bail a couple days later and came down to the pizza shop to have ""some words"" with me, but I wasn't working that night, so buddy started trashing the lobby and got arrested again for:
Trespassing
Criminal Mischief
Vandalism 
And they found a knife on him as well when they searched him, so there was a weapons charge too, but I think that got dropped.
I'm not sure what happened after the second arrest, as I was never called to testify in court, but I'm going to assume he took a plea deal. He most definitely got expelled from the university though."
"  son cheated on pregnant wife. Narrator plans to tell wife despite son's pleas, potentially causing family damage. Seeking advice.","My Son Cheated On His Wife and He Has No Idea What I’m Going To Do.

My son [28M] has been married to his high-school sweetheart Olivia [26F] (fake name) for 5 years now. two weeks ago was my son's birthday, he went out of state with some of his community college friends to spend time at a resort. Olivia had chosen to stay in-state as she is heavily pregnant with twins and high risk [7 months]. I told my son to cancel the trip and stay with his wife, but she insisted they go have fun. So, I insisted she stay with me so she can stay in bed and she accepted with some pushing. Now, I love Olivia. she is sweet, respectful, and like a daughter to me. Her own parents were not great, so we bonded easily as she dated my son. We talk daily and see each other often.
After my son got home from his trip, I could tell something was off. he wouldn't accept any drinks I offered him, refused to kiss Olivia instead giving awkward hugs, and was overall incredibly cautious. I asked him over and over why he's acting so strange but he beat around my questions and went home with Olivia. Throughout the following week Olivia would tell me more of my son's odd behavior. He moved into the guest bedroom, refused to eat any of her meals, refused any kind of intimacy, etc. Whenever I spoke to my son about it I got one word awnsers or he would ignore the topic completely.
this week he came to my home in tears, clutching a folder filled with visibly crumpled papers. After calming him down he told me that on his birthday trip his college friends hooked him up with multiple ""workers"". he never used protection with any of them and didn't think anything of it until he started burning. apparently he contracted 2 ""STIs"" [Gonorrhea and HPV]. I was blunt in why he was telling me and not his wife pregnant with twins. That's when he begged me not to tell her about his affairs and to let him stay with me while he treated his infections.
I flat out told him NO and that if he wasn't going to tell his wife, I will. He then got angry, shouting and crying saying how I'm going to rip his family apart before it's even started because I refuse to let him have any fun. he accused me of favoring Oliva and wanting to separate him from his children as I did to his own father. (This was not true and another story). I had to call on my neighbor whom I am close witn to help escort my son out of my home. edit: I did find the papers he brought and they were not medical results but instead bank statements.
I'm thinking about how this will hurt Olivia and possibly her twins by telling her and maybe my son is right, so please help me find a way to do this with minimal damage to my dear family."
"  a daughter wants her biological father at wedding, but mother refuses due to past assault, causing tension and disagreement.




","I  told my daughter that I won't attend her wedding if her biological father is there but now she says that I'm being stuck in the past.

I would appreciate some advice on the current situation I find myself in and I am hoping an outsider's viewpoint can offer me some clarity.
For some context, about 24 years ago, I was sa’d by a 'close friend' of mine and got pregnant by the encounter. I was inconsolable for months after the event. To make matters worse, I found out I was pregnant at about 20 weeks and where I lived at the time, it was illegal to get an abortion after the first trimester.
My husband had really been my rock and my support during that time and I do not know how I would have ended up if not for him. He said that I could put it up for adoption or I could keep the child and he would raise it like our other children. I decided to not give it up for adoption but raising the kid was hard. I am half Polish and half German and he is half German and half Russian. We both have pale skin, light hair and blue eyes, as well as being fairly tall (I'm about 178 cm or around 5'10 and he is 191 cm or about 6'3). However, our daughter Luna is about 160 cm or 5'3, has dark hair and a brown complexion like her biological father.
I often heard snide remarks about me being an unfaithful wife because it was obvious that she was not my husband's child. It was especially hard for me when Luna was young because she looked so much like her dad. My husband took care of my daughter most of the time since I had bad flashbacks whenever I saw her face from when I was assaulted. As she grew up, it died down a bit, but I would still get these horrible panic attacks when I saw her wearing boys' clothes and short hair.
Since I was prone to having panic attacks, Luna ended up being closer to my husband than she was to me. Also, she often ended up getting a little more than her siblings from my husband as some sort of compensation because of me. We never told her that she was the product of s a because I was too ashamed and my husband did not want her feeling different from her siblings. I often told her that me and her biological father got into an altercation and never spoke to one another ever again.
About 2 years ago, she got one of those DNA test items and found out she had a relative in the system. Said relative got Luna in touch with her bio dad and they started talking despite my protests. He apparently wanted to speak to me about something he wanted to tell me, so Luna attempted to persuade me to speak with him. I made her aware that me and her father shouldn't ever be in the same room together.
Now, Luna is getting married to a lovely young man. Some of the COVID restrictions have been lifted so she is able to have a decent-sized wedding. The original plan was to have my husband walk her down the aisle but he had gotten into a bad accident leaving him in a wheelchair until his legs are strong enough to support his weight again. However, this is not her idea of a picture-perfect wedding day so she invited her biological father to have the honour of being the bride's father. Her wedding invitation not only invited my assaulter, but she totally disrespected the man who raised her. Although I or a bridesmaid could have pushed him down the aisle, she thinks it would not fit the 'vibe' of the wedding.
My husband looked so shocked and upset that she would even think of this but I was furious. I have a visceral hate for that man and I let her know that I would not be anywhere near him. She told me that this is what she wants and there's no changing her mind so I told her I will not be attending if he's there. She got upset and told me that I shouldn't hang onto the past but I laid it into her that she doesn't know what happened between me and her biological father so she shouldn't stick her nose where it doesn't belong. Though I feel terrible about what I said and how I said it and I can't be blamed for her being born or not knowing what happened since I never told her, I still feel as though my wishes should be respected if I say I don't want to be in the same room as someone.\. I'm now okay with her contacting her father I just do not want anything to do with him. Also, it's rude to replace your father with another man who you've barely known for two years because of something he couldn't control.
Can anyone offer me a perspective that I am not catching? Has anyone ever dealt with this and if so how?"
"  how dating a wealthy girl brought challenges but also sweet gestures. Adjusting to different financial lifestyles, sharing expenses, and thoughtful gifts.","Men of TikTok, what are the struggles of dating a very rich girl?

I was never sure how rich she was. I just knew her family had property in a couple places in the US and China. And this is also how I found out property in China is dumb expensive. When she went for the holidays, if she wanted to say, stay in Shanghai and then go to Beijing later, she didn’t have to look at hotels or Airbnb, she just had to make sure she grabbed the right set of keys. It was weird. She wasn’t dripping with designer clothes and drove a fuel efficient compact but just looking at where her family had apartment/houses, I can only imagine.
She was a super sweet, down to earth girl. Biggest heart in the world, very hard working, and acted like a child in a candy shop everywhere she went. I think the biggest strain came when we would eat together. For me, money was tight and the best way to stretch my college scholarship money was to cook meals in bulk. Before she met me, she ate out literally every single meal.
At first, it took some adjusting and rebudgeting. Bless her heart, she understood and found compromises. She loved my cooking and would surprise me with groceries and then say I have to pay her back by cooking whatever she wanted. Every once awhile she’d pick up the entirety of a bill that we were supposed to split but she always found a way to make sure I didn’t feel down about it. I don’t think she ever once bought me an expensive gift. Most things were either hand made or were very thoughtful for example shoes I’d been eying for months but couldn’t afford and she noticed them my computer browser."
"  how if screws were removed overnight, chaos would ensue as buildings collapse, appliances fail, transportation halts, and everyday tasks become impossible.","What one item, if removed overnight completely, would cause the most chaos among society?

Screws. I cannot believe this isn't higher up. Literally EVERYTHING would fall apart. Homes (both standard wooden suburban models and fancy high rise condos) would collapse. Your appliances are no more. Power lines drop (probably electrocuting a shitload of people in the process, or starting fires). You can't drive to work because your car is held together with this shit. So you walk. Except you can't wear your glasses because they have teeny screws too. As a result, you can't see, so you get lost on your walk. You try to get close to a street sign so you can read it, but instead you trip over it because the sign is now on the ground. You eventually get to your shitty restaurant job, but can't clock in because computers are held together with SCREWS, the cash register is held together with SCREWS, and even the menu that hangs above the counter is held together with MOTHERFUCKING SCREWS. In addition to basic order-taking needs not being met, the fryer has also completely come apart, dumping gallons and gallons of dirty oil on the floor. Cool. You're not cleaning that up, so you quit your job. You pull out your phone. But it doesn't work, because the cell towers are all on the ground. So you get a newspaper, find a job listing, and go there. The elevator doesn't work. No one can interview you because there are no lights, there's no power. The secretaries are running around with candles desperately trying to hold things together with duct tape and pins. You leave. You try to take the bus home, think again. You pass a grocery store (collapsed) and think you'll grab some spaghetti to cook at home. Can't be that bad, right? Cook it over a fire, you'll learn to exist in this new screw-free world. Fuck, you may even THRIVE! You take it home, but all of your pots have no handles because...wait for it...screws. So you give up. You're tired, unemployed, hungry, with sore feet from all the walking. You don't even have a roof over your head because your home collapsed. You're desolate. You won't survive this screwpocalypse. You decide to take your own life. The easy way out. The only easy thing you've done this far. You grab your pocketknife to slit your wrists, you're about to whip it out when GODDAMNIT THE BLADE FUCKING FELL OUT BECAUSE IT WAS HELD TOGETHER WITH A MOTHERFUCKING SCREW."
  guy found happiness and satisfaction by moving on from his cheating ex-girlfriend and discovering a better match in Germany.,"What Is The Best Revenge To A Cheating Partner 

An ex girlfriend about 10 years ago emailed me to say it wasn't working out and that she had met the
unconditional love of her life, something she told me I was. So, needless to say, I was a bit hurt, but not much I could do about it. I chewed on it for a while and got really pissed off the more I thought about it.
I eventually moved on with life, and basically forgot about her entirely, like pushed so far out of my mind and memories that I legit never thought about her at all. I ended up running into her several years afterwards working at a hotel reception desk and straight up didn't even notice her. She was acting a little bitchy and I didn't know why and chalked it up to her having a rough day or something. Got my key and got settled in my room. The next morning I was coming out to get ready to head to work and was in the lounge area where they have the waffles and stuff and she taps me on the shoulder, I assume she worked all night, and proceeds to challenge me. And I'm like
""whoa, whoa, whoa! If I did something to offend you, I'm so sorry, but who the fuck are you?""
And then she said 
""I'm so glad I married and not you, you're such a piece of doodoo."" And then i was like
 ""Oh!"" 
as the light finally came on. She looked like she was very miserable, and that made me very, very, very happy. She was a real tool. Looking back on it, I am kind of proud of myself that I managed to completely move on with my life that I didn't even remember what she looked like. I am amazed that she expected me to dwell on her as if she was the greatest thing that ever happened to me and that I lost her, like it seems she almost expected me to dwell on it for YEARS and be depressed about it. As if that wasn't enough, I met a woman in Germany who is like the female version of me. It's pretty awesome. Funny how life works out when you just go with the flow."

When my deaf/autistic son was in kindergarten I got a phone call from his teacher while I was at work. She was laughing and said she absolutely had to call me and tell me what happened immediately. My son was sitting beside another boy on the floor stacking blocks. Another boy came up and pushed my son. My son made no response and didn't even look at him. The boy sitting beside him said, ""I wouldn't do that if I were you."" The bully pushed my son again, and again got no response. The seated boy again said, ""I wouldn't do that."" The bully then bent down and scattered my son's blocks. My son calmly stood up, took one big swing, and punched the bully, sending him sprawling across the floor. My son immediately sat back down without a sound and started stacking blocks again as if nothing had happened. The seated boy turned to the bully and said, ""See? I told you so."" The teacher on the phone said she and my son's aide were laughing uncontrollably after witnessing this. Normally a child would get in trouble for punching another kid, but the simplicity and economy of motion were stunning. They said they had never seen anything like it."
"  family searches for missing brother, discovers he traveled abroad, held unconventional beliefs, and eventually reconciles after years of separation.","People who have gone missing but were found. What happened?

People who have gone missing but were found. What happened? My brother moved to Hawaii and from there Iceland. One day we stopped hearing from him, like he vanished off the face of the Earth. He had stopped posting on social media, he had stopped contacting all his friends. It was always a possibility that he was going off the grid for some reason, but last we spoke everything was fine and normal. Still, we thought he would pop up somewhere, as he was an extensive world traveler and often went incommunicado for periods of time. A year goes by, we are more worried. What if something happened to him? Why wouldn't he be on social media anymore? Why would he cut contact with his entire network of friends and family? He had never done that before. There was no fight or drama. The last conversation he had with my mom was about Christmas presents. We start looking for him. We message everyone we know he knows. We message his best friend, who gives a very cryptic response neither denying or confirming anything. This gets us worried, why is this guy being shady? Last we knew these two were travelling the world together. My mom email bombs his best friend, who refuses to respond. We wait another year. Nothing. We are starting to think he might be dead. My mom files a missing persons report, and the police find no trace of him. I start posting missing persons reports. We scour the internet. We find nothing. Another year. I haven't seen him in 5 years now. I think I’ll never see him again. Half my family is convinced he died somewhere abroad. My mom hires a private detective for 10K. The guy can't find much, he is worthless. I started posting on Scandinavian subreddits, because that was the region my brother was last seen in. I basically make a missing persons poster with his picture and all his info. A week later someone sends me a message, they had seen my brother! We are freaking out. The person explains that he was in Norway, and had worked with my brother doing construction. This Gentleman was from Michigan, but owned a business in Norway, so could kind of weed out the bullcrap in my brother’s story. My brother was telling people that he was adopted and that his family had stolen him as a baby. He said my brother seemed kind of mentally off, with a lot of conspiracy theories and rambling thoughts. I thanked this guy profusely. It was so nice to know my brother was alive. Still, this isn't proof positive. There is no picture of my brother, and by the time this guy messaged us my brother had moved on. Reddit dude told us where my brother had said he was going next. We contacted our local police with this new info. They messaged the police force in Uppsala, where my brother had said he was going. The police there know where he is! They go to his door and let him know his family is looking for him. He tells them he knows, and doesn't want to talk to us. They check his passport to make sure he is actually my brother. This is the best and worst news we have had. It was now 7 years since we had talked to him at all. A couple months later my brother sends me a Facebook message! He hasn't directly contacted me in almost 8 years. He wants me to remove my post about him being missing, it was showing up when you Google searched his name. I say I will and try and start a conversation with him. Slowly we started talking again. He agrees to be taken to the rest of the family. We keep in contact for the next 2 years and I go visit him in Sweden. The year after that he moved home."
"  son wants dad to understand wife isn't his mom, stop forcing a relationship. Wife struggles to support emotionally. Cut contact preferred.","How do I get my dad to realise his wife is not my mom and to quit pressing a relationship?

How do I get my dad to realise his wife is not my mom and to quit pressing a relationship? My mom passed away when I was 14. I was always closer with her than my dad, so I took it very hard and still missed her every day. My dad moved on extremely quickly. I'm talking about 1 and a half months later, and he was openly dating his current wife and I suspect he was cheating on my mom. She moved in 4 months after my mom's death. Then, 9 months after her death, they announced their engagement on my birthday as one of my gifts. I obviously didn't take it well. Made a scene and dumped the cake they got me and walked out. I disappeared for a few days until they were about to put out a missing persons report. I was forced to go back. They tried to get rid of all evidence of my mom such as pictures and files. I kept what I could and hid some others. They wouldn't let me celebrate her birthday or anything to do with my mom. They tried to force me to call her mom. I never did. They would ignore me when I called her by her name. She would introduce herself as my mom. I would correct her every time. It got to the point that I stopped talking to her unless absolutely necessary or if I was correcting her. These talks were usually one word answers. My dad got angry every time I didn't call her mom, use her first name, or introduce her as my dad’s wife. I once spent 2 weeks not talking to either of them when I was 16 because I was ruining their family dynamic. They caved at about the 15th day of no communication. I turned 18 and left for uni and went extremely low contact and didn't go back. When I was 21, I got engaged to my fiancé. She knows about my relationship with my dad and his wife. She respects it and is on my side. When they found out my dad and his wife had a fit. They didn't know I was seeing anyone. My dad's wife posted on social media saying she was excited that her son was getting married with a bunch of other things, saying she can't wait until she becomes a grandma. I made a short post saying I am not and never was her son, and she won't be a grandma to any future kids. My dad got mad saying I was disrespecting my mother and embarrassed her. I asked who we were talking about because my only mother was my real one, and at this point, I lost both of my parents on that day when I was 14. That was 3 years ago, and we went back to low contact. But my wife is about 8 months pregnant. They showed up to my house even though I never gave them my address. They wanted to talk and meet my wife. I didn't let them in and said to turn around and go back to where they came from. But apparently, they decided they wanted to move to my state to be closer and repair the relationship between us. She said she missed her son and wanted to be a better mom and grandma. I called them delusional and told them to leave and slammed the door. They bought a house about 5 minutes away from us. This has all been way too much for me, and my therapist wants me to let them in, but I would rather cut all contact. It wouldn't be so bad if they just would stop trying to replace my mom and act like she never existed. I honestly don't know much about my dad's wife. I don't even know if I know who my dad is anymore. My wife is struggling to support me emotionally and doesn't know how to help."
"  individual confesses to stalking, breaking into the girl's house, and collecting personal items to satisfy their unhealthy obsession.","What was the nastiest thing you have ever done?

What was the nastiest thing you have ever done? I used to attend a gym and quickly developed a crush on a beautiful girl. We’re going to call this girl L. This girl was fairly tall, had fair skin, beautiful curly blonde hair, and had the best figure in the gym. She was always playful and had a vibrant personality. Every guy tried to talk to her but they were all rejected. I tried making small talk but it never went any further than a simple hello. This was around the time I began fantasising about stalkers. A few months into obsessing over her I could not take it. I went online and found some sketchy websites, other stalkers talking about their experiences. I went on to ask them questions about how to go about it, how to make sure you don’t get spotted. I went all out. Little by little I found out information about her, about where she lives, where she studies, what she studies, her hobbies outside the gym, and the more I knew the more I loved. I found out about her little quirks, her hobbies. I would stay up all night browsing her social media trying to figure out where she would be, I would watch her as she entered the gym and would make sure to be there when she leaves too. Eventually I found out that she was going on holiday in Paris with her mother. From my discoveries, I found out her dad left and their house was vacant. The night they left, I broke in. I picked the lock. Luckily for me, there were no security alarms. I snooped through her room, found her clothes, her unwashed ones too and stashed them to use for my own pleasure. I left. I came back the next day, and the day after, collecting more items. I would use her toothbrush and imitate being her. I wanted her more than life itself. I even succumbed to the urge of licking the ends of her adult toys. I would go through her bins, I found used tissues and admired them. They looked so divine. I found her nail polish and daydreamed about how pretty she looks getting a manicure and pedicure. I could not hold it anymore. I sat on her bed and rubbed one out there and then, but not before lightly staining the bed sheets with my fluids. I realised I had messed up and used my best to clean it out. I was able to do so successfully. I kept doing this until the day they returned, to my great disappointment, when I came by on night number 6, the car was there. I decided I had done enough damage and never went back, but I still keep all the items I took, they are my prized possessions. I see her in the gym, doing her exercises, completely unaware of me, and that brings me joy, as I can love her from a distance, and that is enough for me."

I agree a price that means I'll stick around until breakfast and he asks me to meet him at a restaurant I knew. When I meet him in person, I couldn't believe my eyes; this guy was gorgeous, and I mean paid model pretty. I couldn't understand why he contacted me, the man had three stunning women eyeing him up as soon as he entered the room. Still, he was nice and sweet, although clearly incredibly nervous, so we sat and drank and talked, ate our food and generally had a pleasant evening. He took a while to open up, so I did most of the small talk to start with, but he soon opened up, and seemed like a real, genuine nice guy. Still baffled as to why this guy needed to hire a worker, the meal came to an end and he started to close up again; I started to think he had his V card who was super nervous. I called a cab to take us back to his place. When we got through the door, he rushed to the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of booze and just started chugging. I took the bottle off him and tried to get him to relax, told him to take a breath, put on some music and to meet me in the bedroom. Eventually he walked in, eyes turned to the floor. I sat him on the edge of the bed, unzipped his trousers. He was limp. I looked up at him to say something, and realised he was breathing heavily because he was trying to hold back tears, which wasn't working because they were rolling down his cheeks. He burst into tears and started sobbing uncontrollably. Turns out he was gay. He had tried coming out to his parents, and apparently his mum basically carried on like he hadn't said anything, but his dad just kept laughing. saying it was a phase, he would get over it. When he tried to convince his dad the feelings were real, his dad made him phone me. We sat and talked for hours, about he had never been able to tell anyone about his interests, and that his parents had been the first people he confided in. He hadn't got many friends because he was worried about being bullied, and he had always known he was gay so he had never had a girlfriend. I just cuddled him while he talked, not saying a word. When I left in the morning he tried to give me money, but I left it on his counter after he got in the shower. I wanted to text him later, to see if he ever sorted things out with his parents, but at the time I felt like he might think I was weird because I wasn't his friend, I was a call girl. A few weeks later I saw his picture on the local news, and my blood ran cold because I knew the instant I saw it what had happened.

My mum and dad divorced when I was 4 and my mum verbally abused my dad on the regular, he always took it, never said a bad word about her, ever. He was a big guy, strong, immovable and quiet; he would just hug myself and my brother and the world would put itself to rights. That kind of dad. We would see him at the weekends early on, this would change as my mum became more vindictive but for the first few years this was the status-quo. I remember playing doom with him, just sitting in his lap thinking this was the coolest thing ever, then we would go to blockbuster get a movie and a takeaway and chill on the sofa. Myself and my brother always ended up sitting on the floor by my dads feet just to be a little closer to the action. Anyway it was a usual weekend, bike ride, TV and some wrestling on the sofa. My dad had already rented the movie so we didn't know what it was, turned out it was Mrs. Doubtfire. Ok so we made it through most of the film without incident, then it came to the scene in the courtroom where robin williams begs for his kids, literally begs just to be in their life, watch them grow, be their father. My dad gets up and goes to the toilet, I assume. For a few minutes I didn't notice, there were sounds coming from the kitchen, inconsistent breaths and pacing. I walked into the kitchen to my dad gripping both sides of the fridge, his forehead touching the cold metal; and he was just shuddering a full body shudder while tears fell freely. I didn't know what to do, I started to cry as well, I was only eight and I didn't understand , I couldn't understand and it scared me. I just whispered 'dad?' His head whipped around and I thought for sure he was angry but he just dropped to his knees and held me. He called for my brother and squished us together, he was still shaking, it was so powerful. He held onto us like we were the only things rooted to the ground, like he was scared we would disappear . After a minute he got up and held onto the fridge again, he opened it, pulled out some ice cream, smiled and said 'come on' as he walked to the sofa. That is one of only two times I ever saw my dad cry. It was the day I realized he wasn't made of stone and metal, he wouldn't fly, and he couldn't save the world. He was just a man who loved his kids and couldn't bare to see them go."

My Girlfriend Just Broke up With Me Because of Her Friends. I have been with my girlfriend Kate exclusively for 5 years but on and off for 2 years before. A lot of my first times happened with her. We went to each other's prom and school dances. We supported each other through tough times. I know she is out of my league but I love her and want to make her feel secure. I want a future with her. We were planning to move in with each other in a few months and talked about marriage and children. For the last couple of months, she kept making comments like ""my coworkers keep asking why I'm with you."" ""She thinks that you're not in my league."" ""My coworkers want me to hang out with them and meet new people."" Every time I would ask Kate what she thought. She always said that she loves me and ignores the comments. Tells them to stop. But they kept saying these comments made by her coworkers. We always had open communication. Talked things out. We haven't had any major issues. We argue over little things such as movies and TV shows, food. We don't hide anything. These comments started when she got the job at that salon. She works with all women. She did not cheat or anything. No emotional affairs. No hiding locations. No secret social media. The other night we had a nice date. Had a good after date. When I dropped her off at her place she commented that she was having doubts about our relationship and wanted to break up. I was super confused and didn't say anything. I slowly walked away. I know it was because of her coworkers. The comments they were making and pushing her to leave me. Less than 4 hours later she started calling me and texting me saying she was sorry, didn't mean it, that she loves me, and she was stupid for what she said and listening to her new friends. She was going to quit and find a different job. Stop talking to her coworkers. I have not responded to anyone. I'm conflicted. I love her. I have a ring being made for her. Money saved for a house for both of us. We share 85% of our friend groups. The rest are from our jobs. Most of our shared friends have now heard about the breakup and seem just as confused as I am. From some of the messages I have received, it looks like she told them the truth. That her coworkers started to give her insecurities about our relationship and she stupidly went with it. Her parents tried to reach out to me asking what happened. I have been radio silent. Luckily I can work remotely. I left my apartment yesterday with my laptop and found a nice place with good internet to still do my job. "
"  patient's traumatic disclosure: Found her aunt's lifeless body in a closet amidst her parents' volatile relationship, leading to her aunt's death.","Therapists, what’s the most disturbing thing a patient has disclosed to you?

My patient's parents were having problems, and they shouted at each other almost every night. One evening, when my patient was eleven, she came home to find that everything was normal. Everything. No shouting, no throwing things, no nothing. She had a feeling that something was wrong, but dismissed it and walked to her room. A few hours had passed and still, nothing had happened. Her parents were sitting in the living room, not talking. Then she realised that her aunt was missing. Alarm shot through her as she remembered that almost every single one of their fights were about her. Immediately, she sprinted through the door of her room and instinctively went to her parents room. She got in, not even caring if her parents heard her, and shouted her aunt's name. Nothing. No answer. She knew she didn't have much time before her parents came running upstairs, so she quickly went to hide in the closet. To her surprise, there were no clothes, and it stunk really bad. She took out her phone and shone a flashlight around. She looked in dismay as she saw her aunt, limp, vomit dripping from her mouth. She almost vomited herself in disgust. She could hear her parents looking for her in their room. She started feeling terrified. The minute she heard them leave and close the door behind them, with a key, she left the closet slowly, careful not to make any sound, and dragged her aunt to the window (her aunt was very young, much younger than her mum, so she wasn't all that heavy) and threw her outside. She then jumped (the window wasn't very far from the ground). They lived right next to a forest, so she landed in a bush. She started dragging her aunt and trying to run as far as she could. When she was a few metres away, she fell on the ground, exhausted. Then, for the first time, she looked back at her aunt. Her heart dropped. Her aunt wasn't breathing, and she had no heartbeat. She was dead."
"  pranking narcoleptic friend backfires as he's left undressed in sister's bed, resulting in an embarrassing and messy situation.","TIFU by pranking a narcoleptic

Growing up we had a friend we called Bert. He was a big lanky and skinny dude, pale as a ghost due to his low blood pressure, prone to bouts of narcolepsy. Bert wasn't his real name, just a nickname that had stuck because he would foam at the mouth during his narcoleptic spells. In other words, he was a fantastic source of entertainment for our idiot troupe, and pranking Bert became part of our weekend routine. He would drift to sleep during the slightest lull in action, sitting still more than ten minutes, basically. The only way he could stay awake was by keeping occupied, so he would walk around a lot, or keep himself busy eating. When he slept he had two modes: he would either nod off and jerk back into consciousness a split second later  or he would be out cold for maybe five minutes (perfect for pranking). You could tell he was out cold when he drooled. One day we're playing Fifa 97 at another friend's house. I don't know if you remember Fifa 97 for the PS1 but the loading times were atrocious. After a while we looked over and Bert was slumped into himself, drool pooling in the folds of his coat (he rarely removed his big Manchester United manager's coat). We all agreed that Bert was due a pranking. We knew we could move Bert around while he slept, an arm here, a leg there. But we'd never fully tested the limits of his tolerance. Two of us took an arm each and another guy took his legs and we lifted him from his chair. Sure enough he remained asleep. We swung him back and forth a bit and still he slumbered. We were amazed. So of course we knew the thing to do would be to carry him upstairs to our friend's sister's bedroom. At first we just wanted him to wake up somewhere weird. Then we got weird. Our friend's sister was about four years older than us, something of a hottie, and she worked odd shifts at the local supermarket. We'll call her Jane for the purposes of this retelling, it's close enough. It was mid evening and we didn't know when exactly Jane would be home, which lent a frisson of terror to the process of undressing Bert. After we'd stripped him down to his underwear, we slipped him under Jane's big baby-pink quilt and took his clothes downstairs. This should have been enough for us, but the madness had taken us and we knew we were going to push it as far as we could. We took one of Jane's fragrant girly pillows and put her nightwear on it, then slipped it under Bert's arm. We skulked back downstairs stifling laughter, waiting for Bert to wake and flee from the room in terror. Five minutes passed, then ten. Usually he would be awake by then. Maybe the comfort of the bed had lulled him into a deeper sleep. We went up to check on him, and found him in much the same position as we had left him, except now he had an obvious stiffy that had escaped from the front of his layers and he had just had a very messy dream all over Jane's sheets and pillow. It had darkened an expanding area of her clothes. One of the most grim experiences of my life was trying to mop up Bert's fluids with a bundle of kitchen paper on the end of a pair of barbecue tongs. We tried to wake him but it was no good, and that awful pale thing of his refused to deflate. Apparently he had no blood pressure problems in one specific area. Then we hear keys in the front door and holy crap Jane is home. I'm ashamed to say that I thundered down the stairs and ran out the back door and vaulted over the fence with an athleticism I never knew I had, closely followed by friend number 4, leaving our other friend to deal with Bert, his sister, and everything else."
"  toddler kidnapped by grandmother, taken to Mexico. Mother and father, aided by friends, rescue child after a dramatic confrontation.","What's the worst crime you've been the victim of?

I was kidnapped as a toddler. My mom was a teenager when she had me, and her mom was convinced that she wouldn't be able to care for me. She insisted that my mom allow her to adopt me. My mom, having suffered years of abuse by her mom including being given over to a man with a history of crimes involving the exploitation of children, told her to get lost. Lawyers got involved, C PS got involved. Thankfully C P S saw that my mom was taking excellent care of me and saw my grandmother's extensive file with them, and refused to hand me over. A few weeks later my grandfather, who my mom was still on speaking terms with, asked my mom for permission to take me to the park. My mom agreed on the condition that my grandmother not be there. You can guess what happened. My grandparents immediately took me into Mexico. By the time my mom realised something was wrong we were already across the border. My mom called the police, who immediately told her there was nothing they could do. She called the Tijuana police, who told her that an American baby was not their problem. About two weeks later my mom got a call from her sister's husband, informing her that my grandparents were back in town to get some things from their house and to run errands, so they dropped me off with them. My aunt was on my grandparents side and refused to tell my mom, so her husband snuck out to call. My parents by this point had formed a small group of my dad's friends and were about to leave to kidnap me back, so they all rushed over to my aunt's house instead. The guys broke down the door and held all three of my aunts back until my mom found me in a back bedroom and got me out of there. I know what kind of woman my grandmother was, so I'm terrified to think about what would have happened if my parents hadn't gotten me back."
"  child kidnapped by friendly neighbor, kept in basement for a day. Released next morning. Unspoken understanding of neighbor's loss.","People who have been kidnapped, what was your experience like?

When I was 10, my neighbour kidnapped me. She was this single woman in her 50s who was always super, super nice to me. She was always on her porch, and she'd wave when I came home from school. Anyway, I was walking home from school and she was waving as usual, but this time she was beckoning me over. I went up to her porch and she asked me if I wanted some meatloaf she made. I loved meatloaf and she seemed harmless, so I said yes. I expected her to come outside with a plate or something, but instead she called me in and told me to sit downstairs. I felt weird about it, but I followed her into her basement and sat down on her couch. She brought me a plate of meatloaf and I watched Pokemon 2000 on VHS. She had a freezer with those tube popsicle things too. After I ate, I told her I needed to go home, and she told me my parents called and asked her to keep me while they ran errands. I felt weird about it and suspected she was lying, but I just kinda went along with it. I remember I asked her if I could get my gameboy at one point from my house and she said my parents told me not to let me out of her sight. I remember watching Men In Black and falling asleep. When I woke up, I tried leaving, but the door was locked. She left some banana pudding for me on the table for when I woke up, so I just had that and went back to sleep. She opened the door at like, 5 in the morning, woke me up, and asked me if I wanted to go home. She looked like she had been crying. I told her yes and she let me go. My parents asked me where I was and I just told them I went home with a friend after school. I didn't have a cell phone, so it was pretty normal for me to just be gone for a day. I didn't see my neighbour on her porch the next Monday, so I knocked on her door. She came outside and we talked on the porch about stuff. We never talked about that night, and she probably thought I didn't even realize what happened. She didn't say, but I think she had a kid who passed a couple years prior and wanted to fill the gap."
"  friend in prison shared his struggles. Devastated by family abandonment, he tragically took his own life, witnessed by the narrator.




","Ex prisoners, what did you witness that mentally broke you?

I made a friend early on who was sentenced to life for taking the life of a man that had done things to his niece. He'd been locked up for about 5 or six years when I'd first met him. Talked to him every day for three years and one day he came up to me and said he needs to talk to me about something. We do a lap on the back 40 and he tells me his old lady is leaving him, and isn't bringing his daughter up to come see him anymore. He's actually crying. I didn't know what I could do to help him, so I let him cry and told him to not let it bother him, maybe she'll come around. We go on about our day, and everything seems normal. That night he woke me up crying. I got up to talk to him and he says he doesn’t want to live, and that he's glad I'm up because he doesn't want to be alone. I start hitting the panic button for my cell and screaming for a guard, but no one comes, and I have to watch while he pry’s his mirror off of his wall. He put on his linens and blanket like a big robe and he used his mirror as a tool to do you know what. It was hard to see much because of the blankets and the dark, but I could smell blood. Then he lit his blankets on fire. The CO's got there when the smoke alarm went off, but they were too late. I still have nightmares about it, screaming for him to stop, to just talk it out, but he never does. "
"  special needs janitor, Nailbender, heroically stopped a violent intruder at a rural high school, receiving a standing ovation and commendation.","What was the incident at your school?

At my small town rural American high school there was a maintenance janitor who had special needs but was living and working independently. He was in his 50s and everyone liked him. None of the kids knew his name; everyone just called him ""Nailbender."" During my sophomore year a redneck asswagon threatened one of the few non white students in our school. When a teacher tried to stop him the jerk assaulted the teacher. Eventually the police were called and the kid was taken to jail. The next day the dude's older brother, who had dropped out a few years ago and who now worked in the local car parts factory, showed up at lunchtime with a baseball bat that had a sharpened railroad spike through the head. He entered through a side door near the cafeteria and burst in while everyone was eating. After shouting some nonsense he charged at the principal with the bat raised high. Now keep in mind the older brother was a big dude, probably 6 foot 4 and pushing 300 pounds. His arrival, tirade, and charge happened in a matter of seconds. As such none of the students had time to process what was happening and respond. It's questionable whether any of us even should have done so. Just before Big Brother gets to the staff table, where the principal is sitting, Nailbender, who was 5 foot 6 and rail thin, executes a perfect flying rugby tackle from the side. This knocks the assailant to the ground, hard. Nailbender then stands up and stomps on the wrist of the hand holding the bat, forcing Big Bro to release it. Nailbender kicks the bat away. At that point the shop teacher, the football coach, and a few of the larger students grab hold of Big Bro's limbs and hold him down while another adult called the police. Big Bro is then dragged out of the cafeteria to be arrested. As you can imagine, Nailbender was given a standing ovation by the assembled student body like something out of an '80s movie. The mayor later gave him a commendation. He stayed at the school until he retired in his 70s."
"  job loss, blackout, waking up undressed and soaked in urine, damaged door and foot injury led to undeniable realization of alcoholism.","Alcoholics, when did you realise you have a problem?

I had lost another job due to showing up late. To celebrate being fired I decided it was a good idea to go out with my friend for drinks. It was so cold that day; on the news they were warning people about exposure and frostbite within minutes. I took the train to the north side of Chicago. We made a little journey to our favorite bar and to walk there stopped to get a drink at any bar we walked past. By the time we got there, I was pretty out of it. I blacked out. I only remember arriving there. When I woke up at 9 AM on Tuesday, I was unclothed on my couch. I peed myself. The front door of my apartment was wide open with people walking past on their way to work. When I got up I heard a clank noise. Apparently, I lost my keys and beat my door in. This snapped the door frame into pieces. One of these pieces had a long skinny nail which I had stepped onto. So I had a piece of wood attached to the bottom of my foot. I had no wallet or cell phone. My friend called me and told me he woke up with a massive gash in his head and the blood had fused to his pillow. We found out through the people at the bar and a burrito shop what had happened. Apparently we got wasted and went to a burrito place. I had no money and my friend didn't give me money to buy a burrito. So, I used my cause to smack his head and caused the wound. Not having any money, I walked home through a bad area of the city. I got robbed because they took my wallet, keys, and coat. Apartment building security guard let me in and said I looked really cold. I had no keys so I smashed my way in, took off my clothes, and peed on my couch. I called my dad from the apartment management office. I knew I had a real alcohol problem. It was finally undeniable."
"  a misconception: Afghans were all enemies. The reality: Locals and even some Taliban preferred peaceful coexistence and helped ensure troops' safety.




","Military veterans, what is a misconception about Afghanistan?

My perception that was completely wrong is that all the locals hate you and they want to try and take your life 24 7. As I stated, that is completely wrong and it was the opposite of that. The local Afghan population, and ironically the Taliban, were extremely nice to us. They would rather have us there than the Taliban. Where I was stationed was the dope capital of Afghanistan, I actually believe in the world as well. We were also told that the majority of the Taliban were from this area as well. Because of this a lot of them didn't want to fight in their own backyards. The locals were happy with us because we kept the peace and helped them out as much as we could in a combat environment. We actually brought an economic boost for them as well. The local shop owners loved us because we would always buy monsters, pop, cigarettes, and chips off of them. We would buy food off of other locals on a weekly basis. Oh yeah that's another perception I had that was wrong. Those people can cook. And I mean cook. They had the best chicken and potatoes and made the best bread. As I stated already the Taliban soldiers didn't have a problem with us either. There are many times we would hear that the higher up Taliban leaders would call the local guys and flip out on them because they aren't trying to end us and the local dudes would just be like ""Hey man, we're good! They are good! They aren't doing anything to harm us, we just want to chill! They will be gone sooner or later."" There would even be times that the Taliban were forced to do their job that they would have other local people place the IEDs and make them so obvious, like textbook IED laying so we can see it from a mile away so none of us would get hurt and they can pass it on and say they did their job."
"  candles, a cringe-worthy song, a declaration of love, and an emotional breakdown witnessed by an oblivious roommate—awkward romantic gesture.","What's the cringiest thing someone has ever done that they considered to be romantic?

There was this guy that I was making out with, but I was adamant on not letting it get serious. He was handsome, but he was way too cringy.So one night, he texts me to come up to his dorm, and I'm expecting the usual make out session.When I arrive, he greets me at the door. Candles glittering absolutely everywhere. We weren't even allowed to have candles. He picks me up in a bridegroom pose and whisks me over to his twin bed. All the while, his poor roommate is hunched over his computer in the corner with his headphones on, just pretending that this is all not happening.The guy proceeds to play me a song he wrote on his acoustic guitar and sings to me with tears in his eyes. The singing was terrible too, out of key, guitar was out of tune too. I just kept glancing at the roommate for some intervention, but nah, he wasn't having it. When he finishes, he puffs his chest for courage and confidently declares his love for me. There was a long, cliffhanger of silence before I said, ""I'm sorry, but I don't feel the same."" That was about the time he literally ripped off his button up shirt in some display of brute strength and started banging his head on the wall, sobbing and murmuring to himself about being pathetic. I actually walked over and used my hand as a cushion between his forehead and the wall to get him to stop.Meanwhile, his roommate never acknowledged what was going on around him. Not even once."
"  ER doctor faces a young woman with a tumor mistaken for a fungal infection, revealing advanced cancer requiring hospitalization and surgery.","ER doctors, what's the worst state a person has come in ?

ER doc here. Had a nurse come grab me while I was charting: “Doc, you need to see room 6 right now”. For those of you who don’t work in the ER, when one of the nurses tells you to go see a patient, you run.
I took a few steps towards room 6 and the smell hit me like a truck. I gagged on the spot. I peered through the glass doors of room 6, and noticed a well appearing, young female. Because she looked so well, I knew I could spend an extra minute taking a quick detour to find a handful of alcohol swabs that I promptly opened and shoved in my mask to help quench the smell.
I walk into the room and find this young 30 year old female with her leg inside a trash bag, sitting next to her parents and family. They do not seem phased by the rancid smell, meanwhile I hear one of our veteran ER nurses vomiting in the background. I introduce myself to everyone, and ask what brought the young lady to the ER, and why her leg was in a trash bag.
She starts not by talking, but by simply removing the trash bag. And there I saw it. A monstrous tumour protruding from her tibia. She then proceeds to explain:
It started 6 months ago with a cut that wouldn’t heal. It then changed to appear like a “fungal skin infection”. She googled it, and was confident in the diagnosis. She decided to treat it by starving it of sugar, and going on a sugar free, vegan diet. Eventually she convinced her whole family to do the same in order to “help treat the infection”. And then about a month prior to her visit today, it was too large and painful to even walk around, so she's been living in her room at home taking virtual online 
college courses. She added that she's lost 30 pounds since “the infection began syphoning the nutrients away from my body a few months ago”.
Because it grew and developed so slowly, her family and herself were completely acclimated to the smell and didn’t notice anything. By this point in the conversation, I heard another nurse vomit.
I then sat down and delivered the bad news, that this was not a fungal infection, and likely advanced cancer. That we would be admitting her to the hospital for further workup and surgical resection."
"  a heartbreaking tragedy in school: A beloved girl endured relentless bullying, leading to her untimely death by suicide, leaving lasting impact on classmates.","What was the most messed up thing you saw in school?

These three girls used to pick on my first girlfriend and first love. She was smart and funny and one of the best things about going to school. She didn't tell anyone she was being bullied and it went on for a very long time apparently. They put cigarettes out on her. Put gum in her hair. Demanded money. Tripped her up.
She finally had had enough and wrote to her parents about what she had endured. All of the nasty things these three highschool girls had done to her. She named names and left her diary with more details on their bed. She then went to her parents closet, took her father’s rifle and pulled the trigger. She was 15 years old. She was loved by many of us.
I came to school late. I had missed the assembly about her. I walked into my class to everyone in tears. Her desk had flowers on it. Her best friend told me while in tears. I don't remember much of the rest of that day at school. I took the bus home. I remember that. I ate in silence and went to my room without talking to my parents. I cried. I cried till I slept. I don't think I have cried as hard or long as that night since.
The funeral was hard. The whole school was there and most of our town. Too many things going on for me to properly process. Her parents couldn't get any air so I could barely offer my condolences.
A few other friends within the next year ended their lives as well. One due to grief of losing our friend. I had lost too much. I kept in touch with several of my friends but our circle was never the same.
The three girls and their families left our school after being shunned by our community. I left that school shortly after. I begged my parents to let me change schools. I couldn't walk those halls anymore. Going made me physically ill. I couldn't find the light in those days.
I spent many hours of my early teens leaning on her grave and telling her about my life. How it was going, what had happened. I used to ride my bike an hour each way. I've since made it a point to visit her anytime I've gone back. I've not been back for 15 years but I could walk you there from any gate in the cemetery.
27 years have passed since I've seen her smile but I can still see it. She never got to see the internet, mobile devices or texting. She would have loved google. She loved being right and would scour the library for information on topics she loved."
"  sibling relationship deteriorated due to constant insults, belittlement, disregard for interests, prioritizing himself, and inability to empathize or understand.","What ended your relationship with your sibling?

My brother is older than me by about 5 years. When I was a baby, he apparently played with me all the time. When I got older, he wanted nothing to do with me (what teenage boy would want to deal with their younger sister), so when I got to a teenager, I was like, “fine ignore me”, but of course, he now wanted his little sis. But you see, I wasn't exactly up to his standard.
It seemed like every chance he got, he liked to call me stupid. And not just in the siblings being siblings way. From adult 'conversations' with him, he has it in his head that our mom pushed him to get A's, while I was allowed to get B's. What he doesn't seem to understand is that he has a near photographic memory and him not trying hard got him A's where as me working my ass off, I was lucky to get a B in some classes. School was incredibly hard for me, whereas he skipped a grade. but he doesn't see that, I just had it ""easier"" He later tells me that he was just being ""hard on me"" because nobody else would. Total B S.
Then he insulted everything I enjoyed. ""Why do you like X?"", ""X is for kids, grow up"". He's put down anything that I thought was fun. He'd shit on my few hobbies. Tell me to get out of my ""virtual world"". There's a lot of things I wanted to try as a kid, but my mom being a single mom could only do so much and my brother, of course, signed up for everything and asked permission later. So guess who was dragged around to everything of his. So I had to find things to do on my own while he went and had fun.
And then he insulted my looks. I still consider myself a tomboy. I've always been comfort over fashion (I'm not a slob though). I hate dresses and skirts. I hate the idea of a purse (and I have a very unisex bag now that is 100% function). But no, he always yelled at my mom that she was letting me stunt my growth. That she should be forcing me to wear more girly clothes and wear make up. He wanted me to dress more like a typical girl. Screw that I think it looks dumb, makes me feel dumb, and I didn't want to do it. I needed to do it and my mom was just enabling me by not forcing me.
He always came first. For example, My senior year of high school, I’m in a club for the 2nd year (which is a huge deal for me, since I never did clubs) and I was doing a competition that I felt great about and was about to head to the state competition. I had a shot at nationals. He was planning on getting married and had 2 dates he was thinking about. My birthday weekend or the week after (the weekend of nationals). I do not care about my birthday and really wanted to go to nationals. He said to my face that I wasn't going to make the cut and he planned the wedding for that weekend. I got 1st in state. And he made sure to say as much as he could to make me feel guilty A F if I decided to go to nationals instead of his wedding. (And this competition was directly related to my future major). This is just the biggie that has stuck with me over the years, but basically, if there's anything you want to plan, his plans will always be more important and screw you for thinking otherwise. But he never sees that.
When I got a great internship offer, he almost immediately started trying to put it down like it wasn't that great. His wife shut him up.
I'm a naturally shy person and don't like doing much that pushes me into the spotlight. But I should be able to share with my family, right? But after years of verbal abuse from my brother, I don't like telling him anything. I bring my first B F home for thanksgiving, which at 23 years old, is still a very odd concept to me. He gets beyond pissed because I didn't tell him. He then starts bringing up every little thing that I have done wrong and that my mom has done wrong. He feels insulted and wants nothing more than to just storm off and drive home. His wife made him stay, but so much for a happy thanksgiving. I try to explain why I didn't tell him, but nope, won't see it from my point of view. We manage to get him to stay for dinner but he's more or less said that he's never going over to my parents house again. He eventually called up my mom and said he would like to try and work on a relationship with her, but he might never talk to me again."
"  inappropriate favoritism turned into a teacher-student relationship, leading to betrayal and the teacher evading punishment and returning to teaching.","Students who had a relationship with a teacher, how did it start?

I’d been his favorite since 9th grade.
He’d say it in front of the class which at first made me feel weird, mostly because I didn’t want anyone to hate me for it. He told me how smart I was for my age, always called on me to share my opinion, and always put my assigned seat at the front or right next to his desk.
By the beginning of 10th grade I’d spend my lunch time hanging out with him in his classroom, just the two of us, but he was mostly teaching me about politics or sports. In 11th grade I became his “teacher assistant” during my free period. It took a turn after one of his best friends got into a bad accident and ended up in the hospital. I brought him a coffee and a cookie to cheer him up, it was completely innocent. He messaged me on Facebook later that day and we just kept talking from there. I had had a boyfriend at the time for over a year, but he was a terrible influence on me and the teacher saw that so he told me I should break up with him. I did and my teacher immediately started leaving hints. He was the first guy to call me beautiful. He made me feel like I was a beautiful, smart young woman. I was 16. No guy my age could compete with the experience of a 30 something grown man, of course I fell hard for his act.
My best friend at the time knew what was going on. I had sent her a screenshot once because he said something funny. When me and her got into a fight she showed her mom and told her everything. Her mom told the school. He was pulled out of class while I was in the classroom. Neither of us knew the sheriff was waiting in the principal’s office. When I got brought out they accidentally opened the door and I saw the look of complete devastation in his face. I knew what was happening.
I know now what he did to me. But at the time I thought that I had lost the love of my life. I blamed myself for sharing the relationship with my friend. I blamed myself after I found out I wasn’t the first student there were rumours or trouble about, I was just the first one with proof (the screenshot). I eventually ‘turned’ on him when I realised he was just going to get away with what he did just like he did with all the other girls. The case moved forward. It kept going for years, getting put off. The attorney lost my contact and the case was dismissed. I didn’t know they lost my contact, I just thought it was still being deferred.
He never went to jail. He never was charged. He got away with everything and became a teacher again."
"  parents disappointed as their stepdaughter favors absent bio-mom, despite their efforts to provide a loving and supportive home.","Parents, why is your child a disappointment?

Technically my stepdaughter. I never planned or wanted kids, but fell in love with a man who had sole custody of his 9 year old daughter, and realised pretty immediately that I loved her too. Bio mom is a dangerous narcissist as both husband and kid have scars from wounds she inflicted on them. The mom has made 0 attempt to be in my kid's life since the divorce. Over the last 9 years my husband and I have worked hard to raise an intelligent, thoughtful, caring young adult. We've tried to nurture a healthy home life. Obviously, she and he were both in therapy following the split from her bio mom and they both seemed to thrive. We do not speak negatively about her bio-mom. When she makes attempts to reconnect with her bio-mom, we are supportive and reassure her when those efforts are rebuffed. Both my husband and I want her to have a life full of positive experiences. We encouraged her to pursue extracurriculars and she seemed to innately pick up on instruments, dance, technical skills, etc. We rebuilt car engines with her and taught her to dance the Charleston for a school play. We have focused our income and energies on raising an engaged adult. When my husband was laid off, I got a second job, working 80 hours a week, so we could continue to support her extracurriculars while still saving for her college fund and, you know, pay bills. One of her extracurriculars was pageantry. Totally not my thing, but some of her friends had gotten into it and she wanted to try it out. Ok cool. I don't know if you're aware, but there is literally no way to do a pageant on the cheap. Even with her dad making a couple of her costumes, we had poured over a grand into this. She needs one more dress and we were clear: You have to keep it under $500. There is literally no money left after that. She found her perfect dress that exceeded the budget by a few hundred. We said no. She goes to her bio mom who's on husband number 5 and quickly burning through his money. Bio-mom buys the dress. Husband and I are actually pretty surprised and relieved. Night of the pageant, one of the things all the contestants do is write up a bio of the people who supported them and helped make them who they are. They get to my kid and begin reading this beautiful piece she's written about her mom, her bio-mom and all the sacrifices she made to raise her and her siblings (she has 2 half-siblings, neither of whom live with the bio-mom) and on and on. I was shell shocked. Most of her friends' parents in the audience are looking at me in confusion because no one's actually met her bio mom before. I'm the one at every game, volunteering on all the booster clubs and sitting in PTA meetings. A few of them came to talk to me after, saying how that wasn't right, and I put on my smile and just reiterated how we want her to have a positive relationship with her bio mom."
"  stressed father loses composure in defense of his deaf son, unleashing a profanity-laden tirade against an insensitive stranger.","Generally calm people, what made you lose your absolute shit that time?

My son was maybe 8 months old and had recently diagnosed as profoundly deaf. Deaf kids will often inhale to make vibrations and noise that they can somewhat “hear” for stimulation.  We were on pins and needles as I had just lost my job and our insurance and the cochlear implant surgery was going to cost us $170000. We’d have to sell the house and one of the cars. We needed a break and our in laws took us to the food court at a local mall. Our boy started to inhale and gasp.
“He needs a beating,” an obese twenty something said no so quietly to her friends at the table next to us.
I rarely curse in public and am generally non-confrontational, but a stream of insulting profanity issued from my mouth for a good 10 minutes that would have put a sailor to shame. I found it couldn’t stop and it got on the verge of Bukowskian poetry. I insulted her, her mother, her weight, and her pinched faced friends. I launched into the smell of her twat, how obese she was, how she’d only be able to reproduce with a blind drunk moron with a deathwish as she was uglier than the devil’s asshole on fire with the shit of hell. And it only progressed from there. F Lee Ermy’s Marine Drill Sargent from Full Metal Jacket would have told me to tone it down a bit. I told her he was deaf and that we couldn’t stop it and this was a goddamn food court in a pissant Southern town filled with pissant inbred motherf’ing hellspawned redneck ignorant mutant troglodytes that embarrass normal troglodytes.
The food court was silent and all the eyes were upon us.
And then it progressed from there.
She got up and left crying.
I can honestly say the whole rant was involuntary, like a puss-filled boil popping and draining in a torrent. I had never done anything like this before and have not done it since. I feel bad for her to this day."
"  a weary traveler endures a smelly taxi ride, retaliates with a strategic fart, and unintentionally makes the driver apologize.","Have you ever made somebody cry of embarrassment?

So I'm pulling a long day, up at 3:30am to get to the airport, pull a full day working in a different country, and head back to the airport at 6pm, just to get back to my bed late, late at night. A long day. And there's nothing to eat the whole day but 'road food'.
Even the freaking business lunch that I've been looking forward to is in a low rent cafeteria due to refurbishments at the client's site.
I hold it together through the day, the occasional grumble silenced by fastidious willpower and an air of professional courtesy, but things are going badly for my guts by the time I'm waving goodbye and getting into the airport taxi.
Now I'm used to taxis where you sit in the back separated by a screen, but this is more of a private hire situation, and I'm up at the front with the driver. I'm actually irritated that I'm still holding back this storm of gas that's been building through meeting after meeting with no opportunity for release, but for propriety's sake I don't let rip next to the poor cabbie.
Turns out manners are a one way street. We've been driving about five minutes, and this terrible smell hits my nose. The cabbie has ripped one, I can't believe it.
My eyes are watering, and he just carries on talking about the weather like it hasn't even happened. I figure he's probably embarrassed so I don't say anything. But a couple of minutes later, another one. Bam. It's disgusting, I have to close my mouth because the air's thick enough you can basically taste it. But then I'm just breathing through my nose, which is helping nobody. It actually feels like it's burning me. My throat is closing up.
Above all, it seems so deeply unfair. I'm here maintaining some class, holding back a fart that could jumpstart a second universe, but I'm still breathing the same shit-gas as if I wasn't, courtesy of my filthy cabbie.
I think, f it, if this guy goes in for round three I am releasing my demons and letting him take the blame.
We're five minutes out, and he parks another air biscuit. F you, I think, and I do the deed.
It's perfectly executed. A silent release of a full day of pressure, every fart has been banked since 9am, and I'm cashing them all in with interest. It's a silent rush of hot air, compressed into ten seconds of pure release. I'm almost surprised you don't hear my rusty knothole slam shut when it finally ends. Mission accomplished. The perfect undercover fart.
I know what you're thinking. How did this go wrong? Didn't gamble and lose? Didn't let out a loud, incriminating trumpet? Didn't puke, or pee, knock his coffee into his lap or set off the passenger airbags? Nope. It all went according to plan. For a moment, I was proud of myself.
Then the smell hits. I have outdone myself. It's a devastating riposte to what has come before. It hits all the usual notes and adds a hint of burning rubber for effect. It's a spectacular crescendo of wrongful aromas. I can recognise every awful thing I've eaten all day in the mix. It's a fart so carefully matured it could have come with tasting notes, and they would have been one word in length: Don't.
Now let me tell you how this was an f up.
The electric window slowly slides down next to me, and the cold air hits my face. The cabbie turns to me, with actual tears in his eyes, and says:
""I am so, so sorry.""
""Uh. what for?"" I ask innocently.
""That fart,"" he replies, eyes wide open, as if it should be obvious. ""I mean, Jeez, everybody farts, we're only human. But that. I'm just so sorry.""
He leaves the windows down all the way into the airport, and gives me a discount on the fare.
All the red-eye way home, all I can think is ""I stink so bad, I have made a cabbie apologize""."
"  at church camp, he tried to impress girls with fart jokes, but ended up soiling himself and losing his pride.","What’s the most embarrassing way you’re tried to impress a girl?

When I was in 6th grade my parents talked me in to going to a week long church camp. I knew of, but didn't know personally any of the kids going, but they sold me that everyone would praise Jesus, ride horses, and have a good time. I decided to go. It was like a 6 hour drive in one of those big white vans. Quickly everyone started whipping out their CD cases and exchanging music and I instantly was like shit. I only had 2 CD's: Britney Spears ""Baby One More Time"" and Everclear. I was a really weird kid. Everyone was trying to talk to me about music and I had honestly never heard of any of the bands they were talking about. I just wanted to jam some Britney to myself. So naturally, I went the elitist route, said I had all of that music and I was listening to some new underground private shit they hadn't heard of.
Once we get to camp all I'm thinking is let's find some friends quick because I can't talk to these kids anymore. I go to the pool and make some friends with a few older kids. There were 3 girls, 2 guys, and me. They were all in 8th grade so obviously they were really cool. Plus, I thought the girls were really hot. I figured this would be the best time, if any, to get my first kiss. Their windshield wipers were turned up to the maximum with all the game 6th grade me was spitting. We decide to leave the pool and walk around the camp till we all had to have a group meet up. The ""cabins"" were separated by grades so they said they would walk by the 6th grade cabin and pick me up.
First thing I do is put on my freshest outfit. Great time to break out my fresh white T-shirt. Can't forget my jean shorts. This was pre faded denim, so this was the industrial bright blue jean shorts. It's summer in Texas so I might was well top the outfit off with knee high white socks. And, of course, for the ladies. Doc Martens. I looked like a weird redneck lumberjack. So I walk out and they're kind of like what the f, but whatever. It's kiss time. We start walking and one of the older guys farts and all the girls laugh. Boom. Found my in. My friend Travis and I have been making fart jokes for quite some time so i'm up to speed on this area of humor. Bam, the other guy farts and all the girls laugh even harder. Got em. Now I'm thinking all I have to do is drop the biggest fart and literally the girls are going to laugh so hard they're going to each kiss me one by one. I start clinching and squeezing my stomach as hard as I can. I'm walking like a newborn deer. Then I feel it. Got a big one ready. So, instead of just dropping it out and laughing I wanted to make a big show about it. I run in front of the small group, squat down, turn just my head around, and forcefully shit myself. This was all out diarrhea. If you didn't know this before, early 90's denim was the least forgiving fabric in the world. Everyone knew I shit. It's running down my leg, being soaked up by my knee high socks. Instantly, I just react and start running. Kicking up shit like mud off a truck. I've never been to this camp before so I'm just running for anything. I find a bathroom toss the socks, boxers, shirt, but I couldn't drop the jorts. I can't just walk across the Church camp naked. Plus at this point i'm thinking maybe they didn't really see it. I was really confident in my speed at the time so I was thinking I could say that's my thing. I drop giant farts and run before the smell catches me. Come to find out, not only were the 5 people I shit in front of outside the bathroom waiting for me, but there were like 25 kids. Instantly, I just ran in my doc's and jorts combo back to the cabin I was staying in with the other kids chasing me and yelling ""shit pants"".
I run to my bed to find all the music nerds I drove up with going through my cd case. It only has the 2 cds. They are like “what? Thought you had Tons of secret music bro”. Wait, did you shit your pants? So yeah that was about 4 hours in to a week long trip. I really thought farting would impress these girls. I lost my favorite pair of jorts and my pride that day."
"  strict parents had an extreme foot-cleaning rule, with scalding water, strong soap, and intense scrubbing, enforced through slaps and punishments.","What was the most insane rule your strict parents put in place?

My dad was absolutely obsessed with clean feet. Every day before school, my mom would make sure we got in the bath and cleaned our feet. I know most of you people are like, ""Yeah well when I take a shower I'm already standing in soapy water, so good enough"" but that attitude would get your face slapped off around my dad.
She'd have the bath full of scolding hot water every morning and the first thing would we do, before eating, before showering, before changing into our clothes, is dip our feet in that too hot water. Then my mom would load our feet up with this really strong smelling soap from some specialty store or something, because I've never seen it anywhere else, and she would scrub every square microinch of our feet with this stiff bristled big toothbrush thing. It hurt so bad. The water was too hot, the soap stung, and the brushing was too intense. I never got used to it, but I couldn't talk back or avoid it either. If I tried to get out of it or complain about it, Blam! Slapped across the face. Complain about the slap? Boom! Grounded from TV, the computer, friends, and books. Then, my dad would come in to verify how clean they were, by taking a huge whiff of them a couple times before my mom would clean hers and he would do the same to her.
It wasn't until I left for college did I experience what it was like to not thoroughly clean my feet every single morning. It felt liberating. I even walked around without socks sometimes (my mom always made us wear two pairs). I still had my feet scrubbed like hell when I came home to visit though. Only those times it felt good, as if they needed a good cleaning. But when my dad stopped wanting to smell them, I no longer had to clean them."

That his friend just refused to ask her out because she was into him instead. He was really getting into his story when she walks in and he clams up like someone shocked him. She was by anyone's standards drop damn dead good looking and killing it in a little black dress and high heels. she comes up and does the little kissy huggy greeting and she orders a tequila shot with a lime. He does one with her and they banter about getting that out of the way and move in to a little more intense banter and out of the blue this dude whistles at me. Shocked honestly as the bar is pretty empty. He whistles at me again while I am looking at him trying to figure out if he really just whistled at me like a dog. ""yo man, more shots!""
Disappointed as he really kind of seemed like a nice guy I go to pour him a shot and let him know I am not a dog he does not need to whistle to get a drink. ""Sure sure man. no worries just keep an eye out we are gonna get lit Yo!""
I retire to the side bar real quick and one of the other guys working that night starts to talk to him while the girl goes to the ladies room. When she gets back he whistles at the other bartender again and shouts ""Hey man! Where are my shots! Pronto!"" This guys starts just hammering shots. Not crazy but pretty damn quick he is through at least five. Girl only did the one and is sitting there sipping at a Wine.
The dude, we will now call Bob, starts to get a bit sideways. Nothing big, just loud, laughing at his own jokes, talking over the girl every chance he gets. He then announces that he has to pee on a rock and walks to the back. The girl looks mortified and sad. She is texting away like a mad man. Then I hear him in the back raising some cane and out he comes with a dude under his arm. They sit down and he starts talking to a different girl at the bar. He is not really drunk but well on his way and says something out loud to the other girl about gay people and walks outside. His friend follows quickly after and the girl is left at the bar alone.
Five minutes later the friend walks in, sits down, and has a drink with the girl. I heard him say that he put him in an uber and sent him home. They walk to go to the place the other dude had reservations for them at. I honestly thought hell ya, good for you dude.
About 30 minutes later Bob walks back in sober as the day he is born! Sits down waves me over and apologizes for whistling at me. Give us 20 bucks and buys us a shift drink for when we get off. I was off at this point and sit down to have mine with him. He lets me in on his game.
He did it all for his friend. Got tipsy, played the fool and called him to come save the day. He said, ""he is a better man for her than me. She is really just not my type"" I was stuck between awe and impressed."
"  friend's revelation: Noticed abnormal behavior when he played piano with a photo, pretending to have emotions to fit in. Maintained friendship.","Friends of psychopaths/sociopaths, how did you realise your friend wasn't normal?

When I (age 21, 1989) walked into the hallway in our shared house and saw him playing the electric piano. He had a photo of the girl he'd been dating in front of him and was (badly) playing mournful-sounding music. ""Bad breakup?"" I said, and he explained to me in careful detail how she had accused him of being a feeling-less monster because he was unmoved by some minor tragedy, I've forgotten precisely what. He proceeded to tell me she was right, he didn't care and couldn't make himself. He didn't take joy in the other person's suffering, he just wasn't moved. So the piano and photo were an attempt to ""fit in with the rest of you. See, if I'm doing this, I'm acting like a person with feelings, and people will like me better."" I did the 1989 version of ""weird flex but OK"", and he evidently decided that meant I was cool with his lack of feelings, and he'd come to me every week or so with some situation coming up in his life and ask me how I thought a person with feelings would react. He eventually got pretty good at this; he called it ""putting on the human mask"". People he met after this generally accepted him as a functioning human. We've been friends ever since. He's very successful as a financial manager of some kind, because emotion doesn't enter into his decisions. He's married, has a couple of cute kids, who he sees as ""mostly gibbering animals, but sometimes they think."" His wife seems happy, but he rescued her from some really toxic situation, so she might figure she's better off, and to the best of my knowledge she has no idea his humanity is a mask. He still talks to me every time her birthday or their anniversary or Christmas comes near, and runs gift suggestions by me: he's totally intelligent enough to see that the stock/cliché gifts are the wrong choice, but doesn't have the perspective to be able to put himself in his wife's shoes and see what she'd want. I'm pretty good at it, judging from the reactions she has to his gifts."
"  woman divorces husband after mother-in-law uses racial slur. Family defends mother-in-law, but woman stands firm. AITA?","AITA for divorcing my husband after his mother called me the n word?

Am i the ayy hole for divorcing my husband after his mother called me the n word? I am black and my husband is white and we have been together for 5 years. My husband comes from a family that lives comfortably. Whereas I had to grind for everything I have. When we got married his family made me sign a prenup which is fine. I totally understand sometimes you have to protect yourself. I had made him sign a prenup as well. I would say maybe 6 months after getting married he landed a job in IT. In our area people who work in IT make over 130k a year. And I was just starting out in my career as a realtor so I was making 84k a year (we keep our financial separate). My husband was laid off whereas I was doing virtual meetings and building up clients when I could start my own business. So when we could start meeting in person again I was selling and fixing houses left and right. So in terms I surpass what my husband makes yearly by a lot. So I told my husband how much I was making and he said “we are rich now” and “I don’t have to work anymore”. I looked at him like he had two heads. I said “there is no we only me… I am rich now and I don’t know about the you not working part. you're still going to work… right?” He said “well I don’t have to and some of the money can go towards my mother since she’s been wanting to redo her house.” I looked at him confused and said “are you asking or telling me? Where is the money you made from being in IT?” He said with a straight face. “I am telling you and my money is mine, don't worry what I do with it. Plus I knew how much you made. That's why I haven’t been looking for a job and told my mom that she can start demolishing.” I told him that I am not doing a damn thing and if he wants to help his mother he can do it himself and I left the conversation. I found his behavior kind of odd because he never talks to me that way nor has he ever been demanding like that. The next day I got home from my office but I didn’t tell my husband when I got off. I walk into our home. I hear his mother And him talking. She said “I don’t know why I let you marry that n-word (with the hard r) they are selfish.” My husband said that some are selfish but not all. I walked towards my husband and said I wanted a divorce I went upstairs, packed most of my clothes and left. Luckily I bought me another property that I could stay at that my husband didn’t know about. He called me later saying that what I heard had an explanation to it and I hung up on him. Now I get calls from his side of the family saying that she can justify why she said that and I’m being sensitive and asking for a divorce over what his mother said is wrong. So Am i the ayy hole?"

I caught my ex husband having an affair the same week that I found out I was pregnant. The blow was devastating. I didn’t know what I wanted to do. should I get an abortion or Should I stay with him for the sake of my baby. I decided on getting a divorce and keeping my baby. Ex husband asked for a second chance but it just wouldn’t do so he moved out and in with his new partner within the month. I also started a new job with better pay but more flexibility (now I’m becoming a single mother) but I had to work my butt off in the beginning to establish a good reputation before maternity leave. When I gave birth to my baby I was back at work after 3 months. Being a single mom with a career was not an easy task. I hardly slept or ate for the entire first year. I lost all my baby weight + 15 kilos more. My ex husband and I have shared custody, but since she’s still a baby we are waiting with the every other week arrangement until she’s 2. But he visits to see her 2 to 3 times a week. Mostly my mom or the nanny receive him. I just can’t bear seeing him so frequently, especially when he brings now fiancé with him. The few times I met him he looked very oddly at me, asking if I had changed my hair or complimented my dress or something. Yesterday we had my baby’s first birthday party. It was just the family and we held it at my ex in-laws. With me, ex, his fiancé, his sister and my parents. Ex husband was very irritated for some reason and just was there sulking the entire evening. After the cake his mother asked him why he’s acting like he did and he said “nothing!”. When I asked him if he was ok he flew at me. He started yelling, telling me that I was the one who broke us. If I didn’t let myself go and took care of myself half as much as I’m doing now nothing would have happened. Everyone was shocked and he stormed out in tears. I know what he said was a load of B S but it kept me thinking nonetheless. I have always been modest and rarely wore makeup. My style is basic black t-shirt and jeans but I would never say that I let myself go? I do look different now and wear dresses and more feminine clothes occasionally but I wasn’t aware that I have “started taking care of myself more”. I just feel happy and at peace with myself now and maybe unconsciously trying to look nice because I want to start dating again? I feel guilty that he thought I was neglecting him. If I was it was never intentional and besides, even if I have started taking care of my appearances now I couldn’t look 13 years younger."

Me and my wife of 3 years have a baby girl she’s 2. They’re my world and honestly I’ve been beating myself up even having these thoughts but recently I’ve doubted if she’s really my biological daughter. We have similarities but there are certain things that have me second guessing. My wife and I both have green eyes I’m mixed and she’s Italian and American. My baby has brown eyes I know it’s a possible for two green eyed parents to have a brown eyed baby but I’ve read it’s rare. A few years back I had to travel for work and I had my suspicions of my wife cheating but the thought alone brought me to tears. I discussed it with her and she assured me she was loyal to me. She has cheated in her previous relationship but I didn’t want to judge based on that because she was in high school and we’ve all done dumb shit we regret as kids. I have discussed my concerns with her and to say I caused an argument would be an understatement. She got extremely upset and asked me how I could insinuate that she would ever cheat on me or that my baby isn’t mine. I’ve spoken to her in the past about my doubts and she told me she would never cheat. I brought it up again and said I had my doubts but I’ll drop it and apologized. She got very defensive and started crying saying “I guess you want a paternity test since you don’t believe me”. I said no but after speaking with my family about it I think I may want one just to clear my mind. If she’s mine I’ll hate myself for ever being doubtful but if she’s not I still haven’t thought about the consequences that can bring. She is my daughter and I love her no matter what but what will that do to my marriage. This has caused me so much internal conflict and I’ve spent nights crying thinking I could be making the biggest mistake of my life. If anyone has any advice or has been in a similar situation from mine or my wife’s perspective it would be greatly appreciated."
"  concerns arise about hidden surveillance in a college student's shared apartment, fueled by strange sounds and potential incidents.","I think somebody put a hidden camera in my house

 I’m a college student and I basically live in 2 apartments. I stay at my brother’s apartment alot, but i mostly stay at my own apartment that I share. I live with my friend who is a pretty attractive girl who is basically a pixie fairy, which as a guy I know older men love to drool over. So, I always worry that since she’s not as vigilent as me and really weak that she would be an easy target for a stalker or creep which there have been some weird “suitors” in the past couple of years, but nothing like stalking. So, today we got a Christmas tree for the apartment and we were just chilling in the living room when we hear a sound from a device in the kitchen which is like 2 feet away in the next room make a “swooshing sound” and then an Alexa-type male voice recording saying the word “Venus”. It sounded as if a device was turning on or off or something like that (we don’t own any Alexa products or anything like that, we both have the female Siri on our iPhones too) We both look at each other and say what the hell made that sound? She kind of chuckled and said did it just say “Penis”, but I heard “Venus”. I go over there and see if one of our phones were over there, but there wasn’t any mobile devices or speakers in the kitchen. I go back in the living room and we check our phones to see if one of us got a message on one of our phones, but neither one of us did. She asked me if I was messing with her, but I was going to ask her the same thing. This kind of freaked her out, and with my paranoia I immediately think if it could be some sort of recording device or something to spy on her cause I’m not there alot, and I was actually about to leave too. The only devices in the kitchen are a Consori air fryer, the microwave, oven, and a Veken water fountain for the cats. I search on the internet about anything that could have made that sound and said “Venus” or even “Penis” (which wasn’t a helpful search.), but nothing useful showed up. It’s exam week and I usually go study at my brothers apartment, so I had to leave, and I didn’t want to freak her out with my conspiracy theories, but I did. As I was driving to my brother’s, I was thinking about it and remembered that about 2 weeks ago we were talking in her room for a second when we both hear vibrating from a phone. I said someone’s calling you, but she had nothing on her phone. I even look at mine and there wasn’t anything on there too, but the buzzing was still going on. There are upstairs neighbors, but they are short term occupants (Airbnb guests). But the phone sounded like it was in our apartment but couldn’t pinpoint where. It wasnt from upstairs bc we only usually hear faint footsteps, loud bangs, or yelling & such bc they are old New Orleans wood floors, but would not be able to hear a phone buzzing that clearly even it was laying bare on the wood floor above us. In my research the only thing I could come up with that could have possibly made the “Venus” noise was maybe an LG Venus phone turning on. It’s a burner phone that has a decent camera, but still shitty. When you turn it on it makes a swooshing sound that may be similar to the swooshing sound recording we heard but I don’t remember it specifically, but the only thing is I haven’t found a video of the phone turning on and making the swooshing and then saying “Venus”. Maybe it says it in a new update for the phone, but idk. That’s the only thing that I could come up with which could potentially be terrifying if there is a cellphone turning on in our apartment that we have been living in for 5 months. Neither of us own an extra phone, especially a burner. Need to know what it could be!!! One last weird occurrence at this apartment was when I was about to leave I heard a weird noise come from the upstairs apartment, as if somebody dropped a bowling ball on a slanted wood floor causing it to bounce then roll. I just brushed it off as it was probably just some Airbnb guests making their usual stomps and bangs from upstairs, but I didn’t know that there were any guests staying that day because it was 7pm and I hadn’t heard any noises besides that all day. Not even footsteps. As I was driving off, for some reason on that night I was curious if there were even any guests staying there at the moment. I decided to just drive around the perimeter of the apartment and noticed that all of the second floor’s lights were completely off as if nobody was home at all. Which was kinda weird cause what made that noise a couple minutes ago?"
"  IT person helps set up internet for a family, discovers daughter blocked father's access to porn, awkwardly resolves the situation.","People who work in IT, What is the Worst internet search history you've seen?

Not in IT, but I once helped a family set up their home computer network and in the course of doing so, I ran into a patently bizarre sort of family feud. This started with my friend asking me to help her aunt Ellen set up the internet at her house, which I agreed to do. At first, this seemed like it would be a simple endeavor: I'd just set up a router, install a couple of wireless NICs, and be done with it. However, Aunt Ellen had a few special requests. ""The most important thing,"" she told me, ""is an Internet password."" I nodded my understanding, though I wasn't completely sure what she wanted. ""Do you mean a WiFi password?"" I asked. ""Something to protect your wireless network?"" ""Oh, yes, certainly that,"" replied Aunt Ellen, *but I also want to keep my kids off the Internet if it's past dinnertime. That's when all the creeps come out."" Well, that was fine. I had some private thoughts on the matter, but I wasn't there to offer parenting advice or play Internet Educator. I set up the network, put the necessary conditions in place on the router, and moved on. ""Okay, great!* Aunt Ellen said, visibly pleased. Next, put passwords on each of the new computers."" She didn't immediately offer an explanation for this, but my assumption was that it was to keep her son (the ten-year-old) from snooping on his sister's machine (and vice versa) Do you want to have your kids set up their own passwords?"" I asked. Aunt Ellen's answer was accompanied by a look of shock. ""Oh, no, no! No, only my husband and I will know them. I don't want my kids on the computer without permission!"" Again, this seemed counterproductive to me, but 1 held my tongue and did her bidding. With everything complete, my final task was to reconnect the ""family computer"" to the network, and go on my merry way I didn't know it at the time, but my job was only halfway finished. The following day, I received a phone call from my friend. Her Aunt Ellen, it seemed, was having some unspecified difficulties with the new network setup, and she wanted to know if I could stop by to help with them. I was wary of becoming the family's personal IT technician, but the fear that I'd done something wrong brought me back to their house. Upon arrival, Aunt Ellen explained to me that her husband had been unable to check his email the night before *I know you did your best,"" she said, ""but do you think maybe something went wrong?"" ""Well, I can certainly find out,"" I replied. ""Do you know if he used the right password? Remember, if it's after seven, you need to enter it first.” Aunt Ellen smiled and nodded. ""Oh, yes, definitely! I even tried it myself."" I was skeptical, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and pulled up the router's configuration page. Everything seemed to be in order... except for an extra entry that I'd never seen before. It specifically locked a handful of URLs - each of them clearly pornographic in nature - and had the curious label of ""NoFacebook-NoPorn."" ""I need to check something,"" I told Aunt Ellen. ""Do you mind if I look at..."" I thought for a brief moment before continuing. ""May I look at your daughter's computer?"" We went up to the girl's room, and had a look at the computer in question (after Aunt Ellen made me avert my gaze while she entered the necessary password). Lo and behold, somebody had created a second administrator account, and their browser history showed that it had been used the night before to access the router. Suddenly, it dawned on me: I'd never changed the router's default password, and Aunt Ellen's sweet, innocent, twelve-year-old daughter had taken it upon herself to passive-aggressively block her father's access to his pornography. It was, to say the least, an awkward predicament. Fortunately, I managed to resolve the situation while leaving everyone's pride intact, although it took a lot more finesse than I had expected the task to require. In the end, the father's browsing capabilities were restored, the router's password was changed, and nobody (save perhaps the twelve-year-old) was any wiser... and even though I undid her work, I left the bent paperclip that I saw beside the girl's keyboard."
"  how Katharine Dexter's dedication to her mentally ill husband led to medical advancements and contributions to women's rights.




","What is a fascinating historical fact that nobody knows about?

The birth control pill is the direct result of a very wealthy woman who deeply loved her very schizophrenic husband.
Katharine Dexter was the first woman who was admitted and graduated from MIT. She was a phenomenally brilliant heiress, but the school still demanded that she took years of basic level science classes before they would admit her. Because of all the roadblocks they put in her way, it took her eight years to graduate, at 29.
She was planning on attending medical school, but she ran into a childhood acquaintance, Stanley McCormick, the youngest son of the inventor of the harvester and founder of the International Harvester company. He fell madly in love and chased her during her grand European tour. Finally, she capitulated and they married in Europe.
Almost immediately, Stanley's mental stability declined. It is believed that the marriage was never consummated. Within two years, Stanley was living in the McLean Mental Asylum. Soon after, his family paid for him to be moved with hand picked caretakers to a house in California.
During the majority of their marriage, Katharine wasn't allowed to be alone with her husband. His behavior was too erratic and dangerous for that to be possible. Stanley's family spent decades fighting Katharine for control over his care. They made constant accusations against her, that she ""thought too much like a man"", that she might be a lesbian, that she was just after money (she was just as wealthy as they were. She didn't need a dime.)
Despite a marriage where she couldn't see her husband, where his whole family actively campaigned against her, she remained entirely dedicated to his care. She made sure that every possible advance in psychiatry was used in an attempt to help him. She brought in the top names and fought hard to ensure that there were no quack cures in use, the ones his family favored.
She ended up funding the very first endocrinology research center. She paid for it directly and entirely out of her own pocket. It was her suspicion that schizophrenia and other mental illnesses were hormonal imbalances. While it would take years to discover neurohormones and neurotransmitters, her ideas were decades ahead and spot on with what goes on.
As part of her work, she was also a suffragette and deeply interested in increasing the opportunities available for women. Thus she used that exact same endocrinology research center as the basis for study for the creation of the first birth control pill. She was so directly involved that she moved across country to be near and receive regular reports on the developments.
After Stanley died, she buried him with her family, instead of with his. She was so angry with their treatment of herself and her husband, that she no longer wanted him to have any connection.
She did use his money after he died. His money was used to build a major wing on the Santa Barbara Art Museum. His money was used to build the first female dormitory at MIT. There's some others out there too. But here's the clincher.... Every single one of them was named after her husband."
"  a tragic accident involving a friend's death burdens the narrator, who discovered a hidden suicide note revealing the truth.","What is your Biggest secret you keep from everyone?

When I was 17 my best friend was 16 and a year behind me in school (we had met in a split class of grade 4 and 5 students). A couple weeks after the new school year started we went out biking on a weekend and he went over an edge on the pathway we were on and died, it was a 25 foot drop onto a rocky ridge line and then into a river another 50 feet below and he landed head first.
It was declared an accident, his bike had slipped on something and lost control and he went right over the edge. I was riding in front and didn't notice anything till I heard the crash behind me (he didn't make a sound going over the edge.)
When I turned around and looked it was a sight I will never forget and still have nightmares about. I had a cell phone with me and called 911 but there was nothing to be done, even from up where I was I could see his helmet had cracked and blood pooling around his head.
His family blamed me for the death even though it was an accident saying I had pushed him to ride to hard (it was a bike path in the city but they needed an excuse) or that I had distracted him stuff like that.
About 9 months later I had to clear out our locker at school (even though I was in grade 12 and he was in grade 11 we arranged to share a locker) at the end of the school year. As I was cleaning it out I found an envelope taped to the bottom a shelf addressed to me.
I took it home and it was more than a month before I could open it (2 days after my 18th birthday) and it turned out to be a suicide note he had written the friday before the accident. It laid it all out including the very details of how he planned to do it down to the bend in the pathway that had no guard rail and the reason for why he was doing it.
It has been almost 8 years since I opened that note and have only told a lawyer (who I contacted about having to turn the note over to the cops - he said no and gave me a detailed written explanation for me to keep as to why I didn't have to) and a counselor a couple years later. The note and the explanation from the lawyer in a lock box as I can not bring my self to get rid of it.
To this day his family still blames me for his death but I refuse to tell them the truth as their religious believes would make it impossible to bear."
"  how men are turned off by women giving blowjobs without enjoying it; they value mutual pleasure and enthusiasm in sexual experiences.




","What is something Women THINK Men find Hot but is Actually a Turn Off?

I feel like this is probably an unpopular opinion, but mine is:
Blowjobs when you aren't enjoying giving them
Like 99.999% of guys, I love a good blowjob, but for me what really makes or breaks it isn't how talented she is - it's how much she's into it. Like 75% of the pleasure I get from s x is seeing my partner enjoying themselves, so if you're not feeling it, or they're not your thing, I'd rather we do something else - otherwise I just kinda feel like I'm imposing. At the very least let's 69 or something so it's not such a one-sided thing.
On the other hand, if like me you get pleasure out of seeing your partner enjoying themselves, and that's why you like giving them - or you just like giving them in general. Then hell yeah.
...but if it's not your thing, I'd rather we find something that is. I don't feel like s x should ever feel like a chore for either person involved. Much more fun when you're both loving every moment of it."
  man learns girlfriend is deaf on the way to meet her. Determined to make their relationship work despite the unexpected revelation.,"I’m finding out my girlfriend of 1 year is deaf as I’m on the bus on my way to see her for the first time

I’m finding out my girlfriend of 1 year is deaf as I’m on the bus on my way to see her for the first time. I met her in a match of League of legends two years ago. We talked a lot, became really close and basically started dating one year ago. We send each other pictures all the time and videos as well so I never understood her apprehension to facetime me. We tell each other everything, I mean everything. She’s presented me to her parents and I know all her family. Today I was gonna surprise her by visiting for the first time. I talked with her sister to make sure it was ok. Less than 30 minutes ago, I got a text from her (and I'm copying and pasting a translated version) : “Hey love, you are so sweet and beautiful and you deserve so much better. I know you are coming because Sarah told me. I’m sorry to ruin your surprise. I’d hate to see your face when you find out. I know we promised to always be truthful but I’ve been lying to you all this time. “ That was her first paragraph and I was so scared because I thought she was breaking up with me, but then she continued: “You are too caring to ask why I never speak, why I never sent you a voice note. You are just too perfect and there’s no way you’d be with me if you knew. The reason is very simple, I was born deaf. I’m sorry you have to find out this way. I’m just a coward for not telling you sooner. I’ll understand if you don’t wanna be with me anymore”. God damn, I was expecting something totally different and now I’m scared cause I’ve never interacted with a deaf person and I want to make sure she gets that I love her either way. I’m still in disbelief that she thought it'd be a deal breaker for me. I would do anything to try and make it work but I hope she feels the same. "
"  in a regrettable incident, the person accidentally created toxic fumes while attempting to kill a persistent cockroach. Seeking advice for safety.","TIFU killing a juggernaut cockroach.

so there was this MASSIVE cockroach in my room this morning that was crawling on my wall. I smacked it with a shoe, assumed it was dead, and went on with my day. About 30 minutes go by, and I see the same cockroach again, hobbling around. I hit it AGAIN with a shoe. It looks very dead. But then, later, I see THE SAME MOTHEREFFER limping with its guts spilling out, and I summon every atom in my being to finally put this effer out of its misery with another shoe slap. For a while, it never moved, and definitely looked dead, but I kept watching it. And I noticed it changed positions at some point. I freaked the eff out, but then I remembered that cockroaches will absorb bleach when sprayed on them, killing them fairly effectively. I sprayed it with Clorox, but I guess that just gave it more determination, because it got crazy, and I trapped it in an empty glass on my floor. Then I thought, “maybe it was windex that did the trick?” and I went and got some without thinking. Sprayed the effer and covered it with the glass again, still ALIVE SOMEHOW, and then some clarity on what I just did hit me. I JUST MIXED BLEACH CLEANER AND AMMONIA CLEANER TOGETHER. THAT IS THE RECIPE FOR MUSTARD GAS. I have no effing idea how much mustard gas I have created in my bedroom, but it was only a few squirts of Clorox, and a few squirts of Windex. I don’t think that’s enough to kill me, but I’m not sitting in my room to find out what it will do. What the eff have I done, I feel so stupid right now for making toxic fumes in my bedroom, and I think it would be silly to call poison control or something if it’s actually not that bad and I'm just overreacting. If there are any chemists or something that could let me know if it is safe to enter my bedroom, or how to clean it up, that'd be helpful."
"  the person questions if they are wrong for asserting house rules after their fiance moved in a homeless alcoholic friend.




","Am I wrong for being stern about house rules after my fiance moved his homeless alcoholic friend in, two months before I'm due to give birth?

I have been upset with my fiance after he moved in with his alcoholic friend 2 months before I had our baby. He asked me if it was okay first and told me there would be ZERO alcohol in our house. I agreed because he was homeless, eating out of dumpsters and I'm not a monster. My fiance promised NO BOOZE of any type would be brought in. We are very dry people due to past experiences and family. I personally spent two years of my life trapped in a relationship with a physically abu$ive alcoholic that would regularly steal my money and car to joy ride and buy more drinks Currently, I'm the only person in the house who owns a car, so he had to drive my car the two hours there and back to get this friend. My fiance also hadn't been paid by his new job yet so I gave him around $100 to fund this move. He got this guy home and the first thing I see is he bought him beer. I was extremely upset and my fiance told me to get over it because he can't quit cold turkey. I recommend he be put in a rehab facility instead of us trying to wean him like a baby. My fiance refused Cut to a day in of this guy being here and he's showing signs of schizophrenia. He's literally having complete meltdowns laying on the floor and shaking. I nearly called an ambulance because he's freaking me out and I thought he OD'd on meds he possibly stole. I'm already stressed about preparing to have our baby and being the only one working for the last two months, so I felt overwhelmed by the situation. After this guy's first episode, he tried to ask me to buy him beer to ""calm him"" and ignored him, wondering how the crap my fiance already bought is gone. I told my fiance what happened and he apologized about the event, but I had to wait for him to be home from work. When he did get home, he bought the guy beer. I was upset and reminded him he promised NO BOOZE in the house. He told me to eff off. Next night, I'm having a hard time sleeping, which is normal for pregnancy. I took off my sleep mask and rolled over to check the time on my phone and noticed this guy was sitting in a chair by our bed watching us sleep!! I kept my cool as much as possible and asked ""do you need something?"" And he said ""no i'm just paranoid"". I told him I'm sorry but he can't be out here watching us sleep and he needed to go back to his room. (For reference, I have had claustrophobia since being pregnant and my fiance had moved our bed to the living room for more space.) Of course this scared the crap out of me, so I took the liberty of moving the bed into the nursery so I had more privacy. This guy also stands outside the door if (my fiance and I) are both in the bathroom together. He also frequently just opens and closes his door without leaving the room. I told my fiance this guy needs to be medically evaluated in the next month and moved out in two or I'm having the baby and staying somewhere else. This guy is a complete stranger to me and I don't feel comfortable having him around my baby. Neither my dog or cat likes him either, so I feel that speaks volumes. So, am I wrong for telling my fiance l'l leave if this guy isn't out of our home in two months?"
  applicant with Montessori training interviews for a daycare job but walks out due to unethical practices and disrespectful treatment.,"[Serious] Job applicants who walked out of an interview before it was over, why did you do it?

I had read great reviews online about a local Montessori daycare right down the street from my house. Since I am Montessori trained, I made it my goal to work there as a teaching assistant. Even though they weren't actively hiring, I submitted my resume once a year for 3 years. The third year, I got a call. I arrived at the interview elated. I couldn't wait to work for them!
I walked in and sat down with the owner. She started off by explaining how the new position had just opened up. Apparently, Susan, the lead preschool teacher for the last 10 years was recently let go because the owner's youngest daughter just finished her Montessori training and the owner wanted to promote her into the lead teacher position.
The owner told Susan that she could either work part-time as the daughter's assistant (with a huge pay cut) or she could leave. So, as you might imagine, Susan quit. The owner told me this story with absolutely no twinge of ethical awareness and a chilling lack of emotional investment. I was horrified.
Then, I was told that I had the option to either be the aforementioned daughter's assistant teacher or her other daughter's assistant teacher. Yes, joy of joys: the owner and her two daughters ran all of the classrooms. No nepotism there...
As I sat reeling from this information, with a growing sense of nausea and anxiety, the boss then began to prattle off a laundry list of daily tasks and responsibilities as well as personal pet peeves.
""We teach children manners here! They need to learn to push in their chairs! They have to walk AROUND the rugs, not ON them!"" etc.. etc...
I look at the clock and realize that the boss has been talking for 20 minutes straight and she hasn't asked me any questions. In fact, she hasn't even let me speak yet. I politely pardon myself for interrupting her and say, ""I'm sorry, can I just ask, what are the hours for this position...?"" To which she responds: ""CAN I JUST FINISH?! LET ME JUST FINISH WHAT I WAS SAYING!"" and then she delves into another 30 minutes (I'm not kidding you - I'm watching the clock) of rules, commands, and other babble.
During her half-hour speech, I find myself getting increasingly anxious. The walls are closing in. I'm fading in and out, wondering if maybe I can fake needing to vomit and run out of the room and then just... keep running, get in my car, and drive away. No, I say to myself: I am 30 years old. That is just pathetic. I'm not going to be scared off by this mean old bitch!
Finally, it's been almost an hour. I grab my keys and set my portfolio decidedly on my lap.  ""I'm sorry."" I say.  ""I have been here for 55 minutes and you haven't asked me a single question, you haven't allowed me to ask you a single question, and from what I can tell, this job is not going to be a good fit for me. I don't want to waste any more of your time.""
I get up to leave and the woman freaks out and starts arguing with me about how I was the one who sent her the resume in the first place and what makes me think that I wouldn't be a good fit, and how she'd probably just have to fire me anyway.
I excuse myself and scoot out of the room as fast as possible. I think that by the time I get home, I'm safe and it's all over. I open up my email to see that the woman has written a furious tirade about how rude and horrible I am. She goes on to tell me how she has never been so disrespected in all of her life and how she is ""shredding"" my resume. "
"  twin brothers successfully swap places for a psychology exam, fooling the professor and even gaining the interest of a TA.","Identical twins, What's the greatest thing you've achieved by “Swapping Places”?

My twin and I have pulled a lot of switches and pranks before, but this particular one stands out in my mind all too well.
Sophomore year of college, my brother was taking a Psychology 101 class as a prerequisite. On one particular Tuesday, he approached me with a dilemma that he needed my help with. Thursday around noon he had an exam in Psych, but that same morning his girlfriends family was flying out to California to go to Disneyland and they picked him up a plane ticket. Of course I told him ""Ok bro, I'll go to Disneyland for you."" But we all know that wouldn't be the case no matter how much I tried.
He left me with all of the material I'd need and I started studying away in the hopes of acing this exam for him (or not heinously screwing up his grade). Here was the catch with the exam room, this professor was notorious for making it impossible to cheat. We'll call him Mr. J for this one. Mr. J had 7 TA's who would walk around during the exam and check the two forms of ID he required you to have and would constantly walk up and down the isles to check for any form of cheating. My brother, having known this, left me with some of his IDs and wished me all the best.
Exam time comes and I'm killing it. Just in case they'd notice any minute differences in looks or handwriting, I wore a backwards hat and wrapped up my hand as though it was injured. You can never be too sure. Now my twin and I love to play pranks on each other, it's just what we do. So I can't help but notice a cute blonde TA that is walking the isles. The first time she passes me, I look up and give her a smile, almost like a cocky grin. The second lap through I look up again and whisper ""hi"" with an almost innocent smile. This continues throughout the exam until the last run-through I whisper to her that I think she's cute. As luck would have it, she blushed and said I was too. When I went to turn in my exam, someone from on high was smiling down on me because she approached and gave me her number. Of course, she wasn't giving me her number, she was giving my brother her number. Knowing this, I told her I'd call her that weekend. Next week of class, she approached my brother and asked him why he never called.
I wound up getting him a B and no one was the wiser. However, our story continues on two years later. I needed one more elective to graduate, and I figured I'd take the Psych class that held the funny memory. The semester was going fine until one day I get an email from Mr. J, a very angry email, asking me to meet with him before class starts. As it turns out, the world could not be any smaller. Mr. J's mother (we'll say Mrs. M) lived in an apartment complex designed for the elderly. In this same complex resided my Grandma who raised my brother and I. The two of them happened to become best friends. Mrs. M invited over her son, Mr. J, to have lunch with my grandma and herself. It was there that the topic of twins was brought up and my grandma told a wonderful tale of how her twin grandsons pulled this heist off in a psychology class, all the while not knowing how it was his psych class. Oh he had some questions for me.
I went down to meet with him, expecting certain expulsion for myself and/or my brother. Luck was on our side though, because he just wanted to know exactly how we pulled it off. Every little detail he made note of. He spoke to the class (and it's to my knowledge that he tells the same story every semester now) and informed them that the only evident way to cheat in his class was to have an identical twin brother, but now they know to look for that. Also hats are no longer allowed when taking the exam. I was not punished for it because he said I helped him out and all I did was get my brother a B, so it made him laugh"

Tonight, after a very stressful day of exams and studying for my ancient literature class, I decided to casually scroll tinder. It had been a while and I just needed to destress. Little did I know, this would cause me more stress than I could have possibly imagined. I swiped right on a girl who was less than a mile away. She was 25, a little older than me but she was super hot and she seemed into me, so I went with it. She invited me over to her apartment, and she said that she had to go in 20 minutes so make it fast. Needless to say, we got straight to business, but about three minutes after we began, we heard the front door open. She told me to stop, so I stopped and we listened. The footsteps came in our direction and I got pretty scared. I expected it would be like when my parents caught me a few years ago with my ex, and it would be embarrassing all around.  Not at all. The ancient literature professor, who I absolutely despise, and whose test I was frantically studying for, walked into the room and froze. He saw her, gasped, and then saw my face. His face turned red, and he screamed “GET THE FCK OUT OF MY HOUSE!!!” I’m pretty sure I lost some of my hearing from how loud he yelled. Anyways I put my shorts on and ran back to my quad. Now, as I lay in bed, all I can think of is how my college professor saw me naked, not just naked but he also saw me absolutely rawdogging his daughter without any clothes at all on my JIDION SHT He already didn’t like me, and he is a very tough grader… So I already know that I am going to absolutely bomb this final and destroy my GPA.

  unintentional first word drama: Nephew says uncle's name causing family conflict. OP unsure if an apology is necessary.,"AITA for being my nephew's first word?

Am I the ayy hole for being my nephew's first word? My brother and his wife have a baby over a year old, he's 15 months. I regularly babysit him. I don't mind it because I'm happy to help my brother, although his wife is a stay at home so I'm not sure why I have to, but I don't want to cause trouble. I work and own a dairy farm. I asked my brother if it's ok to take his son to work with me whenever i Babysit, otherwise I would get nothing done (I have proper safety precautions in place and he only comes with me in the tractor because it has a proper car seat). He said it's fine. My nephew loves animals. He makes all kinds of excited noises and I try to encourage him to pet them when I hold him (they are all vaccinated and dosed regularly and calm again cleared with my bro). We spend a lot of time together. My brother and his wife have been trying to get him to say his first words, although it's not simple and they don't exactly make it easier. Instead of mamma or dadda, they coax him to say Mother and father, and my nephew just doesn't get it. He's a baby and those words seem kinda complicated for a baby. We were all over at my parents house for a Sunday get together and I was sitting, playing blocks with my nephew. He suddenly looks up at me and starts going Bee bee bee bee. I thought it was just normal baby talk. Then he gets more aggressive repeating those letters over and over again. Then He starts going Nunununun. He then shouts ben and points at me and laughs, ben ben ben. My brother and sister in law started yelling at me, saying I was coaching him and how I was being selfish. They immediately pick him up and My brother yells at me, ""you took away his first word. That was supposed to be our moment"". They storm off to another room, they stay in there for about 10 mins, and then come out and leave. But as they are leaving the baby looks at me again and shouts, in the playful baby voice, Ben and points at me again. My sister in law shouts at her son so her son starts crying, then she shouts at him more and starts crying herself and they leave. My parents think I'm an ass and I shouldn't have been teaching him my name, but I haven't. The only time he hears my name is when anyone else says it. They think I should apologize to My sister in law for ruining what should have been a mothers special moment. But honestly, My sister in law doesn't act like much of a mother. She doesn't work, I have her son 5 days a week. I refuse to take him on Saturdays and Sundays because I want to get some nitty gritty work done and she throws fits about it. At family events he's always offloaded to me. To play with, to feed, to calm down any tantrums and to change when he goes to the bathroom in his diapers."
"  years after their brother's disappearance, the narrator believes he left with an older man he was romantically involved with.","I think I know what happened to my brother

My brother went missing years ago. And when I say missing, I mean that his case was declared one of those creepy unsolved mysteries. It was on the news. I distinctly remember my parents interviewing for the news in our living room. I think I know what happened to him. I was very young when he went missing. I barely remember him, but I do remember that I loved him a lot. He would pull me around our block in a wagon. Most kids his age didn't do that. The days before he disappeared, I remember him staying home and babysitting me. I stayed in my room and played Nintendo 64. Throughout the day, a guy came over. I remember him. He was older, almost our dad's age. My brother made me go into my room whenever I heard the doorbell. Later, after the guy left, my brother would ask me not to say anything about the guy. With my brain only being focused on video games and extra dessert at that age, I agreed. I didn't care, nor did I comprehend the gravity of the situation. The day before he disappeared, I remember the older guy coming over. I was in the kitchen and remember looking up and seeing him kiss my brother. They hugged. They didn't care that I saw them. The older guy waved at me and I waved back, then I kept watching cartoons. I fell asleep on the couch and woke up to my brother whispering outside our front door. ""Don't worry, he's asleep,"" he said. The older guy said something I couldn't hear. Then my brother said something I couldn't make out, but I made out the words ""visit them"" or maybe he said ""visit him""? Either way, I know the word 'visit' was in his sentence. The man raised his voice and said no. Then I heard ""plan"" and ""city."" Then I fell asleep again. The next morning, the day he disappeared, my parents were at work. My brother was acting very strange. I remember he kept checking the clock. In the afternoon, I remember him picking me up and asking me if I wanted to go in the wagon. I was too hooked on Nintendo 64 and said no. He almost begged me and I said no again. Then he told me he had to run to our neighbour's house for something, I don't even remember what he said. I said okay. He reminded me to not open the door for anyone, only mom and dad. I shouted at him ""Okay!"" because Super Mario was getting on my nerves and he wasn't helping. He gave me a hug and told me he loved me and left. He never came back. All these years later and I think he was in love with that man. I know he was. The memories randomly came flooding back to me earlier, I'm not quite sure why. But it has been taking over my thoughts lately. I can't sleep because I keep thinking about it. I think my brother left with that man and they ran away together. Or maybe something worse happened. But I don't think that's the case. My freshman year of college, I was part of a sports team that got national recognition. I remember my team's picture was on ESPN and with our university's name. A few days later, I got mail at my dorm. It was a gift basket. I thought it was from my parents, so I didn't read the card. I threw it away immediately and ate what was in it, but it was nothing but candy. Nerds, jolly ranchers, Tootsie Rolls and Hershey's Kisses. I called my dad and thanked him for the gift basket and he said he didn't send one, neither did mom. Then I got to thinking: all of those candies were what I used to eat as a kid. Literally all I ate for the earliest years of my life were those candies. I tried to find the card, but I couldn't. Then I began to think about how my brother would wheel me in the wagon to the gas station close to our house so I could get candy after dinner, even though it was a ""no no"" from mom. Months later, during Christmas, I got an unmarked Christmas card. The only thing written on it was a smiley face. Since then, I've heard nothing. No one I know sent that card. I have never responded. I wonder, every day, if he's out there. I have never told anyone this. When the police asked me what happened that day, I told them that he went to the neighbor's because that's all I remembered, honestly. It destroyed my parents. My mom became addicted to pain killers and my dad has had three extra marital affairs. It has ruined our family, and maybe my brother knows what he did. Maybe he regrets it and knows he can't come back home. But if I could see him today, I would just want to tell him that he is always welcome in my home. I love you so much, brother. We have so much catching up to do. Please come home. Please."
"  the narrator refuses to attend their daughter's wedding if her biological father is present, due to past trauma and resentment.




","I told my daughter that I won't attend her wedding if her biological father is there

24 years ago, a close friend of mine forced himself onto me and got me pregnant by the encounter. I was inconsolable for months after the event. To make matters worse, I found out I was pregnant at about 20 weeks and where I lived at the time, it was illegal to terminate pregnancy after the first trimester. My husband had really been my rock and my support during that time and I do not know how I would have ended up if not for him. He said that I could put it up for adoption or I could keep the child and he would raise it like our other children. I decided to not give it up for adoption but raising the kid was hard. We both have blonde hair. However, our daughter Luna has dark hair and a darker complexion like her biological father. I often heard snide remarks about me being an unfaithful wife because it was obvious that she was not my husband's child. It was especially hard for me when Luna was young because she looked so much like her dad. My husband took care of my daughter most of the time since I had bad flashbacks whenever I saw her face from when I was assaulted. As she grew up, it died down a bit, but I would still get these horrible panic attacks when I saw her wearing boys' clothes and short hair. Since I was prone to having panic attacks, Luna ended up being closer to my husband than she was to me. Also, she often ended up getting a little more than her siblings from my husband as some sort of compensation because of me. We never told her that she was the product of what it was because I was too ashamed and my husband did not want her feeling different from her siblings. I often told her that me and her biological father got into an altercation and never spoke to one another ever again. About 2 years ago, she got one of those DNA test items and found out she had a relative in the system. Said relative got Luna in touch with her biological dad and they started talking despite my protests. He apparently wanted to speak to me about something he wanted to tell me, so Luna attempted to persuade me to speak with him. I made her aware that me and her father shouldn't ever be in the same room together. Now, Luna is getting married to a lovely young man. Some of the 2020 restrictions have been lifted so she is able to have a decent sized wedding. The original plan was to have my husband walk her down the aisle but he had gotten into a bad accident leaving him in a wheelchair until his legs are strong enough to support his weight again. However, this is not her idea of a picture-perfect wedding day so she invited her biological father to have the honour of being the bride's father. Her wedding invitation not only invited the man who forced himself onto me, but she totally disrespected the man who raised her. Although I or a bridesmaid could have pushed him down the aisle, she thinks it would not fit the 'vibe' of the wedding. My husband looked so shocked and upset that she would even think of this but I was furious. I have a visceral hate for that man and I let her know that I would not be anywhere near him. She told me that this is what she wants and there's no changing her mind so I told her I will not be attending if he's there. She got upset and told me that I shouldn't hang onto the past but I laid it into her that she doesn't know what happened between me and her biological father so she shouldn't stick her nose where it doesn't belong. "
"  during an interview, the narrator exposes a candidate's lies about her qualifications and previous experience, leading to her hasty departure.","I  interviewed a lady who claims to be more qualified than me for the job

I’m a head of sales and marketing for a major property developer with 10 years of experience in the industry (several of those spent at a large competitors company - lets call them Money Homes - they are considered the epitome of luxury due to the huge price tag). My team covers all of the capital and a very large portion of the country. Roll on today, since we have only recently opened up and are launching new developments for which we don’t yet have the staff, today was the interview day. Normally for those kinds of positions, the person would be interviewed by the sales manager for that particular development, sales coordinator and sometimes one of the sales directors. Since it’s a bit of a track for the sales director to come in for the interview, HR asked me to step in as new employees will be reporting to me anyway. Queue 8 applicants we have waiting. First few interviews go pleasantly well but nothing special, until we meet interviewee no. 4. Meet Annabelle. Before she comes into the room she’s sitting in the waiting area with other applicants and not only I can hear her go on about how she pretty much has the job in the bag as she’s overqualified and the other guys are wasting their time, then I can see her shuffling through papers at the admin desk which was left unattended. She still doesn’t realise that our office is behind a Venetian mirror. I can see her, she cannot see me. She hears the admin come back in and scurries away back to the seat. It’s now her turn for the interview. She comes in, hands me a copy of her CV and sits down opposite myself and the other two members of my team. I look at her CV with a slight half-smile, which I think she took as a good sign so she goes off talking about her major accomplishments at different employers. She told us that she’s actually more interested in being hired for another position at our company which she can assure me she’s more qualified for than our current employee. She then starts spewing out figures of our marketing campaigns (which have not yet been published) and advises me on the results we should expect and what our next move in terms of marketing should be. I advised her that the only positions currently open are for sales staff but asked her which one she’s specifically interested in. She mentions sales and marketing director. My job. My coworkers both look at me in waiting so I decide to play along. I’ve asked her what makes her more qualified than our current director. She comes back to the marketing figures point and asks me outright “how many applicants are able to predict to a certainty what results you’ll achieve” and then leads into a major point on her CV - Money Homes. So I started asking a little more about her position there, what was her area of responsibility, how long she has worked there etc. She starts off telling this long, rehearsed story of how she started there as a negotiator few years back and worked her way up to associate director and how she eventually became sales and marketing director but is looking to leave so discretion is of utmost importance. At that point I couldn’t hold it in anymore, I really wanted to let her carry on but I just burst out laughing and asked her to leave. She just gets very confused and starts asking what she said that has offended me. With the biggest grin on my face I then said “it’s one thing hearing you talk down to other applicants when you’re supposedly looking for upper management position, watch you steal confidential information from my admins desk and telling me and my colleagues that you can do my job better than me by lying to me about your experience!”, she gets offended and starts going off at me that I know nothing about her and she did not lie about her experience and how would I have known that anyway. “Annabelle, the reason I know you’re lying is because I was the sales and marketing director at Money Homes during the years you have described and not only do I know you were not in managerial position, I know that you were not even part of the department as the department was made of 42 employees all of which I knew by name. I recommend that if you do indeed work there, you contact your director as I will be filing a grievance against you for stealing confidential documents from their main competitor”. Her face went pale as a sheet of cheap toilet paper, she turns on her heel, rips her CV out of my colleagues hands and runs out the door."
"  brother sold his share portfolio, now he and his girlfriend demand half of the narrator's valuable portfolio. Legal dispute ensues.","Grandmother gave my brother and me an equal share portfolio each when we were kids. Brother sold his and now he and his girlfriend want mine

When my brother was 16 and I was 4 my grandmother set aside a share portfolio for us. As soon as we were old enough it was transferred into our own accounts, and it was only four years later that my brother dipped heavily into his and bought a new honda. I knew about mine for much longer than he did before it became mine, and watched it grow since I understood what it was. By the time I was given full control it was already worth a ridiculous amount because a big portion of it was invested in Apple, and I'm torn on using the funds locked up as they are, because Dad drilled it into me to leave it to grow until I'm forty something. I don't talk much with my brother, he's done some stupid things to the family over the years and I didn't really grow up with him so all I usually hear about his life comes through dad. His new girlfriend works in law though, and I've received a formal letter from them both that the investments my grandmother made were designed to be for both of us to use not just for me alone, and his was only around $15,000. The number is right but mine was only worth that at the time he spent it too. They want half of the value of mine now and his girlfriend has informed me if I don't give them access then the legal fees and fines would eat up my half and I'd be left with nothing. The dividends alone support a huge part of my life and they've saved me a few times. If half of that disappeared it'd set me back years. I know it sounds selfish but I'm really used to having the extra income back me up when I've wanted to move. I've lived in four states by my own choice and I want to move and take in more before I settle down, if I ever do. How likely is it they'll win and leave me with nothing? As far as I know there was no paperwork or will, just my grandmother's word. She set up my brother's accounts when he turned 19, but she gave them to dad at the same time as my brother got his, and dad transferred the whole lot to me six years ago. For my share I have all the logins, the trading accounts and bank accounts are in my name, and the shares are all solely in my name too."
"  after recurring issues with friends' babysitting, parents decide to enroll daughter in daycare. Friends react negatively, unaware of serious concerns.","I no longer want my friends to babysit

I have a daughter who is 1 year old. Her name is Allison. Her dad and I both work full time jobs, where I work between 35 to 40 hours a week and he works anywhere between 40 to 45 hours. We both work mornings. My friends Tom and Skylar had volunteered to watch Allison for us as Tom worked from home and Allison isn't known to cry very often. At first it was going great. Tom would have Allison in a separate and baby proofed room where she could play with her toys while he worked. Then Skylar would take over when she came home. We offered pay many times but they kept refusing. And Skylar would ask us to bring Allison over if it had been a while since we asked her to help with babysitting. Finally we agreed to them having Allison 3 days a week but they made us promise to stop offering to pay them. It was great for a while. It really worked out. But then Allison started coming home with rashes from stale diapers. She'd be extremely fussy and hungry by the time we got home. We would talk to Tom and Skylar about this and request they were more observant of her diapers at the very least. Her thrashing and screaming because diaper ointment hurt broke my heart every time. Especially since I knew it was avoidable. They'd say yes, but after a while would go back. They have recently started lying to get out of our arrangement. Claiming they were sick but our mutual friends would still be hanging out. And claiming that they wouldn't be at home all week for work, when Tom works strictly from home. His job doesn't even have a main office. Without them knowing, we registered Allison with a professional daycare service. I drop her off in the morning and her dad picks her up. Word got to Skylar and Tom and now they're blowing up our phones calling us evil, shifty, and rude for not telling them they wouldn't have Allison anymore. And claiming I betrayed their trust by not talking to them about my concerns. Edit: We have been advised by Allison's paediatrician to launch an investigation against Tom and Skylar for what I thought was a diaper rash. It was apparently burns, which would explain how it appeared in the course of one day as badly as it had and why it didn't seem to be healing. Allison is not going into her daycare tomorrow. She will not be leaving my side. My boss is offering me the ability to stay home with her during the course of everything."
"  person's girlfriend is being coerced into an unwanted arranged marriage by her strict Indian family. She seeks help and support.




","My girlfriend is being forced to marry someone she doesn't want to

I was dating this girl named M. We had been dating for over a year, but she came from a very strict Indian family. She said she was lucky that they allowed her to work, and they would be extremely against her dating someone, that they wanted her to get married to a guy of their choice. We met at college, ended up at the same company. We did the deed several times which she said was a big no no, so she wanted to keep it a secret, which I did. 8 months ago, out of the blue I received a message from her. It said we were done and she didn't want me to contact her again. We hadn't had a fight, in fact we had a romantic dinner just the night before and yet I got this message. I called her several times, sent her texts and everything. I even planned to go to her house to talk to her but decided against it due to her family. I even tried calling some friends of hers but they just said she had ghosted them too. I was heartbroken and after two months, I decided to get back out there, but just couldn't find someone with that same spark. I had basically given up on dating and started focusing on my career, and I recently even landed a very high paying job. I was happy, yet lonely. Three days ago, I got a message from one of her friends. She said M was at her place and had been there for nearly a week, and she was asking to meet me. I was hesitant and asked her if she was playing a cruel joke on me after the way we broke up, to which the friend broke down crying to my surprise and said she couldn't explain over the phone. I went there and sure enough, M was sitting there. She looked thinner, a bit paler and very, very sad. She saw me, started crying and hugged me and then we sat down to talk. She said her family had seen us together and when she went home that night she was yelled at. She lives in a big joint family, so her parents, grandmom, 3 uncles and aunts and about 13 cousins live under the same roof. She said they took away her phone, prevented her from going to work or contacting anyone. They said they had pressured her into telling them how far our relationship had gone and when it was revealed that she wasn't celibate, her family went berserk. They shifted her to their rural village and arranged her marriage with a family friend who was 65, and when she tried to refuse, they threatened to end her life. She said she played along for a month, and that a week or so ago the marriage date was decided to be in September. She said she told her family she wanted to spend time with her to be husband and managed to slip away, after which she took a train to get back here. I had shifted to a bigger house and wasn't on any social media so she didn't know where I was and went to her friend. She stayed there for a few days, resting and crying, worried her family would find her before asking to meet me."
"  a wife accused of cheating for late-night meals. Confessed secret pizza trips, but husband doubts and is upset. Seeking resolution.




","My husband accused me of cheating because I ate a meal by myself 

I have a secret. I am a mother of two kids and barely get time for myself during the day. I work in a field where I always have to deal with kids. It can get really exhausting. My husband, Dave is an early bird. He always goes to sleep at sharp 10pm. So does my kids. I am more of a night owl. I don't usually go to sleep till 2am. I either watch a show or read a book. That is the only relaxing time I get for myself. About 6 months ago, I discovered a pizzeria in my town. They opened recently. The pizza was one of the best I have ever had. I have been going there after my husband and kids go to bed. It is a 5 minute walking distance. The pizzeria is open till 3am. I have eaten there a lot but I can say during the night they make the best pizza. I always go there and order one medium pizza. They also have a dessert section where they serve cakes, ice-cream, gelatos and cheesecake. This is the time when I feel blissful when I am eating alone and no one is around. It is my own sanctuary. I would always come home as soon as I was done eating. I don't do this more often. Just once or twice a month. The times I would plan to go there I wouldn't eat much for dinner. My husband doesn't know. Maybe because they are heavy sleepers and don't notice that I am gone. I know a lot of you are questioning why I don't just order it. I know I can but those 10 minute walks are very good. Plus if I ordered at home I had to hide the boxes of foods.It would have been difficult to explain.There are hardly any people on the streets. Our neighborhood is pretty safe. I know how to defend myself so the dangers are low. I always make sure my kids and Mr. Husband are deep asleep when I go out. I always check the windows and the doors before going out. I always lock the doors too. So far it has just been good. I needed this time alone for myself. It's not like I always eat there. I usually eat healthy but sometimes I don't mind going full Nikocado Avocado. I exercise a lot and keep my health in check. So today when I woke up I saw my husband in the kitchen with the bill. I forgot to throw the bill. My husband was upset. I can tell in his mind he might be thinking something else. I told him I can explain. He said, ""Why do I have this restaurant bill from yesterday at 1am. Was I meeting someone that I shouldn't? I told him the truth. I did nothing wrong but I know hiding it from him was not a good idea at all. I confessed everything that I have been doing for the last 6 months. He looked at me suspiciously. I don't think he bought my explanation. He said nothing and went to work. I have been calling him but he keeps ignoring me. The last message I got was that he also found other receipts and is in a dilemma if all of this is true. He was upset that I hid something like this from him. I understand. I would never do anything to hurt him. I would never cheat on him. I love him a lot. It was just an innocent little secret of mine. I really messed up. I don't think he believes me. I should have just told him I was going out to eat so that he doesn't have to be so suspicious. I know that my husband wouldn’t have said anything to me if I just told him earlier. I don’t know why I decided to keep it a secret. Maybe it was because I had the thrill of “sneaking out”. But anyways, I have to think of a plan to make my husband not be upset with me."
"  Seniors orchestrate an elaborate prank by convincing the entire school that Fall Out Boy was performing, complete with fake concert.




","What’s the best senior prank you’ve heard of?

When I was a freshman, a bunch of the seniors convinced the whole school that Fall Out Boy was coming to perform a concert for our school.
They started by hanging posters for a supposed contest Fall Out Boy was holding where they would come play a concert for whichever high school in America got the most students to sign a petition (the winning school would be the one with the highest percentage of votes, so we stood a chance even though our school has 500 students in it, total). They hyped it up and passed around the petition for a week or so and then we didn't hear about it for a while.
Months go by, and then rumors start to spread that we won. No official word mind you, but some seriously persistent rumors. This goes on for some weeks, until virtually the entire student body is convinced it is the truth. Then, one day, a black escalade rolls up to the school in the middle of a school day, so certain classes can see it from their windows. It pulls up to the theater entrance and then some dudes rush in with instrument cases. Some kids who saw them swore that they were the members of Fall Out Boy. They must have been setting up and practicing for the concert.
Finally, the big day arrives. Our PRINCIPAL comes on the announcements one morning and tells us that there is a big surprise for the whole student body that afternoon and we are all to report to the theater during the final period of the day. Many a freshman girl spent the whole day screaming about how exciting it was that Fall Out Boy was here.
So we all go to the auditorium and the principal comes out and confirms it - it is a Fall Out Boy concert. He tells us that we need to give them a big welcome for them to start playing, so we all start chanting ""FALL! OUT! BOY! FALL! OUT! BOY!"" and as we're doing it the opening chords of Sugar We're Going Down ring out over the amps and the stage curtain lifts up.
On stage are a couple of scrawny white guys in tight pants rocking out playing Fall Out Boy Songs. It turns out they were some of the seniors responsible for this prank. Funniest part was that many kids didn't even realize and still were convinced it was Fall Out Boy halfway through the fake concert. I was a skeptic most of the way through the year, but they had me believing it when we were in there chanting.

"  a disastrous wedding unfolding with confrontations, cultural slurs, a lackluster reception, and a deliberately sabotaged wedding cake.




","What is the Worst Wedding you’ve Ever been to? 

While in high school, a recently graduated friend got pregnant and ""had"" to get married. Both sets of parents were incensed that their good religious children had s x before marriage and both sets of parents were convinced that the other parents' child was to blame. His parents thought the bride was ""no better than a street walking whore"", her parents thought the groom was a ""opportunistic child toucher"" (she was 18, he was 20).
Then there were the cultural slurs thrown around - mostly by his family since they were white and the bride's family was Hispanic. When the father of the groom asked if the bride's family planned on serving ""dirty rice, heh heh"" at the reception . . .I thought the grandmother of the bride was going body slam the idiot out the door.
So we get to the day of the wedding and Bride's six brothers spend of the day skulking around like they've got weapons hidden in their suits. The groom's family continued to try to convince him that he should ""at least wait until the bastard is born so you can find out if it's yours or not"" right up until he went to stand at the altar.
After a very quick ceremony, the whole crowd heads off to the reception being held in the rec room of an apartment complex. The bride and groom try to make the best of it - there was no dancing or even music (because of their religion) and the food was just snack type stuff. It was a whole room of unhappy family members sucking down red punch and bad attitudes.
Then comes the coup de asshole - the groom's sister (who was a good 15 years older than the groom) had volunteered to provide the wedding cake as she'd been making really fancy cakes for family birthdays for years. Bride was kind of excited about this since it was really the only gesture of welcome she got from the groom's family.
Sister took off right after the ceremony to go and pick up the cake and after an hour, had still not shown up. After another thirty minutes, the bride was ready to just break a chocolate cookie with the groom and be done with it when Sister arrived - carrying 3 store bought coconut cakes.
Correction - 3 of the smallest stores bought cakes ever in existence AND they were obviously not fresh cakes (they had discount stickers on the boxes). Each cake said it served 6 people and there were over 70 people at the reception plus they were coconut - which the bride was allergic to. The groom's sister had obviously spent an hour or so driving around to different stores looking for the worst of all cakes for this wedding. And she never even tried to explain why she did not make the cake herself as she had offered to do. I don't think the bride stopped crying for days and the groom just looked like he wanted to shoot his whole family.
"
"  witnessing a wedding at a hotel, the craziest event unfolded: excessive drinking, inappropriate attire, fights, drug discovery, and relationship changes.




","What was the craziest wedding you ever attended?

Back when I used to work at a hotel I witnessed an absolutely batshit wedding. In preparation we had to ensure we’d ordered enough Blue WKD in as this was the groom’s drink of choice (first red flag). The whole wedding took place in the hotel, the function room also hosted the ceremony so we started pretty early that day.
Before the ceremony the bride had taken 3 bottles of Prosecco up to her room whilst she was getting ready and was clearly tipsy before the wedding started but seemed to act sober enough that who ever was conducting the ceremony was none the wiser. Ceremony seemed normal but I was prepping the bar so wouldn’t have known either way. As it ends all the guests flood out for drinks whilst we changed the function room and set out the tables for the sit down meal. The guests were rough as a badger’s arse to put it politely, I already knew one of them as he’d been to the hotel before, acting like a total wanker when I told him the bar was closed and I wouldn’t be serving him - however he was being especially polite to me this time as it was clear his date for the wedding was definitely not the same girl he was in with just a few weeks ago (who I suspect was a paid acquaintance).
Before the meal even began we were starting to worry if we’d have enough alcohol, these people drank like fish but we manage to get them all seated and fed and everyone is being friendly and well behaved.
As the night goes on the bride is slowly becoming so drunk she can barely stand and has changed from her wedding dress into a very scant pink neglige with a tutu skirt, she’s also given up on using the bathroom so she loudly announces she will be relying solely upon nature wees from this point onwards. Before midnight we are nearly totally out of spirits - the guests are ordering shots every round (I’d tried to deny service but my manager was having none of it and as the hotel was struggling they wanted to make as much money as possible) and have shotted us out of almost everything (Blue WKDS are long gone but the groom has a lovely blue smile at this point).
After the bride finally gives up trying to shot disgusting liquors that have likely been there since the hotel was built they head to the dance floor. The party starts winding down and it’s time for the last dance but the bride decides she’d prefer to have this with a male wedding guest which really f’s off the groom, she then loudly announces she’ll be throwing an after party in their suite and everyone is invited in the hot tub - funnily enough the groom isn’t thrilled and kicks off. Another member of staff manages to calm everyone down and convinces the DJ to play the last dance song once more before he leaves and the groom agrees.
Everyone starts packing up and the bride comes back from her room in her third outfit of the night, a nice grey stained tracksuit. She’s adamant she wants another cigarette before bed (god knows how many packs she went through that day - especially sad considering the money for the wedding came from her parent’s inheritance who both died of cancer). She can’t find a lighter and becomes irate, screaming at the groom for one. Groom claims he doesn’t have one but not taking no for an answer she rifles through his pockets and finds one. Holding it aloft she screams at him that he’s a liar and slaps him clean across the face, the groom obviously not having enjoyed this returns the favour and punches her in the face. The best man spots this and leaps across a sofa and tackles the groom to the floor, they’re now having a full on fist fight whilst the bride sobs incoherently. I try and get out of the way as I’m being trampled by Mr WKD and his scummy friend. My supervisor storms in saying he found coke in the bathroom and the police are on their way - the best man is off like a robbers dog and the groom stands there stunned and then follows his new wife into the function room. We then hear screaming and shouting from that room and the bride has picked up a chair and launched it at her husband and was now holding a second one trying to attack him with it.
At this point it’s about 2am and I am royally done with the day, my mum is waiting for my outside so I grab my bag and head off giving my supervisor strict instructions to tell me exactly how this ends when I’m back for my next shift. I pass a riot van of police officers on the way out of the door, direct them to the drama and go home.
Next shift I’m informed that an ambulance arrived shortly after the police, the groom was taken to the hospital after sustaining a head injury but he did a runner from the paramedics when he got to the hospital, the bride stayed at the hotel and to console herself spent the night with the male wedding guest she danced with, they left together in the morning and a week later announced on Facebook she was in a new relationship with him.

He had the complete set up and isolated the hydrogen in a fairly large glass container and capped it. Then he asked the magic question: ""If I was to drop a flame into this container what would happen?""
""A fireball,"" I responded.
He snorted, rolled his eyes and looked at the ""A"" student (who only did well because he bought the teacher's edition of the textbook online). ""Wrong. Explain to (My name) why, Joey.""

""Right,"" smirked my teacher. ""There is no oxygen present in this container therefore the flame will be deprived of fuel and go out.""
I couldn't believe their stupidity. And just shook my head.
Just before the fireball engulfed my teacher's face, burning off his eyebrows and causing him to throw himself backwards so hard he rolled over his lab table and fell off, dislocating his shoulder, I turned to my friend and whispered, ""Gee, I wonder what the hydrogen is going to mix with the second he opens that container.""

"  paying a homeless man $10 to watch car in a rough neighborhood, saving it from vandalism while enjoying a night out.




","What “you know what, just to be safe…” thing you did ended up saving your ass later?

was going out drinking in San Francisco with some friends. We loved going to this kinda dive bar in the tenderloin (rough neighborhood). Anyway, I had just bought a new car and was worried about parking it in the Tenderloin, all my friends assured me it'd probably be fine.
As we parked on the street about two blocks from the bar, a homeless guy came up to me and said ""Man, you don't wanna park that new shit here! Somebody gonna smash them windows and steal your stereo! Your sunglasses!""
On a whim I just said ""Yeah, but we're kinda late. Wanna keep an eye on it for me?""
He pauses for a sec and goes ""Like a security guard? Yeah, man. I'll watch your car. You got $10?""
My friends, confused, started mumbling about just walking on, but I thought it couldn't hurt much, so I gave the guy $10.
""Here's your $10, keep an eye on it, man. If it's still in good shape when I get back I'll give you another $10.""
""Damn! $20? All I gotta do is sit here?""
""And make sure nobody f’ing smashes my window. There isn't anything inside anyway it's new.""
""I got you, man. I got you!"" He took a huge swig off this bottle of wild turkey.
Anyway, the night progresses, we drink and have a good time, and now we're all proper drunk except for my friend Mary who was our DD. I gave her my keys and we start walking down the block. One by one we notice almost every parking spot has shattered glass next to it. Somebody went through the area and smashed each window to get into the cars. I get this sinking feeling in my stomach. I'm already mentally prepared to have to shell out a few hundred bucks to replace the window of a car that wasn't even mine a week ago.
But lo and behold, we get to the spot and my car is fine - and the homeless guy is bundled up in a sleeping bag and he sees me and goes ""HEEEEYYYYY! You back! You won't believe what shit I did for you! Check THIS out!"" and he shows me this huge f’ing bruise on his face and pulls off his gloves and shows me his knuckles which are scraped to shit.
""What happened?"" I said.
""Some motherf’er, some tweaker cracker motherf’er, he come around here smashing windows and grabbing shit, he gets to your car and I'm like 'Yo, pass that one. That shit's MY RESPONSIBILITY' and he turned around pulled back on this big ol' brick he's got in his hand, and I JUMPED THAT MOTHERF’ER from behind and he hit me in the head with his damn brick but I knocked him good, man, I changed that motherf’er's MIND man. He was all strung out and he run off down the block!""
My friends and I are staring at this guy incredulously. My car is fine, spotless. I reach into my pocket for $10 but I realize I don't have cash. ""Dude, thanks so much! Give me a second I gotta get your cash."" I say as I walk into the liquor store on the corner to use the ATM. As I'm checking out I realize they've got 750s of Wild Turkey in there for like $10. I buy one for him. I give him the $10 and the bottle. ""Thanks for keeping an eye on the car for me.""
You would have thought this dude just won the lottery.
""OOOHHHH SHIT!"" he kept screaming. Then he kicked the pile of blankets and shit on the side and I realized he had a girl there sleeping and he goes ""WAKE YOUR ASS UP LOOK WHAT I GOT!"" and she rubs her eyes and looks confused at us, then at him, then at the bottle, then at us.
Wordlessly she reaches for the bottle. He hands it to her. He's still screaming and hollering like it's the best day of his life.

"  lesson on using nicer words backfired as parent confronted roommate, upset child, but led to resolution and continued friendship.




","Parents, what lessons have you tried to teach your kids that completely backfired?

When my oldest kid was 3 or 4, a few months after I separated from his mom, I found a home with a couple of these DJs who needed a roommate to split the bills. Mike was terminally ill, Louie was a pothead. I was a young divorced dad. Pretty suave home amirite?
One day after cleaning the kitchen I stepped out to pick up my kid, came home and the kitchens a f’ing wreck. Louie got high and decided to make himself a smoothie. He left milk, ice, bits of juice and just gross crud, everywhere.
I told Louie he needed to clean it up, he told me he'd get to it in a little bit, I told him I needed to make my kid dinner now and needed to work in the kitchen, he told me so clean it up yourself, one thing led to another and pretty soon we're in each other's faces, really close, almost bumping chests, fingers pointing at each other, yelling really loud, lots of cuss words, before we both storm off.
I go up to my room, and kiddos up there with a quivering lip and eyes welled up. He bravely tells me ""Louie is our friend and you yelled at him very mean""
Dammit.
I go back to the living room. ""Louie, could you come down here please?""
""WHAT??!"" .. he stomps into the living room
"".. sigh .. I was very frustrated because I worked hard to clean the kitchen, then I saw it messy again, but I did not ask what you were doing or how your day was before getting mad about the kitchen. I should not have yelled at you or said bad words. You're my friend and I will try to use nicer words from now on.""
Louie looks at me and says, "".. the F??!""
Then he turns and sees kiddo watching both of us. ""Oh god dammit! Fine ..""
And he cleaned the kitchen.
My kid asked us to hug each other afterward.
Louie and I are still friends. He's got his own baby now. Karma's a bitch, Louie!!"
"  underage team participates in a kinetic sculpture race by creating fake identifications, winning the ""Most Creative Cheaters"" award.




","What is the most illegal thing you have done and got away with?

There's an annual competition held in Northern California known as ""The Kinetic Sculpture Race."" Teams come from around the world to compete in a days-long time trial in amphibious, man-powered vehicles that they've designed and built. During the year that I attended, there were quite a number of incredibly creative entrants – including a large yellow septic tank that had been outfitted with wheels and a propeller – and I was absolutely giddy at the prospect that my team might actually win.
Unfortunately, a small obstacle stood between me and a chance at piloting the kinetic sculpture that I'd helped build: In order to compete, each entrant needed to be at least eighteen years old... and I hadn't quite hit that mark yet. In fact, most of our team was underage, given that the majority of us were members of the high school robotics team. We might have been more worried about the age-related mandate, except for the fact that having the fastest vehicle was only one of the ways that someone could win.
One of the other ways was to pursue the coveted ""Most Creative Cheaters"" award.
See, the race in question was more of a lighthearted opportunity to show off the sculptures than it was an actual competition. Everyone still did their best to win, of course, but playful shenanigans (like bribing a judge with stickers to ""overlook"" certain transgressions) were both expected and encouraged. Given that our team was lacking in legal adults, and yet still intent on attending (and competing), one of my friends suggested that we all create our own fake identification... with the caveat being that they had to be very obviously counterfeit.
To give you some idea of how the final results turned out: The young man who had originally suggested the tactic showed up with a card that looked like it was the illegitimate offspring of a tie-dyed shirt and a flamingo. His portrait featured him grinning from ear to ear, and the only visible text read ""I'm eighteen. Really. Trust me."" That was the most believable of our fake identification, too. (Mine was actually just a scrap of paper on which I'd hastily scrawled ""Max is totally an adult,"" because I'd forgotten to make one until after we'd already arrived at the competition.)
In the end, everyone on my team got to race. Hell, we even dressed alike, so that we could switch out competitors whenever we got tired. We did pretty well overall, and even though we didn't win any of the speed-centric events, we did get to go home with that ""Most Creative Cheaters"" trophy. The man who handed it off to us even took special care to list all of our various pranks, stunts, capers, and japes...
... up to and including the fact that we weren't actually allowed to be there."

A woman I knew was cranky because her husband was late coming home again, and decided to leave a note, saying, ""I've had enough and have left you. Don't bother coming after me.” Then she hid under the bed to see his reaction. After a short while, the husband comes home and she could hear him in the kitchen before he comes into the bedroom. She could see him walk towards the dresser and pick up the note. After a few minutes, he wrote something on it before picking up the phone and calling someone. ""She's finally gone. yeah I know, about bloody time, I'm coming to see you, put on that French nightie. I love you, can't wait to see you, we'll do all the naughty things you like.""

"  boyfriend's self-conscious about hobbies due to toxic past relationship. OP finds his excitement attractive, loves his passions and personality.




","Women of Reddit, what things that men find unattractive about themselves do you find very attractive, and why? 

My boyfriend specifically becomes self-conscious over his excitement of his hobbies. His last relationship was toxic to the extreme and she would force him to feel bad for having hobbies outside of her and for having his attention elsewhere. It was to the point where he was apprehensive to even tell me what he was doing sometimes because he would worry that I would be mad at him for having a social life. But honestly I love it. Everything about him and his personality is just beautiful. The way he gets so excited when he calls the climax of the story arc of his new favourite anime, or when he tells me he's listening to this podcast of this new man he discovered that talks about anime and how he loves it. Or when he shows me his new character for Dungeons and dragons that he's drawing and goes through the different powers they have and why he chose them for that campaign. Or how he laughs so hard at his little weeb tik toks that I don't understand so he has to explain them to me and he laughs harder. Or even when he's watching subs and I'll ask him what is going on even if I really don't care about it, just to see how big his smile gets when he gets to explain all about this part of this story arch that I truthfully forget about by the next morning. Even if I don't share his passions, I love to see his love for them. And it baffles me to think she ever made him feel so bad for loving the things he loves."

He assaulted a friend of mine who repeatedly told him to stop. He touched her, then he pinned her, then he s xually assaulted her. She hasn't recovered since, and even came to distrust her closest friends.
She told me his name...and I hunted him. I learned where he worked, where he lived, his schedule. In between my work shifts, I would catch up to him and keep tabs. I did this for two weeks. When he got out of work one night, I was waiting. He didn't hear me slip up behind him, and I put the q-tip into his right ear and slammed it in with my palm. You wouldn't believe the blood. The shrieking. I couldn't move. I just watched him writhing. We were alone, no one was around to help him or catch me. I finally gathered my wits and ran like hell.
I burned the clothes, gloves, and ski mask I had been wearing. I never made a sound so he couldn't identify my voice, and as much as I thought I was going to drop the one-liner ""LEARN TO LISTEN,"" I held back so he couldn't tell the police any sort of motive.

"  sex worker forms a genuine friendship with a disabled client who passes away, leading to a profound sense of sadness.","Sex workers, What is the Saddest experience you've had with a client?

I used to visit a disabled client a while back, kinda young guy late 20's and wheelchair bound. I had a whole gamer thing going on because I love video games so I'd offer to play games with clients, have some naughty penalties if you lose that sort of thing for fun. Clients could bring their own games or I had a list.
I got a message from this guy and he wanted to play games, explained he wanted me to come over because he can't come to me, happy to pay the outcall rates and so on. So I visited and we played some games. He wasn't really interested in the sexy extras to it but we did do some stuff in the end. He mostly wanted to play games and talk,cuddle etc. It continued like that each time, I'd come over and we'd watch a movie or play some games then maybe do some stuff but not always. He told me that he's lonely and has never had any experience with girls before and most friends he had abandoned him because his disability got worse and he was less active. Now the only friends he has are online in games.
I saw him regularly for about a year and a half. His mother was also aware he was seeing me and was very kind to me. She'd go out when I was there and offer me drinks and snacks. She knew what I was but felt like I made him happy so it didn't bother her. One day I stopped hearing from him, he was a regular client for over a year so I wondered what had happened. Some guys get bored and find a new girl but in this case it seemed out of character.
I went to his house just to see how he was and his mom told me that he'd had an aneurysm and passed away a week later in hospital. It was one of the most saddest experiences of my life. He was a client but I got to know him intimately over that time and he became like a close friend. I even got invited to his funeral and accepted. It was much less awkward than you might think. Everyone was really kind to me and non judgemental despite hearing what I was to him."
"  during childbirth, a dad faints, hits the wall, and his buddy vomits on him, prompting the mom to criticize him.




","Medical professionals, what is the best reaction you’ve seen from a dad during birth?

Med student here. This past January I was on labor & delivery when a woman was wheeled in around 3am by her boyfriend (the dad) and his buddy. I quickly grew up because she was a grand-multip--in other words, this wasn't her first rodeo and all she needed was a few good pushes. However, apparently this was her BF's (and his buddy's) first time to be in a delivery room. Whatever, no big deal. I showed them where they could stand and they promptly took their posts; BF is holding a woman's hand and his buddy is standing slightly anterior and is holding one of her legs. So far so good.
Well, things start going pretty quickly and I see out of the corner of my eye the BF whip out his iPhone. I don't think twice since I've seen many dudes film before. Whatever makes them happy. About 2 minutes later I'm starting to deliver Baby Boy and quickly ask the BF if he wants to cut the cord. At this point I notice that BF and his buddy are looking a little pale. BF is trying to hold his iPhone steady but things are getting a little wobbly. His buddy, holding the leg, has a front row ticket that he's starting to regret by the look on his face.
I'm concentrating on the delivery when I hear the first crash and it's the BF who's the first man down. And when I say man down, I mean he's fallen straight back and hit the wall and taken down one of the birthing posters that was hung. I yell to a nurse (who's on the other side of the room) to help the dad when all of a sudden his buddy can't take it anymore and lets go of the leg (luckily I have the kid out at this point so I don't start cursing). However, instead of passing out (which happens most often), the buddy turns directly around and vomits all over his buddy who's passed out on the floor.
The mom at this point is yelling (mostly in Spanish, which I speak), ""Goddammit Jose, be a man. Your brother didn't do this."""
"  former high school bully and awkward lesbian develop unexpected friendship, fall in love, marry, and are now expecting a daughter.","I married my high school bully.

She was the 'popular girl' in high school and I was the super tall, awkward lesbian. We were on the volleyball team together and she would always get onto me for messing up. She was never friendly to me and would always leave me out of things intentionally. I hated her personality but always had the hots for her and fantasized about her despite her treatment of me. She was beautiful and everything I wasn't cool and confident. I was one year above her throughout high school, I graduated in 2015 and her in 2016. During my senior year, I made some big plays during a big game and she sort of began warming up to me. After school one day, I walked past her and her boyfriend as they were getting into a huge argument. He was getting into her face and nobody else was around. I could feel something really bad was about to happen so I decided to take matters into my own hands. I walked over to him and told him to back off. Surprisingly, he did, perks to being 6'4 and therefore bigger than most guys. He called me some choice words and went on his way.I asked her if she was okay and she immediately thanked me for interfering. I could tell she was shook up so I offered to give her a ride home, which she accepted. Turns out she lived just down the street from me. She thanked me again and thus began a friendship. She apologized for the way she had treated me, saying she was just playing it up for the other girls and that she had matured beyond that.
Long story short, I eventually confessed my feelings towards her and she admitted that she had developed similar feelings towards me. It was confusing for her because she had never been attracted to another woman before, so it took her some time to accept it. She still claims to this day that I'm the only girl she's ever had feelings for, all of her celeb crushes are guys and it honestly makes me proud that I was the one able to win her over. We started dating in 2016 and I proposed in February of 2018. We married last September and are currently expecting a daughter together."
"  parents' children's selfless behavior shocked them when the siblings willingly traded rooms, showing compassion and love for one another.




","Have you ever caught your child doing something that shocked you? 

Have you ever caught your child doing something that shocked you? My two kids are seemingly at each other's throats about 106% of the time, so when we first announced that we were going to make an offer on a new home it was no surprise that they immediately started arguing over who got the bigger room. When we went back to look at the house a second time, they suddenly turned into professional salesmen, each espousing the redeeming qualities of the room they did not want, trying to convince the other that the smaller room was, in fact, the better room, and they were willing, through an act of complete selflessness, to allow the other sibling the express honor of acquiring that specific high-quality piece of real estate right now for the low, low price of some square footage and a little less closet space. Two days ago, we finally closed on the house. The room dispute, however, had not been resolved. It was that day that my children left me utterly shocked. My teenage daughter, honestly not known for her consideration or giving-nature, announced that she would voluntary take the smaller bedroom. She admitted that she had in fact had the larger bedroom at our previous home, and even though she is older it was only fair that she relinquish her claim on the larger abode. My son, while initially jubilant with his apparent victory, was soon hit with a pang of guilt. His sister obviously wasn't happy. She immediately began picking my brain about ways to expand her new space. Was there any way to make the closet bigger? Could we buy her a wardrobe? Could we add some built-in shelves? My son broke into the conversation. He wanted to trade rooms. He said he didn't need the bigger closet as much as she did. And he didn't mind that the other room was a little smaller. She protested, he insisted. Most of all, he said, he didn't like the creepy shed door outside the window. My daughter reluctantly accepted. My son isn't afraid of a shed door. He just loves his sister."

What was a Christmas bonus you got from your company that made you speechless? Not a Christmas bonus, but similar. And completely jaw-dropping. Worked for twenty years for a family-owned business. In 1996 they had their 50th anniversary, and the owners (the three children of the founder) spent a day going around personally handing envelopes of cash to all the employees. I had been there over 12 years at the time, and my envelope held $500. Very nice and much appreciated. After a few more years, they had to choose between vastly growing the company, letting it remain as it was, or selling it to someone who would grow it appropriately. Being older and nearing retirement age anyway, they decided to sell it. They wanted to show their appreciation to their employees for their part in the company’s success, so once again, they handed out bonuses. They had wanted to do it in cash again, but the accountants said no, so we all got checks with taxes, FICA, etc… I stuck the envelope in my pocket and went on with the lunch, etc, that was part of the festivities. Toward the end, a friend asked if I had looked at my check, and I said that I hadn’t, that I would get to it, it was probably similar to what I had gotten before, yadda, yadda. He said, “Dave.

"  dedicated student teacher witnesses bullying, takes action to protect student, alters test to ensure all students succeed and enjoy pizza party.","Who Was Without A Doubt The GOAT Of Your School?

I started student teaching in a 4th-grade special ed class in September. My teacher told her students that if all 12 of them get 100% on their spelling tests, we can have a pizza party. So far, that has not happened yet. This past Monday, my teacher told them “This is Ms. K’s last week with us. Let’s all work really hard to finally get that pizza party.” The kids were really excited. During their free time, they would all study their words. I never saw them work so hard.
What makes this situation difficult is the bullying between Gabby and Sam. Sam has severe dyslexia and struggles with spelling. Gabby constantly picks on Sam for it. My teacher and school take this seriously and intervenes. However, Gabby still picks on Sam.
After my teacher said “Let’s all work really hard to finally get that pizza party,” Gabby shouted back “Can you make sure that Sam studies since she’s really bad at spelling?” We addressed this with Gabby. Even though she is only 9, she pisses me off with her passive-aggressive comments. Sam practiced really hard for the spelling test. I even stayed after school Thursday to help Sam study.
On Friday morning right before the test, she was crying because she didn’t want to be the only student to fail and ruin the pizza party. I told her that she worked so hard this past week and she is smart.
For the spelling test, our teacher will say the spelling word out loud and the students will write it. 11 of the students have the same words. Sam has a slightly different set of words which are a bit easier. My teacher whispers Sam’s words to her. When the teacher does this, Gabby will sometimes snicker. I can’t f ing stand this. We addressed this before, but Gabby still doesn’t change her behavior.
I finally lost it. This past Friday, Gabby snickered again. I went up to Gabby and angrily whispered “I will take your test and fail you right now if you don’t stop. And you will ruin the pizza party for everyone. Stop it.” She started crying in her seat. I didn’t care. Maybe it will finally get through to Gabby.
Once the kids are done, I walk around and collect all the tests. The kids go to lunch, and my teacher gives me the tests to grade. She leaves for lunch duty. I start grading each test and it's 100% after 100%. I am so proud of my students. I get to Gabby’s test and it's 100%. I finish grading and every single test is 100%. I feel so proud and excited for them. But then I realize, I only collected 11 tests. Sam’s test is on my teacher’s desk.
I go through her test and she is spelling all the words correctly. I never felt so proud. But then, it hits me. The very last word which is always a “challenge word"" is spelled wrong. She wrote “because” as “becuase”. I am still proud of her because she got 9/10 correct. She never scored that high before. And sight words are very challenging. But all the students will figure out that Sam “ruined” the pizza party for them. Even if we don’t announce who failed, they will figure it out.
I could talk to my teacher about letting them have the pizza party anyway- but my teacher is a stickler for the rules. “Everyone needs to get a 100%.” I can’t let Sam feel like a failure or get bullied. So, I erased the “u” and the “a” and switched them. Sam probably won’t notice. And I won’t tell Sam or she will feel bad. She will eventually learn how to spell ""because"". I need her to have her moment.
The kids came back from recess and were told the good news. They were so excited. Sam was so proud of herself! I come back on Monday for the pizza party!"

The sleepy guy yawned and then took a look at the board. He kept still and quiet for 10 seconds and the teacher started to go into a lecture about paying attention in class blah blah blah....when the guy interrupted and just stated the answer without working out anything on paper. The teacher (who herself was a top scholar and had an advanced math degree from MIT) was FLABBERGASTED as she expected a brilliant person to have needed at least 1/2 a page of calculations to arrive at the answer..
She recovered quickly and she then asked the sleepy guy if he had any questions on classwork. BIG MISTAKE...the sleepy guy had a question and walked up to the board, wrote a question down and said he had trouble solving the equation. The whole class was so quiet you could hear a pin drop...Needless to say, 45 minutes later, the teacher had still not managed to solve the equation.
PRICELESS!
After extensive tests covering numerous math topics, the sleepy guy was then given a dispensation by the school for all math classes during his time there - he eventually got a full scholarship to Princeton…"

Ask for every dealer add on they offer and tell them you don't want to waste time negotiating, you have cash. Talk to the manager, and keep going back to him/her. Insist on a test drive with the manager. Convince them you want to buy the car, and get to the paperwork phase.
Then, just before you sign, inform them that they haven't sold you a car. They've sold you on the idea of buying a car.

Once a year we had the drill and everytime it lasted about five minutes.
We had a teacher though that was just a little bit off. I had him for a class during 8th period of my junior year and as time went on, the whole class kind of figured he just was a very serious, quirky kind man. On one particular day, about ten minutes into class, he tells us all to get under our work stations because he heard the coded announcement. We all hid till the end of the period in our positions until the end of class bell rang. Our class room was at the end of the school and it was generally a quiet outside so we never questioned whether this was a drill or not. This happened two more times during the year. We eventually just figured that he wanted to test us with his own drills.
Looking back on it and by talking to some of my former classmates, turns out he was faking active shooter drills to get the class to shut the f up at the end of long days.

We reluctantly agreed and were told that his body would be returned to us in three days. We made arrangements with the funeral home to collect his little body to prepare for his funeral. They were due to collect him from the hospital late on the evening of the third day. However, we had an unexpected visit from the funeral director early in the morning of day four. He asked us to sit down as he had some news. He then went on to say “I'm very sorry to tell you this but the hospital can't find your baby.” That was the beginning of a three week nightmare. The funeral director did everything he could to find him. Apparently, he was sent to another hospital for the autopsy. We hadn't been told that this would happen. Then they said that they'd returned him to the wrong hospital. Another day, they said they'd found him but when the funeral director went to collect him, he was told that it was the wrong baby. I could go on. It was hell. After three weeks, the funeral director, who had been amazing through all of this, came to see us and said that he'd managed to find him. He looked so terribly sad. I wasn't convinced that he had found him and wondered if some agreement had been made somewhere to say that he'd been found. The funeral director was adamant that the casket had to be sealed as three weeks had passed. I can't quite remember but I think he may have said that this was normal practice after an autopsy. I may be wrong but that's somehow in my head. The internal turmoil went into overdrive. Can I insist on seeing inside? Would I be able to bear it? Do I want to know? What if it's not him? What will knowing change? Nothing can bring him back. After hours of agonising conversation, my husband and I decided to accept what the funeral director said. It was enough. We'd been through enough. We felt in our hearts that nothing good could come from knowing. On the day of the funeral, my husband and I sat side by side in the funeral car. My husband was holding our baby’s tiny, little, white casket. We didn't know if the casket really did contain our little one. I guess we'll never know. Did we do the right thing? Who knows? That question will always remain unanswered."
"  a camgirl shares a memorable experience with a client, who sought companionship and gained confidence through their conversations.","Camgirls, what is the most memorable experience on the job?

Camgirls, what is the most memorable experience on the job? This one guy named Steve. Steve sends me a message during one of my public shows asking to go private. I go private with him after the show and he just wants to talk about my life. No explicit content or anything, and in private, his cam isn’t visible to me. So I sit there talking about my life for about two hours at $5 per minute and he doesn’t say a word. I finally run out of things to say and he is just like, “Thanks. Can I buy your Snapchat?” Of course I say yes, I give him my Snapchat, and he signs off. The next week, I get a Snapchat from Steve asking if we can private again. I say sure, we do the same thing. He just wants me to talk about my day and random life stories for two hours. We do this once a week for about a month before he asks to Skype where I can see him. I agree. I still know literally nothing about this person. It’s our scheduled time to Skype and he doesn’t pick up the call. I Snap him to make sure everything is okay and he says he’s changed his mind, he wants to do our usual thing where I can’t see him. I say okay. This time, though, he types to me and I respond. Basically, he gives me his life story. He tells me that he is an independent software developer in Switzerland. He’s never had a girlfriend and has never slept with a woman. He’s 36 years old. He has crippling social anxiety and says he hasn’t spoken to a woman face to face since he graduated from college. He says that he’s hideously ugly and felt overwhelming guilt for even looking at a woman because he felt that it was just unwanted and offensive to her. I tried to just listen and be understanding. At the end of the conversation, he asked if he could turn on his cam and try to have a conversation with me. I agreed. He turns on his cam, and he’s a totally average looking guy. A bit overweight, but a handsome face and a nice haircut, clean looking. I was shocked and just really sad that he thought so lowly of himself. I told him that he was very handsome and that he shouldn’t think so lowly of himself, and we just chatted about life for a few more hours that night before saying goodbye. The next day, I got a Snapchat from Steve. He says that he felt so good about himself that he finally said hi to the front desk receptionist at work. And she said hi back and smiled. He was thrilled about this normal social interaction. We didn’t video chat again, but he snapped me every time he interacted with somebody. Last I heard, he has a girlfriend."
"  teen attacks pregnant teacher with a hammer; classmate intervenes heroically. Teacher recovers, attacker faces consequences for the assault.","What was the Incident at your High School?

A 14 year old girl knocked on the door to interrupt a pregnant teacher in the middle of a class lesson and proceeds to wail on her head with a hammer. After a few hits one of my friends grabbed the 14 year old girl by the back of the shirt and swung her full force into a cinder block wall and she just crumbled. Probably the best free hit you could hope for. Then plenty of students made sure she didn’t still have her hammer or get up. My friend got proclaimed a hero on the news and an upstate college gave him a full scholarship for a free ride at their school. The teacher had a fractured skull with boned chips that had to be removed from her head. Her husband at the time, a teacher down the hall, had to be restrained by colleagues to keep him from ending the 14 year old. The teacher fully recovered and gave birth to a healthy boy and I just looked her up on Facebook while thinking about this and her son just graduated college last year. The motive for the attack was the teacher was calling the girl’s parents for academic performance and truancy. The parents said if she kept getting in trouble she wouldn’t be able to go to the prom. The teacher called and she got in trouble. She came into school the next day with a hammer and sock full of D batteries and told her friends she was going to end that teacher. They told her that she was crazy and she just walked away and said something like “you think I’m just talking crap, you’ll see” I remember a year later a friend of the girl came up to a group of us in art class with a petition to get her friend released from juvie and I tore her a new ayy hole very loudly basically saying the was lucky she wasn’t in prison for decades and that she should stop walking around getting people to support that monster."
"  stepbrother romance leads to public drama. Colleague disappears, stepbrother suspects foul play. Chauffeur confesses to murder orchestrated by mother.","People who have slept with a step relative, what was the aftermath?

I had a colleague once who drunkenly confessed to sleeping with her step brother. Eventually it developed into a serious relationship. Her parents got to know and desperately tried to get them to break up. Colleague ended up dating her step bro in secret. It's an open secret in the office at this point. Awkward, because the stepdad was also in upper management. Her parents find out again and try to get them to break up a second time. It all gets rather public and ugly and quite embarrassing for her Mom and stepdad who are now senior figures in the industry running their own company. Colleague tells us that she's been given ultimatums from her Mum. Doesn't describe what they are. Suddenly, she stops showing up to work and emails her resignation. She tells HR that she's moving to the US to find some peace. Colleague also texts some folk at work to tell them that she's had enough of the drama and moving away. A few weeks pass and there's no news from her until her step bro/ boyfriend starts contacting all her work friends. I wasn't contacted but some of my teammates were. Stepbro is desperately trying to get in touch with her; she's broken up with him via text. He wants to know if anyone's heard from her. He doesn't believe that she now lives in the US and that she'd go without telling him. Everyone writes him off as a guy who couldn't handle the rejection, until he goes to the police and files a missing persons case. Police actually made a few inquiries to everyone's surprise. In the end the cops write the stepbro off as a lovesick loon and everything settles down. For a while at least. Stepbro has gone crazy, now claiming that he thinks something bad happened to her. Says he's fallen out with his parents over it. No one at work wants to get involved in this family drama, especially since the parents are important people. Things die down again, until they don't. Fast forward two years and no one's heard from our colleague, until the cops come calling. They've arrested her mom's chauffeur on an unrelated charge and he confesses to taking the life of our colleague. Even leads them to the body. He doesn't however reveal a motive. He must have been stalking her. Our colleague never went to the US. Turns out the emails she sent weren't from her either. They were sent after her death. The texts, the emails and the breakup were all from her Mom. She covered her tracks after she orchestrated the killing of her own daughter. All because she wouldn't stop dating her step brother and was going to marry him."
"  an intoxicated father admits contemplating violence on pregnant mother, causing the narrator to cut off contact.","What is the most messed up thing someone admitted to you while intoxicated?

My father has always had a drinking problem, but until I was 17 or 18 I didn't really acknowledge it. He'd been such a distant part of my life by that point I didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it. Suddenly, when I turned 18, he started calling a lot. He started trying to convince me to come out and live with him. I wasn't biting, obviously, and I know he was just trying to reconnect with me probably but at that point I was angst, having just gone through a really bad breakup. I didn't wanna move in with him. I wanted to go to college and live on my own. Didn't stop him from calling me, though, and the longer I refused the more often he would call me while he was out of it. At first it was innocent enough, his words were slurred and he jumped haphazardly from topic to topic, but it was pretty easy to get him off the phone so I didn't have to deal with it. One night I was up late finishing a paper. It was 1 30 in the morning and he called. I was tired and felt guilty for having not talked to him in about 2 months, so I picked up. I could damn near smell the tequila through the phone. It was so bad. I remember him sounding very sombre, like he was at a funeral. He'd been crying too, I think, because his voice was kind of scratchy. Not grumbly, like a drunk person, but scratchy. He started talking about memories of when he was a kid. He described to me a time when he and my grandfather had gone fishing early one morning when my dad was about nine years old. It was a spur of the moment thing; my grandfather had woken him up at about 5 in the morning and told him to get his overalls and tackle box because they were going and my dad had no choice. Wasn't a huge deal anyway because my dad loved his dad and he loved to fish. They got out on the lake in a rowboat and set out their lines and sat in silence for about half an hour before my grandfather spoke. He told my dad about how, shortly after him and my grandmother had gotten married, she had gotten pregnant with what would have been my dad's older brother. About halfway through the pregnancy there were complications and my grandmother ended up miscarrying. It almost tore the two apart romantically, for obvious reasons, but they stuck it out and a year or two later along came my dad, followed in fairly quick succession by my three aunts. As he's telling me this, I'm convinced I'm dreaming. I had fallen asleep at my desk and was now having some sort of avant garde nightmare. It had to be. Obviously I wasn't, but the whole thing was very surreal and only got worse. My dad went on to explain that the reason he told me that story was because he wanted to tell me something about when my mom had been pregnant with my sister who is five years older than I am. My dad has always loved music, and up until a few years after he and my mom divorced he was in a band. So he's telling me about how a few months into the pregnancy, his band was really starting to get going and everything was looking up. My mom, however, was worried because he was spending so little time at home with her, and she was pregnant so she was also worried he wouldn't be home much when the baby came either. She supported his love of playing music, but she needed him at home too. He told me that one night, when my mom was sleeping, he'd gotten home from a bar fairly drunk and had been mulling over his situation. He could keep playing all the music he wanted and live a life he had dreamed of since he was a teenager, or he could grow up and be a man. There was no middle ground with him, apparently. He couldn't just cut back on the music a little, it was either all music or all family. He said he stood over my mom for a long time with a fist clenched, contemplating whether or not he wanted to Iron Mike her in the stomach. He said he was so close to doing it that he had even turned her gently so he could have a clear target. He ended up not doing it, of course. He spewed some stuff about how he decided he would grow up and be a man. How he knew what he had to do, and how God had spoken to him in that moment and guided him on his true path. I told him not to call me ever again and hung up."
"  a coma brought a vivid alternate life, followed by confusion, pain, and ongoing grief for the unrealized family and experiences.","People who have been in comas, what was it like?

My last semester at a certain college I was assaulted by a football player for walking where he was trying to drive. while unconscious on the ground I lived a different life.
I met a wonderful young lady, she made my heart skip and my face red. I pursued her for months and dispatched a few jerk boyfriends before I finally won her over, after two years we got married and almost immediately she bore me a daughter.
I had a great job and my wife didn't have to work outside of the house, when my daughter was two she bore me a son. My son was the joy of my life, I would walk into his room every morning before I left for work and doted on him and my daughter.
One day while sitting on the couch I noticed that the perspective of the lamp was odd, like inverted. It was still in 3D but. Just. wrong. (It was a square lamp base, red with gold trim on 4 legs and a white square shade). I was transfixed, I couldn't look away from it. I stayed up all night staring at it, the next morning I didn't go to work, something was just not right about that lamp.
I stopped eating, I left the couch only to use the bathroom at first, soon I stopped that too as I wasn't eating or drinking. I stared at the lamp for 3 days before my wife got really worried, she had someone come and try to talk to me, by this time my cognizance was breaking up and my wife was freaking out. She took the kids to her mother's house just before I had my epiphany. the lamp is not real. the house is not real, my wife, my kids. none of that is real. the last 10 years of my life are not real!
The lamp started to grow wider and deeper, it was still inverted dimensions, it took up my entire perspective and all I could see was red, I heard voices, screams, all kinds of weird noises and I became aware of pain. a shit ton of pain. the first words I said were ""I'm missing teeth"" and opened my eyes. I was laying on my back on the sidewalk surrounded by people that I didn't know, lots were freaking out, I was completely confused.
at some point a cop scooped me up, walked me across the sidewalk and grass and threw me face down in the back of a cop car, I was still confused.
I was taken to the hospital by the cop (seems he didn't want to wait for the ambulance to arrive) and give CT scans and shit.
I went through about 3 years of horrid depression. I was grieving the loss of my wife and children and dealing with the knowledge that they never existed. I was scared that I was going insane as I would cry myself to sleep hoping I would see her in my dreams. I never have, but sometimes I see my son, usually just a glimpse out of my peripheral vision. He is perpetually 5 years old and I can never hear what he says."
"  late wife planned to adopt a Siamese cat named Montague as a surprise, but passed away before the appointment.","What is the worst secret your significant other is keeping from you, but that you actually know?

Even though we had been married for 25 years, my wife and I always invented stupid private jokes between each other. I was lamenting the fact that we had fostered a Siamese cat from an adoption group, that eventually got adopted, and I really missed her. At one point, we were looking through the website of the local pound, and a Siamese came up named ""Montague.""
The photo that they took of Montague was epic. A classic Applehead Siamese, he was neutered, about five years old, and had horribly crossed eyes. Whoever took the photograph of him made him look both proud, distinguished, and adorably insane. Like some crazy dude that comes into the bar as a regular, claims he's the emperor of the United States of America, and everybody buys him a round because even though he is clearly crazy, he is also very charming. We started making up all the stories about Montague in a spoof of ""The world's most interesting man."" Week after week, we checked to see if he had been adopted, but nobody wanted a crazy looking cross eyed Siamese cat. Everyone at the pound said he was affectionate, and had been there for quite some time.
Sadly, this would be our last private joke together. My wife, who had a terminal illness, suddenly got much worse and passed away rather rapidly. We thought we had more time together, but she had sarcoidosis, and her lungs had already been weakened by repeated pneumonia, when she got the flu. Because she was on immunosuppressants for her condition, this is what did her in, she went into a coma, and passed a week later.
My sister helped me with the funeral and took care of a lot of things, including contacting everyone in her phone contacts on her cell phone. She asked me about why the Alexandria pound would be trying to contact my late wife via voicemail. Apparently, my wife had applied to adopt Montague as a surprise gift. She paid the adoption fee and had scheduled a visit to adopt him. But she passed before the appointment date.
Sadly, my wife put it in her name only, and the people at the pound were pretty rude about it. Like to adopt Montague I'd have to pay another adoption fee, and they were made that she didn't show up, and at the time it was chaos I couldn't deal with. My sister gave them an earful and they told her to go to hell."
"  woman was angered when her boyfriend dismissed her efforts to care for her niece, stating that she isn't her daughter.




","“She isn’t your daughter so stop acting like she is”.

I have custody of my niece. We have lived together off and on since she was born and as of last year I've had full custody. Lex had to watch her mother literally disappear right in front of her and turn into someone that I don’t even recognize. I tear up anytime I think about what she has gone through and how scary it must have been so when I was asked to take her in, I did in a heartbeat. My boyfriend and I were living together in a one bedroom apartment but I had him move out when Lex came to me because I didn't want her to feel uncomfortable living with a strange man she barely knew. I gave her my bedroom and it was the first time she’s ever had a room and privacy. I was more than happy to give her that. She deserves a lot more than I can provide material wise but I’m working on it. Last week she came to me and told me she was offered a ticket to prom as a freshman. She would be going as a peer chaperone with the “best buddies” program for special needs students. She really wants to go and said she thought that if she didn’t go that would mean one of the “buddies” wouldn’t be able to go. So I decided I’d do odd jobs that I found on facebook marketplace. I did something similar over the winter shoveling driveways. Yesterday I made $60. She needs a dress (we found one thrifted), her hair and makeup done, and since it’s my 30th birthday on the day of prom I thought we could go out and eat somewhere fun before the dance. She took it upon herself to ask her buddy out to eat with us too. I figured $150 would be enough. Today my boyfriend came over before I went to work and then back over after I got off. He walked in with pizza and beer. He isn’t working right now and is living with his brother so I asked him where he got the money for it. Living with an addict for any amount of time who steals and pawns anything valuable with no remorse will have you questioning every dollar you know you have. If that makes sense? He said he found it on my nightstand and thought it was his from the other day except he hasn’t done anything to earn the money. I flipped out on him and told him what I was using the money for. I was pissed, rightfully so. He said ""adults don't do birthdays"" and “Lex isn’t even my daughter and it’s embarrassing that I’m trying to be her mom”. This is such a gut punch because almost 2 weeks ago I went to Lex’s school after she was manipulated and bullied into lending $ to her “friends” and left at a restaurant after they dined and dashed. The school told me they wouldn’t attempt to get in contact with the girl's parents nor would they give me a way to contact them myself unless it was coming from Lexs’ mom. Even though running out on an unpaid bill is a crime and even though I’m her guardian.Like let me go search for my sister who is probably cracked out of her mind to see if she cares enough to help her daughter. The answer would be no. I'm not trying to be her mom or replace her. I’m trying to do right by my niece who deserves the world. It just sucks that people are making it harder for me to do that. Shouldn’t be made to feel stupid and embarrassed, or that I’m unworthy of speaking up for her. Now everything feels like it’s ruined because just like her field trip last week time is not on my side. I told my boyfriend to leave and he took the pizza’s he bought with my money with him."
"  army veteran encounters a classmate claiming fluency in Arabic, tests him with phrases, exposing his false claims and incompetence.","What is the Most Ridiculous thing someone tried to correct you about, without knowing you were a professional in the topic?

I did 5 deployments in the army, used to jump out of airplanes and was fluent in Arabic, like ""mistaken for a native"" fluent. After I got out I went back to school for Art and started the slow process of completely forgetting the language.
I was never the guy who wore camo or had army bumper stickers and talked a lot about the military. I ran into those guys occasionally and they were mostly harmless. One guy though who I was in a 3d design class with was constantly telling stories that just sounded like bullshit to me. I let it slide because really, who cares? I didn't until one day he was sitting across the table from me trying to impress some girls and told them he was fluent in Arabic.
I perked right up at that. I said ""What a coincidence, Atekellum al loghat Alarabia schwaya schwaya, wayn taalemt al logha?"" or something along those lines. I'm super rusty at this point, but that's basically a transliteration of ""I speak arabic a little, where did you learn the language?""
Blank stare, sweat beading on his forehead, cute girls staring at us with their mouth open. I tried to go easy on him because I had thrown in a little dialect and maybe he was just exaggerating his fluency, not lying completely.
So I looked at him and started rattling off a few phrases looking for a response. ""Ahlan wa Sahlan, kayf al halekum al yeom? Ayna al sooq? Eid melidak sayeed! Ayna al aslahat alKamiowiyah?"" Again, I'm super rough with the language now, but that translates roughly as ""Hello, how are you today? Where is the market? Happy Birthday! Where are the Chemical Weapons?"" (all basic useful phrases you get taught in the military).
Nothing. No response. He'd talked a lot about being a combat medic, so I was tempted to hit him with ""Oh by the way, what gauge of needle do you use for a tension pneumothorax? What do you write on someone after you place a tourniquet? "" et cetera, but I could tell from the way he'd just frozen that I wasn't to get any truth out the kid.
I said ""Ahterim Nefsik"" and went back to working on my clay bust assignment. That means ""have some self respect"". Guy was a f’ing idiot, but I will admit that he picked the right lie, the odds of running into a veteran who actually spoke arabic in a tiny community college art program in the middle of nowhere were infinitesimal. Unfortunately for him, the odds weren't zero."
"  husband discovers his wife did a boudoir photoshoot with another man, feeling betrayed as boundaries were not discussed.","My wife did an adult photoshoot with another guy and did not mention it

My wife is great friends with one of our city's high end wedding photographers named Gina. She is supremely talented and also a nice person. We have gotten huge discounts on everything from wedding to baby to family pictures. My wife recently lost all her baby weight. Gina asked her to come do a boudoir shoot for her so she could put my wife's pictures on her website as an example of an in shape mom. We had many, many discussions and I was all for it right from the beginning because it's attractive. Wife was worried about employers, friends and family seeing them but eventually she figured she'd worked hard, there would be nothing very explicit, and why not. It's very important to know we talked about this nightly for at least a week and went over every eventuality and I thought everything was on the table. So the pictures are stunning, Gina hired a spectacular make up artist and my wife looks like a super model. I mean they are spectacular pictures, minimal photoshop too. When the pics went up on the site, Gina sent me a very classy hard bound book of pictures with a note ""thank you for being so cool with this, it's one of my favorite things I've ever done."" important to note the timeline here, pics taken in May. Pics went on website in late June, I got the book this week. Wife is out of town with the baby to visit her mom and dad. Late Wednesday I got an email from Gina which basically said happy 4th, I wanted you to go through these digital proofs to see if there's any others you like. It's actually a link to a secure site where I have a username and password. So I logged in and all the first series of pictures were variations on ones I'd already seen. When I clicked the next page I could clearly see that in the thumbnails there were two people. I opened one and it's my wife in sort of an embrace that looked like the cover of a romance novel. The guy also looked like a model and was super ripped. With these I was like okay but with all the discussions we had, why didn't she say there would be a guy there? I'd say that the series is 50 pictures long with each one getting more and more explicit. My wife ends up going from like a business suit to just her nightwear. The guy has his clothing on in all of them but in certain pics he's laying on top of her, to look like he's kissing her neck, his hands are definitely on her chest, he's holding her from behind with his hand just out of shot but implied he's touching her. By far the worst is the last picture where it's just a picture of her behind with his face and the top of her last layer in his teeth sort of pulling it away from her body. I looked at the pictures and was absolutely stunned for 30 minutes. I emailed Gina saying basically ""Gina what is this, this is way more than I thought it was going to be?"" She has not replied and I tried to log back in and my password has been changed and Gina won't send me another one. I tried to call my wife but she hasn't answered and says she's too busy to talk. I texted I had questions about what went on at the photo shoot and she replied at first ""attractiveness, you like?"" Now she's not responding at all so my guess is Gina told her about the ""slip up"" and she doesn't know what to tell me. I'm lost, like literally lost. My wife had so many chances to tell me this was the plan if it was that all along. I don't even think I would have said an outright ""no"" but just asked for some boundaries. If my wife didn't know and Gina sprung this on her why didn't she say no or even enforce her own boundaries, it looked like she was having a great time in the pics. If these are the ones Gina accidentally sent me are there more, do they get like literal hard core?"
  brother wants dog put down after it growled at niece who repeatedly bothered him. Owner recognizes danger but seeks understanding.,"My dog growled at my niece after she spent an entire evening annoying him. Now my brother wants me to put the dog down

I have fostered a multitude of dogs in my life, and dealt with a lot of behavioural problems, dog aggression, cat aggression, food aggression, separation anxiety, super high prey drives. I've seen it all, and I've certainly encountered my fair share of dogs who weren't safe around small children. So I feel extremely confident in saying my current 5 year old lab mix is safe for kids. He's basically a gigantic teddy bear, and loves everyone. However, it's always been my personal philosophy that dogs should never be left alone with young kids, even if it's the sweetest, most mild mannered dog in the world. The kids don't understand when they're pushing the dog past its limits, and the dog cannot reasonably be expected to put up with being harassed long after it's signalled that it would like to be left alone. My niece has never been good with my dog. She pulls his tail, climbs on and lays on him, hurts him, pulls his ears, gets in his face and yells at him, and never gives him a second to himself unless she's forced to. He is basically a saint with her, but every dog has its limits. I stay as on top of this behavior as I can, forcing her to leave him alone when it starts to seem like too much, and locking him away in a bedroom if she won't. My brother and sister in law really just don't get it, though. I've tried to talk to them about this behaviour a bunch of times, and they know it's wrong, but they think it's wrong in the same way that her refusing to share or not picking up her toys is wrong. They don't understand that it's dangerous, and that if she was left alone long enough, my dog might lose it and attack her. This has been going on for over a year. I've tried to have this conversation with my brother over and over, but he always acts like I'm criticizing his parenting. Which is not the case; I don't think my niece is especially bratty or out of control for a kid that age, it's just that this behavior is dangerous to both her and my dog, and it needs constant intervention. The same way that a small kid playing with the stove isn't especially bratty, it's just especially dangerous, and needs to be curbed ASAP. I even tried having a dog trainer friend explain this to him, and he still didn't get it. I've tried to come up with excuses for why we can never meet at my house for our family hangouts, but I couldn't think of one the other day, and my brother and niece came over. I was cooking dinner and not paying enough attention to make sure my dog was okay. I asked my brother a few times to keep her away from my dog, but he kept saying she was fine. I did move my niece away from him a few times, but I wasn't vigilant enough, and my dog ended up getting to the end of his rope and growling at my niece. I immediately grabbed my dog and brought him into my bedroom. I did not punish him at all; frankly, I'm glad that he signalled loud and clear that he was uncomfortable. I would never want to discourage him from doing that, because then next time, he'd skip the growling and go straight to attacking. I came out of the room, ready to talk to my brother about how this is what I've been talking about. But he was furious, yelled that my dog is a menace who should be put down, and left. I completely understood his reaction. That's his daughter, and he was afraid for her, and nothing else mattered to him. But he hasn't calmed down at all since this happened, and won't talk to me except to say my dog needs to be put down and he won't be speaking to me until it's done.

"  person's fiancé's family hides existence of mute sister, excludes her from events. Person invites sister to wedding, causing conflict. AITA?","AITA for inviting my fiancé's younger sister to our wedding?

I am engaged to my fiance. We've been dating for 4 years before getting engaged last year. We've always gotten along well with each other's families and celebrated holidays together. Both of our families were happy when we announced our engagement. I recently found out that my fiancé actually has a 15-year old younger sister named An, who I never met despite her living with her parents and me visiting often. When I asked about her during a family dinner, they glared at me and coldly said I shouldn't mention her and that I should forget about her. The intense response kind of shocked me so I dropped the subject, but I tried to talk about it with my fiancé after we got home. He brushed it off and said An doesn't want to be part of the family, so she's not allowed to join any family events or gatherings until she decides to talk to them. Maybe because I'm generally a curious person, but something just felt off. Even at my fiancé's parents home, there are pictures of their children everywhere, but there's not a single picture of An A few days later I contacted An, saying I'd love to get to know my future sister in law. We met up in a cafe and she is such a sweet girl. But it turned out she's mute. She can hear, but just can't talk. Her parents got it into their heads that she's able to talk, but chooses not to, because there's no way a child of theirs would have a disability. So they excluded An from the family until she talks. We talked and I really feel sorry for her. I invited her to my wedding, telling her that I'd love to see her there. When I later told this during a family dinner with my fiancé's family, they blew up. Telling me how I dared to talk to An and to revoke my invitation, because if An doesn't want to talk to them, she doesn't deserve to be a part of the family and shouldn't be allowed to join in family events. They told me I shouldn't stick my nose in their family business. My fiancé sided with his parents, telling me to just forget An exist and apologise to his parents. This angered me because I thought my fiancé would have my back, and I yelled at them that I'm not going to uninvite her, that she deserves to be treated better. Since then, my fiancé has been constantly telling me that I'm behaving like a child throwing a tantrum and to apologise to his family for my behaviour, but I just can't accept the way An is treated.

My mom and dad got divorced when I was 14. Their marriage ended because my mom had cheated on my dad with my dad’s brother. It was chaotic. My uncle was pretty much disowned by the entire family. They got married and had my cousin brother. I do not talk to my mom that often. I do not express it but I loathe her for destroying 2 homes because she had to be a cheater. I lived with my dad mostly. He is an amazing dad and always prioritised me unlike my mother who settled outside of the town with her new family. So since then it has been me and my dad. 3 years ago he started dating Sarah, who was the little sister of his close friend. Sarah always had a crush on dad but she moved away for college. Recently she has opened a business in our town.
I love Sarah. She is an incredible human. She is now pregnant with my little sister or brother. I have noticed how happy my dad has become since he started dating Sarah. I would say even more than he was happy with mom. Their marriage wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. Probably because of my mom's partying habits. They lived as a civil union till now but dad and Sarah decided it is best they get married soon because a new baby is on the way. My grandfather wanted a big ceremony for this. So, we have been busy with the wedding preparations. Suddenly I get a voicemail from my mom. It is weird because, even though we talk on the phone, she never sent me voicemail. I played it and it was addressed to my dad.
She was drunk and was crying the entire time. She said that she made a mistake and to forgive her. She never meant to sleep with my uncle and she only did it because she was angry with him. She is not happy with uncle because he lays his hands on her. She named her son the name my dad picked when he said what name he would choose if he had a son. I realised this must be a mistake. Because my dad's name and mine start with the same alphabet or maybe she was so drunk that she accidentally sent the voicemail to me. I played it to my dad. He looked angry at first but then looked disappointed. I asked him what he wanted me to do. He said that I should delete it. I was confused. He further explained that my mom is in the past now. She has her own family. If this voicemail gets leaked she could lose the only people who is with her right now. And he doesn't want to create tension in her life by exposing her. She already had her fair share of insults from the family and friends since her affair was exposed."
"  stepmother physically assaulted child. Banned from wedding. Dad sided with her, resulting in family boycott. Charges pressed. Protective measures taken.




","My horrific stepmother laid hands on my child 

My stepmother is a wannabe party planner. She has taken it upon herself to plan and host every party and holiday my dad's family has thrown since she married him. I never loved those occasions growing up (she’s controlling and gets upset if people complain about anything), but humored her for my dad’s sake. According to him, this helps her feel included. I’m getting married to my fiancée Jane in July. We got engaged in early 2021, but Jane ended up getting pregnant a couple months after that, and we decided to postpone the wedding to focus on our son for a while. So we’ve had a long engagement. My stepmother has tried to hijack our wedding plans from day 1 (complaining, contacting our planner, showing up unannounced to Jane’s dress appointments, etc.), and we have repeatedly asked her to stop. Dad wants us to humor her, but she’s clearly resentful of the fact that she’s not hosting the wedding or being labeled “mother of the groom” in invitations. Besides our baby boy, we also have Luke, Jane’s paternal half brother. She got custody of him a few months into our relationship, after his parents died. I ended up moving in with them during the pandemic, and have been in Luke’s life since he was a baby. He doesn’t call me “dad”, and refers to us as “his sister and his sister's friend”, but we love him like a son. Stepmother, though, hates Luke. She accuses Jane of “baby-trapping her way into the family” (that accusation only got worse after our son was born). My dad gets along with Jane and adores the kids, but stepmother demands him to refuse babysitting Luke, so we don’t leave the kids with them often. Instead, Jane's brother and Sister in law usually watch the kids for us, as their children are close to ours in age. We had a thing last Sunday, and my Brother in law was out of town with his family. Jane's other siblings live in different cities, as well as my mom and sister. My dad agreed to babysit at our place, and we left. We came back to find both kids crying, stepmother screaming, and dad weakly trying to calm everyone down. Apparently, Luke had told stepmother that both he and our son were going to be our ring bearers, and she went ballistic. She screamed that she wasn’t going to allow that because he wasn’t family. She then made me need to include the trigger warning when he started crying. His lip is still split. She'd never gotten to this point before. We immediately banned her from our house and from our wedding. Dad is fuming and has said he’s not going without her. He’s also convinced half of his side of the family (by severely downplaying what stepmother did) to boycott the wedding as well. This includes my stepbrother, who fully agrees with his mother no matter how many times I try to tell him the truth. Me and Jane are refusing to budge, but many of my cousins who aren’t coming anymore are asking us to reconsider. Pretty much all of Jane’s family agrees with us, but one of her aunts has suggested that maybe stepmother is acting out because she doesn’t feel welcomed by my family. I've honestly had it with my family enabling her behavior. I love my dad, and really want him at my wedding, but I am more than willing to go no contact if it means protecting my family. We did press charges. We took Luke to the pediatrician the next day and gathered every piece of evidence we had. Not only did we have pictures of Luke's face, but by some miraculous strike of luck, we also had nanny cam footage.

"  a father's harrowing battle to rescue his kids from an evil mother's clutches during an international abduction, ending in triumph.


","Have you ever encountered true evil? How?

My kids went to visit their mom in the UK on a court ordered visit. I knew what was going to happen, but couldn’t prevent the visit. Sure enough, rather than put them on a plane back to me in the USA, she went on the run with them & her boyfriend. I got a lot of help from the centre for missing children, the US State Department, and the Scottish Government paid all my legal fees over there. During the 5 months she had the kids, she tried to brainwash them. She told them if they came back to me, I would allow them to be mistreated.  And then I would take their life. This was relentless. My son was incredibly strong and refused to believe her or cooperate ( they were 13 at the time), but my daughter was much easier to manipulate. I really don’t know for certain that their mother did not become physical. But a lot of the stuff she accused me of, was things she and her then boyfriend did to the children. I had to fly to Scotland to appear in a trial. I walked out of the courthouse at 9 P M on a Friday night with the children. Normal process for these cases is to have a designated handover 2 or 3 days later, but the child psychologist who interviewed us all was positive that my ex wife would take the life of the children, and the judge agreed. I got them back in the clothes they stood in. I have no doubt she would indeed have ended them rather than hand them over to me. Five years later, she has no contact with the children. They have anxiety and depression, but are doing remarkably well. They are high school seniors now, and they make me proud every day.

My cousin doesn't like to go food shopping, and he only eats certain things at home. For instance, he only likes to eat English muffins for breakfast. He's eaten English muffins for breakfast every morning for YEARS. He uses that spray butter for a ""topping"". So, if you open up his freezer, it is loaded with English muffins. Like it's literally the only thing in there. In neat piles. The fridge consists of beer, a Britta pitcher, and the crisper drawer filled with bottles of spray butter. You wouldn't think it's weird but if you see it in person...it's weird. When he finally does go food shopping to replenish his supply, he literally buys all of the English muffins on the shelf. Apparently one time the stock person saw him taking all the packages and gasped ""oh my GOD. You're the guy!"" Like he was an urban legend. The legend of English muffin man.

"  an obsession with League of Legends ruined a friend's life: lost relationships, job, academic prospects, and turned into an angry person.


","What was the Worst way you saw someone Ruin their life?

League of Legends,  a computer game, ruined the life of a friend. When we finished school, he was winning at life - good grades, got into architecture at uni, had a great girlfriend, and had a decent part-time job that he liked and paid well. Then he found League. For the non-PC gamers, this is a 5 vs 5 game, whereby you control a unique character and work with the other 4x random gamers to meet objectives. It can be fun, but some players take it rather seriously as the game ranks you based on your performance, and the performance of your team. My friend was one such person who took the game seriously, and aggressively. It consumed him! Like, day and night, downward spiral consumption. He became obsessed with the game and trying to improve his ranking. The relationship was the first to go. Understandably, no girl wants to be second to a computer game. Next was the job, as the late nights playing led to poor performance and ""sick"" days. Finally, the academics suffered and became permanently deferred. His demeanor took the biggest hit. At school he was everyone's stupidly optimistic and upbeat friend. After his spiral, he became a short tempered and angry man who often took that aggression out at the ""failures"" of his other 4x team mates."
"  a college suave guy used body language to make a girl initiate a conversation, showcasing the power of nonverbal cues.","What is your best observation of “body language” that’s always true? 

The most amazing occurrence of body language I've witnessed was from this guy I sat next to in college. For instance, once before class while we were waiting outside the room for the professor to arrive he saw a pretty girl coming down the hall. Immediately he goes ""I'm going to talk to her"" but doesn't move. I had always known this guy was suave beyond my years so I'm really curious as to what his ice breaker is going to be and waiting to see this in action. Being a bit unsure of myself in my early college years this was like Houdini personally giving me a behind the scenes look at a magic trick. This girl was very pretty but had a very bitchy look on her face. In my head I'm like ""no pickup line in the world is cracking this iceberg."" And then I watched a true master in action.
My mistake was ever assuming he needed an icebreaker in the first place. He didn't simply start a conversation by saying something (or anything), he used his body posture to make her start the conversation with him. As nonchalantly as you could get he pulls out his cell phone and pretends to look down at it. When she is about 3 feet away from us, while still glancing down, he takes a half step in her direction, in her path. In one smooth motion he looks up, fakes a reaction of ""oh I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention"" as he takes a half step back to make room for her and leans back against the wall.
Her: (apparently totally sold on his genuine surprised look and re-positioning to make room for her): ""oh, thank you""
Him: ""no worries, traffic these days""
Her: ""haha, yeah. Is that Professor X's Cost Accounting class?""
Him: ""yep. How'd you know that? Are you an accounting major?""
Her: ""yeah. I'm in IA2 right now"" (how majors refer to Intermediate Accounting 2, meaning she was about one semester behind us in the course cycle)
Him: ""well you'll do fine if you can handle IA2, it's more difficult than Cost Accounting is. The trick is to....""
Her: ""oh really....""
Conversational small banter continues......He also told me later he already knew she was an accounting major by recognizing the book she was carrying when he glanced up from his phone. ""Don't ask a question you don't already know the answer to in the first conversation, but people like to think they are being informative."" This guy was full of these little insights, and how good he was at this bordered on social manipulation. So, yeah, body language is unbelievably powerful for how subtle it is."

Game is great. I think the score was 5-1, so lots of action. The energy in the stadium was undeniable. Fans singing, jumping around, yelling for the entire game. Game ends. Munich wins. Begin the march to the subway station.
Virtually an entire stadium, it seemed, exited to go to this one nearest subway stop. There are 4, maybe 5 cops standing at the entrance steps. Uh oh. This is going to be a huge problem. THOUSANDS of people, lots of them intoxicated, heading toward these 5 cops at this one exit. It's going to be a disaster. Some guys start pissing on a fence within their view. WHAT ARE THEY DOING?! And then, as we watched nervously, the crowd reached the cops and .... just ... stopped.
Everyone stopped. No one fought. The guys pissing finished up their business, zipped up and joined the queue. Cops let enough people by to fill the first train, then the rest stopped, and so on and so forth until our group went.

"  suspicious girlfriend snoops on boyfriend's phone, discovers evidence of cheating with a female friend he claimed to have deleted.




","When was the last time you were snooping and found something you wish you hadn’t?

In my last relationship I had a persistent gut feeling practically from day one that my boyfriend was up to something, but I could never find solid proof. He was flirty and kinda 'private' with his phone- kept it on silent all the time, turned it off at night, never opened his texts in front of me, and got defensive whenever I'd say anything about it. I've never been a snooper but one night he went to bed early and forgot to turn his phone off. I swore to myself I wouldn't snoop, I'd just trust him, but when I walked through the bedroom to use the bathroom his phone lit up with a facebook message around 2am. Now, if we were younger and had more of a social life then friends messaging him late at night wouldn't have been weird, but we were mid-30s semi-antisocial homebodies so it was very weird. Also, he had been getting facebook messages earlier that night and he just kept quickly swiping the notifications away so I was already suspicious. I couldn't resist- I snooped, and I did NOT like what I found.
A little backstory- earlier that night he randomly told me he deleted a certain female friend off facebook ""so I wouldn't worry about her anymore"". This girl used to call and text him daily when we first got together and I'd always been nervous about her, mainly cause she would always call him at the same time of night just as he was dropping me off after our dates and he would always decline it. I'm not stupid, I knew he was calling her right back as soon as I got out of the car, and we ALL know that if your significant other won't talk to their just-a-friend in front of you then they're NOT just a friend. But like I said, I could never prove anything so I let it go and we moved on with the relationship. She hadn't contacted him in about 6 months at the time of this incident and I had practically forgotten about her, so it was pretty suspicious for him to make a sudden show of deleting her supposedly for my benefit, when I hadn't so much as thought about her in months. Well, as I'm sure you've guessed by now the facebook message was from her. A few hours prior she had asked why he deleted her and he said he hadn't(lie), he didn't know how it happened(lie), and he's so sorry and he'll add her back(which he did). Then he told her they should start texting again like they used to(I checked his texts and there were none from her, but I'm sure he just deleted them before he went to bed). Before that there was an older message(and a bunch of gaps in the conversation where messages had obviously been deleted) from a few months prior before he moved in with me where she asked if she could come stay with him and him telling her it wouldn't be a good idea cause he ""wouldn't be able to control himself"".
I wouldn't say I wish I hadn't seen it because it exposed what a lying, cheating piece of shit he was, but it sure hurt to read. F’ing asshole."
"  passenger mistook car for a taxi. Driver realized she had dementia, gave her a ride, and had a pleasant conversation.




","Taxi drivers, has anyone actually jumped into your taxi and yelled “follow that car”? If so, what happened?

Not entirely related, but I once had somebody jump into my car and I wasn't even a taxi.
I was driving down the street in Boston and was stopped at a red light, minding my own business. Suddenly, my passenger door flung open and someone climbed in. Completely shocked, I didn't even have time to react. For some reason it never entered my mind that I should be alarmed or concerned about this trespasser, so when I saw that it was an elderly lady I just remained calm. Without skipping a beat, she said in a thick Russian accent, ""you take me home, please."" So, I started driving.
I asked where she lived but she just said ""keep going, I tell you when to stop."" At that point it dawned on me that she probably had dementia and that she likely thought I was someone she knew, or maybe even a taxi. Nope. After a few minutes of conversation it was abundantly clear that this woman had simply picked the first car she saw, gotten in, and requested a ride. During the 10-minute car ride she asked about my life. I was in college studying psychology at the time, and when I told her this she said ""you make good psychologist, very nice boy."" It put a big smile on my face. My grandparents had all died either before I was born or during early childhood, so I don't think I had ever had an elderly person say something like that to me. It felt nice.
Finally we reached an apartment building and she told me to pull over. When I put the car in park she turned to me and said ""thank you driving me today."" I assured her it was no problem at all and wished her the best, and her parting words to me as she climbed out were ""very good boy, good luck with studies."" After pausing for a moment, I drove away and just kind of let it be. It was such a nonchalant and comfortable interaction that I resisted my temptation to immediately text friends to tell them what had happened. It felt like that would have cheapened it, or turned it into a novelty. It was just so natural and I went with it."

One day when I was in high school, I arrived home to discover several mostly empty bottles of alcohol from my mother's liquor cabinet, sitting out on the kitchen counter. Upon hearing me enter the house, my mother angrily stomped into the kitchen to demand an explanation about why her booze was missing. I had absolutely no clue, but she wouldn't believe that my brother had denied drinking her booze. So therefore it must have been me. My mother threw a tantrum trying to get me to confess, which included yelling, screaming, hitting, punching and throwing things at me. Then she started hurling the other punishments. I was grounded. Any of my personal possessions that she didn't like, such as music she hated, was confiscated and many of them were smashed, destroyed and thrown into the garbage in front of my face. Then there were chores. I could expect to do nothing but clean from the moment I entered the house until I had to go to bed, until she felt I had learned my lesson. As it turned out, neither my brother nor I had anything to do with the paranormal disappearing alcoholic spirits. About three weeks later, one of her friends popped in for a visit. Let's call her Jan. I was mopping the kitchen at the time. Jan chuckled at seeing me mop and made a comment about how her kid never cleans. She asked my mother what her secret was. My mother told her about the missing alcohol and that I was being punished. Jan's face nearly hit the floor. Mouth agape. She reminded my mother that they had drunk the booze together during her last visit, about a month prior to this new revelation that I was, in fact, telling the truth. My Mommie Dearest very calmly stated. Oh, that's right, I forgot. Then turned to me and said, ""As soon as you're done with the floor, you can stop with the cheers for now. You're not grounded anymore."" And that was that. Of course, my mother never apologized to me."
"  crush rejection caused avoidance, but friendship prevailed. Friend found love elsewhere. Strong bonds and hope for children's friendship.","People who have the guts to ask their crush out. What happened afterward?

We were hanging out at our typical spot when I told her that I’d had a big crush on her for the past year and I’d really like it if she gave me a shot— just one date. 
She said *” Heh... nah. I don’t see you like that.”*
And then it was... *uh...* pretty effing weird. She tried changing the subject— but I was a million miles away by that point. I made up a reason to take off and she graciously didn’t call me out for it being bullcrap. 
I avoided her over the next few weeks. For some reason or another, her rejection humiliated me even though no one else knew about it. If she texted to see if I wanted to hang out, I wouldn’t respond or I’d lie and say I was doing something. 
One night, there was a knock on the door of my apartment. It was her. I knew she’d come around! 
I opened the door and she came in and sat down on my couch and said this [and I’m paraphrasing]:
*” I just don’t romantically like you. I can’t help it. I’m just not attracted to you. You just don’t spark my fire. I’m sorry.*
*That being said, I miss you. You’re my best friend and I spend pretty much all my free time with you. So if you want to go on a date with me, I’ll do that for you.”*
And I realized how much my friendship meant to her and how crappy and cowardly I’d been to avoid her after she rejected me. I told her that I was sorry— and if she could forgive me and see her way past this, I’d really like to resume our friendship. 
It wasn’t easy— but I was able to find the maturity to conquer those feelings. We picked up where we left off... minus a little baggage. A few years ago, a lifelong friend from back home came down to visit me. I introduced him to my friends here and... well... she found her spark. They’ve been happily married now for two years and I can only hope that their son and my daughter can enjoy the same level of friendship as she and I do."

"  person admits to fantasizing about having sex with a giant cockroach, confesses to girlfriend, leading to disgust and potential breakup.




","I admitted to my girlfriend that I pretend she is a giant cockroach when we have sex.

Ever since I was a teenager I have had very intense fantasies about having tango  with a giant roach.
It started in 9th or 10th grade when we read The Metamorphisis by Franz Kafka. As I started to think more and more about the roach creature that the character had become, I started to imagine what it would be like if a woman turned into the roach instead. I found this idea very arousing. I would not be repulsed or frightened of her, as the characters in the story are. I would take care of her. Then my thoughts started to get intimate with the character.
Eventually I sort of dropped the bit about her having been a human woman first, and I kind of imagined this fictionalized roach species. They are giant roaches, the size of a person, and have complete intelligence. I kind of over time conjured up an ""imaginary friend"" of sorts. She was one of these roaches and her name was Ogtha. I would fantasize about her often. Whenever I touched myself I'd be imagining elaborate scenarios of me and Ogtha making love.
When I started to have actual tango, I found I could not, uh perform, if I wasn't thinking of Ogtha. So basically now, anytime I have tango with a woman, I am pretending that she is actually Ogtha. Not just think about Ogtha, I concentrate intently to visualize that I actually am doing Ogtha. I don't want to think about the girl at all. There is only Ogtha.
Of course this tango can never be as exciting as my fully imaginary sessions with Ogtha, there are things that her multiple appendages and antennae allow for that a human woman can never match.
So anyways, I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for about a year. 3 or 4 times I have tried to have sex with her and not pretend she is Ogtha, but I just can't do it. So essentially every time we have tango I am imagining she is Ogtha.
I finally confided this to her the other day, and I was blown away by her reaction. I thought she might take it a bit badly at first but that she'd get used to it. No. I have never seen such a look of disgust before. Outraged is not an understatement. She is not even returning my texts now.
I am afraid she is actually going to break up with me and also that is going to tell people about Ogtha. I don't know how I will face anyone. This is going to sound silly but I also feel guilty about feeling shame, as if Ogtha will be saddened by this, even though I ""know"" she is imaginary. I just don't know what to do at this point."

She went through a period of depression after her mother’s death, so we began traveling, and doing so often, because she said that planning trips gave her something to look forward to and lifted her mood. In September of 2019 she met someone. I actually encouraged the relationship, knowing she was lonely and hoping this person could be a good fit. In October of 2019 my friend tells me she is not going on a trip to Mexico. This trip had been planned two years prior, and the dates finalized back in May. She’s not going, because the new significant other doesn’t like the idea. Fine, it’s a new relationship. It’s a bit of a strain on me, financially, as I paid for the resort and she was to pay for our flights, but I manage. In November of 2019 the significant other messages me on social media and basically attacks me. I’m told that I’m trying to break them up, that I’m being too needy by demanding my friend go with me, that I’m “retarded” (I hate that word), stupid, full of myself, the list goes on. All this is happening because the significant other believed I just set the dates of the trip to Mexico, and did so purposely to ruin their moving in together (which I didn’t know was happening). I ended up sending screenshots of the reservation dates in May, as well as my solo flight booked in October. No apology was given from the significant other once this proof was produced. Instead the comments became self-wallowing and an attempt to get sympathy. I never responded. I reached out to text my friend the next day. I felt we needed to talk about this. I received no answer. I texted several more times, and called over the next three days. No answer. I began to panic. Remember, my friend suffers from depression. Her mother committed sewerslide. I just knew my friend had hurt herself. Finally, I messaged a mutual friend who works with bestie, asking if she had seen or heard from my best friend. The message back: “Hey it’s Bestie, my significant other told me to block you on all social media and delete and block your number on my phone. But we’re good, you know?” For three days she let me believe the worst, and then just casually says we’re good. Nah. We’re not good. 40 years of friendship, and in an instant I’m completely cut off. I lost all respect for her immediately, and I haven’t spoken to her since. Too bad. I miss her, but it feels like she’s made her choice, and I’m not part of it."
  a person subtly messes with annoying coworker by pretending to have exclusive access to a specific brand of chili.,"What's you favorite way to subtly mess with people?

So when I was in college, I worked at a Target. There was an older lady who had been working there forever and the consensus was that she was highly annoying, so it wasn't just me. She would badger people about donating to her charities, she would tattle about parking violations, dress code, anything. Her whole life was that store and she didn't have many friends. When I started working there, I gave her a chance. Maybe she was misunderstood, lonely. I hung out with her a few times and realized why people kept their distance. I remained polite, though, until one day. I brought Hormel chili for lunch. Now, I know this sounds weird, but I (still, to this day) pick all the meat out. I only like the beans.
It takes me 45 minutes to do this, per can. I had my meal in my bowl and was eating it when she walks in. She asked me where I found chili with no meat, to which I told her I hadn't, I had to pick out the meat. I found out from a friend that later that day, in the breakroom, in front of a dozen other employees, that she said I was lying, there was no way I did that, and I was withholding where I got meatless chili on purpose, just to annoy her. So, the next time she saw me eating my chili, I apologized, and told her I got it at this one store, and that I just didn't want her buying any, because I wanted it all for myself. For about a year and a half, until I left, she would periodically come to me and tell me she just could not find that chili in that store anywhere. I would always tell her things, like, I think they moved it to the front, or it was on sale last week so they're probably out right now. I once told her they started only keeping it in the back and you had to ask. That week, she told me she got into a fight with a stock boy because he insisted they did not carry it.
I purposely went from eating it once a week to 3 times a week, yes, just to annoy her. 20 years later, I have no idea if she still believes me or not.

"  how people often make the Fundamental Attribution Error, attributing others' actions to their personality while excusing their own based on situational factors.




","What can I learn/know right now in 10 minutes that will be useful for the rest of my life?

When Sally got a C- on a test, you automatically assumed it was because she was lazy and didn’t care to study for it. But when you got a C- on a test, it’s because the professor didn’t teach the material well and the questions were way too hard.When Sally cut in front of you on the highway, you automatically assumed she was an arrogant,  obnoxious, and reckless driver. But when you cut in front of Sally on the highway, it’s because you had somewhere to go - your child’s graduation. When Sally arrived late to your meeting, you automatically assumed it’s because she simply doesn’t care about the company or your time. But when you arrived late to the next meeting the day after, it’s because your car was low on gas and you had to stop by a gas station. Notice a pattern? When something bad happened to Sally, you attributed that event to her personality. She did bad on a test? She’s lazy and not hard-working. She cut in front of you? She’s rude and obnoxious. She was late to the meeting? She’s disrespectful of people’s time. Little did you know that she did bad on a test because her pet just passed away. And that she cut in front of you because her child was in the hospital. And that she was late to the meeting because her car broke down.Yet when these same bad events happened to you, you attributed them to situational factors outside of your control. You did NOT attribute these events to your personality like you did to Sally. This is called the Fundamental Attribution Error. And many people make this error every day. You did bad on a test? Incompetent professor and impossible questions! You cut in front of Sally? So what - you had your child’s graduation to go to! You were late to the same meeting? Well, you had to fill up your car with gas! It takes less than 10 seconds to be aware that this kind of biased thinking exists, and that it’s an easy trap to fall into."
"  guy engaged in inappropriate relationships with his girlfriend, her parents, and even her brother, causing turmoil within the family.","Who’s Someone That’s Been A Menace To Your Family?

This happened a long time ago, back in my mid 20s. I knew a guy, a kind of casual friend, who was 21, and who had a girlfriend who was 17, still in high school. They had been together for about two years. (We'll call him Steve. Because his name is Steve.)
She lived with her mom, dad, and her brother who was about two years older than her and entering college. I'd met them, and hung-out over at their house a few times, so I kind of knew them, and they were really nice people.
So Steve used to be at her house almost every night. He, his girlfriend, and her parents would hang downstairs and watch TV for the evening, and then usually the folks would go upstairs to bed, and Steve and his Girlfriend would hang-out a while longer, and usually bang in the bathroom or on the living room floor. Normal stuff, really.
Now her dad was a transportation coordinator for a large company, so he spent a lot of time on the road. When he was home from the road he didn't go to the office too much, he usually worked from home. Sometimes Steve's Girlfriend would be tired and go to bed shortly after her mom, and her dad would be working on his computer at a little desk in the dinning room, and Steve would hang out on the couch watching TV.
Okay. Off to the races.
Steve was into computers, so he and the dad would look at new games a stuff on whatever latest and greatest machine work had given him. One night Steve's down on the floor plugging something into the power strip, and when he comes up on his knees he can tell that his Girlfriend's dad has a massive hard-on. The dad pulls his sweats down and asks if he likes that.
Most of us bail at this point, right? Nope. Steve starts sucking his meat, finishes the job, and goes home. So this becomes kind of a regular thing every month or so. He stays past Girlfriend and the mom going to bed, and he sucks-off the dad.
But wait! It gets better. He and the Girlfriend eventually move in together. One night he's dropping something off to his Girlfriend’s mom, and the dad's on the road. The mom is in just a house coat, starts putting the moves on him, and he takes her into the downstairs bathroom, bending her over the counter, and railing her. They start working this in when they can when the husband in on the road, and he can find a way to come over without the Girlfriend.
Oh, we're not done kids. Steve and his Girlfriend start hitting some rough patches. So he's over at the house talking to her brother. (Who I really liked, he was a cool guy, and fun to hangout with. I never really liked his sister too much,) and was talking to him about what was going on with the problems in the relationship. And Yep. They banged.
Now at this point you'd just be going: Okay, this is clearly the most messed-up family on the planet, because you just know they're all f ing each other. That house has got to be the Grand Central station of incest.
Nope. When it all finally blew-up, (and it did, in a big way,) it turned-out that the only one that knew about any of the other ones was Steve, the guy who had been having tango with every member of the family."
"  while intoxicated, the narrator unintentionally becomes involved in a racial profiling incident, records it, and diffuses tension through unconventional conversation.","How Did You Accidentally Become The Hero In Someone’s Story?

My friends and I had just gotten drunk and then really high, when we decided to go out for a walk near the beach. So, we start walking and smoking and getting higher. Suddenly, we see several cop cars and sirens go by. We freaked a little but they disappeared so we were chill.
Five-ish minutes later, we end up at the main beach street where we see some cops having pulled over a car. We’re curious to see what’s going, so we get a little closer—but not too close! We didn’t wanna get in trouble for public intoxication and the like.
However, as we get closer, I realize the couple the cops pulled over were a black man and woman, and I hear them answering the cops’ questions with confusion. I hear something along the lines of, “We got a report of some black people making a disturbance at a bar.” from one of the cops. The black man responds that they haven’t been anywhere near a bar tonight.
At this point, several thoughts happen in my high brain, the most important being that I had to be there for this couple and record, especially considering the ton of police brutality that had happened in recent news.
So, I walk up to the cops and couple, and start recording with my phone. I don’t say anything at first because I really didn’t know what to say, nor was I sure I’d able to given the chance. Then, as the cops tell the man and woman to sit on the curb while they check out their car, the woman notices me and the phone and thanks me for being there.
I’m trying really hard to form words and coherent thoughts and I say “No problem!”. Then, it’s silent as the couple sit on the curb and the cops start roaming through their car. Being high, I start to feel a weird mixture of paranoia and social awkwardness and I feel that it’s been ages since anyone has talked and I’m thinking I need to do something to ease the tension...
Then, I open my mouth.
“So,” I begin, then take a big breath that allows the rest of my words to stumble out together in such a way that not only surprises everyone, but also very obviously makes them aware I’m not sober. “Have y’all heard about the astronauts up in space? It’s kind of crazy like people I know have built the systems in place and technology to allow people to go to space. It really makes you wonder at how great the universe is and how we all need to be there for each other.”
They all look at me. The woman looks like she instantly regretted thanking me, probably wondering what lunatic would try and start a conversation like that in a situation as it was while being very obviously not sober.
Then, the man saves the day and starts joining my conversation and we find out we’re both from South LA, and a real conversation starts. Then, the cop asks if I can stop recording because he has a camera on him and it’s not necessary. But I persist. He gets defensive. The woman tries to defend me. Then they get into a heated argument.
I, again, feel extreme social awkwardness and start talking.
“You know, we all live in this world and it’s hard no matter what. We just all need to be here for each other. We all have our own families and shit we deal with. And I want you to know I’m here for you!! You know, in this world, we only have each other. We can’t let one another down.”
The cop and the woman look at me, this time in a weird combination of disbelief and relief. And the cop starts agreeing. And the woman starts agreeing. And then they both apologize to one another for the tense situation and shake hands. It was f ing crazy!!
Anyways, the cops end up admitting that they had the wrong people, even that they may have jumped the gun stopping them, and let them go. I stop recording after the cops pull away and the coupe leaves, and I head back to where my friends were waiting.
And I believed that I saved that couple, and that—just maybe—I had some unknown superpower that could erase racism and solve conflicts. Until I once again became sober, and realized the world sucks but if you ever wanna ease a tense situation, just make a fool out of yourself. It’ll confuse everyone else enough to get them to band together to deal with your weird lunatic shit."
"  forest ranger follows a mysterious dog, discovers human remains, and learns of the dog's connection to a grieving mother.","Forest rangers, what are your unexplainable and downright creepy stories?

We were getting calls about a lone wolf with a collar on hanging around campsites--weird, since wolves aren’t known to be in the area, but when you work in the field long enough you start to realize anything is possible. No calls had mentioned violent behavior from the animal, thank god.
I departed from the station around noon to check out the places that it’d been sighted. Wandered around for about three hours until I took a break for water. Sat down, had a snack, drank some water and was getting ready to go again when the thing was about twenty feet out, trotting near the treeline. It seemed friendly and had the collar, so I whistled to it and he came over to me. Getting a closer look, I could see it wasn’t a wolf. It was huge, but it was dark and didn’t have the right body structure, though I could see why it’d be confusing from a distance.
I radioed in and reported that I had the dog with me, but as soon as I said I’d bring it in, the dog took off. Like he was playing, to see how far he could get me to chase him. I went after it, and I swear it was a game of chase for at least five minutes as we steadily ran through the forest. The dog FINALLY slowed down near a rock bed/creek area, and started pacing around a spot. I drew closer and didn’t see anything off at first, then I noticed it the overgrowth had almost disguised what appeared to be bones. I called it in immediately, and another team was sent to recover the remains. When I went to retrieve the dog, he was just gone. But honestly, it wasn’t a priority at that point. He was friendly enough, and I figured we’d catch up with him later.
The bones were identified as a teenage male’s, died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He’d been reported missing in the area long before I became a ranger, and there’d been pretty much no hope of finding him.
I spoke to his mom on the phone, and she asked how I’d found her son. I mentioned the black dog, then thought I’d said something wrong since there was a pause on her side of the line. After I gave a couple details about the dog, she quietly explained that her son, who struggled with making connections, had sunken into a deep depression after the death of his best friend, the very dog that’d led me to him."
"  a man protests a dishonest car dealership in his town, gaining local fame and eventually receiving a settlement after being assaulted.","You have the ability to do absolutely nothing for an extremely long period of time. What is a way you can make Money out of it ?

There was a guy in my small town that started protesting a shitty car/RV dealership that ripped him off. He is a local legend. He just stood on the street corner with a sign, day in and day out, warning people not to do business there. He was polite. He didn't yell or block anything. He just stood on a curb with a sign that vaguely claimed that the car dealership was scummy. Later, he added a counter for how many days he had been protesting. He wore nice clothes and his hair was combed and face clean-shaven. He wore glasses. He had a cooler with drinks and food and would sometimes sit on it, eat a sandwich, and watch the traffic go by. His sign was well-written. His pants were ironed. He looked like an ordinary, respectable, good person who just had been ripped off and decided to fight it on principle - something everyone could relate to.
Salesmen at the dealership would go harass him. They'd call the cops, but he was within his rights. Then, one day, a shitty new salesmen tried to push him around. Apparently some customers walked away from a sale and this guy thought it was because of the one-man protest. He probably was right. I know that I would rethink buying a car if I noticed a dude with a sign outside that indicated he had been ripped off so badly that he decided to protest about it every day, all day long, for months.
Then that salesman slapped him, knocked him to the ground, threw his sign in the street, and kicked him. And it was all caught on video from multiple angles, because the protestor had cameras running. The protestor sued. They settled I think it was around $250,000.
Then he went right back to protesting, only now across the street for some reason. That dealership is out of business now."
"  husband discovers infidelity, children's paternity uncertain. Wife denies, brushes off concerns. Tragedy strikes as wife takes own life. Family shattered.","I just found out at least 4 of my 5 children are not mine. My Wife wont say anything.

I met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. We have 5 beautiful children together really, I consider them a total blessing regardless of what I'm about to bring up and up until a couple of weeks ago I thought that we had the perfect marriage. We were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, I feel like I've done everything a loving husband should do. I am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant I work long hours and maybe haven't always been there when she needed me, but I want to stress that I've never felt our marriage was in any trouble. And never in a million years would I ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal she's always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.
Now, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. And the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested I was not her father. She confided this to me privately, showing me the results and I could tell she was visibly upset by this. Of course, the first thing I did was reassure her that no matter what, she's my daughter and I'll always love her unconditionally. But secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. It comes back and I am indeed not her biological father.
This news really broke me. I'm ashamed to say I broke down in tears in front of my daughter. The combination of finding out about my wife's infidelity and how upset I was making my daughter by how I was reacting. I really wish I had kept it in for her sake, but I didn't.
Following this I asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. I wanted to know the extent of my wife's infidelity if it was a one off, I could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. However I didn't want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really I didn't think it was appropriate to tell her yet.
We tell the other three what has happened, I reassure them that I love them unconditionally and that I'll always be there dad, but that I need to know how long this has been going on. God, I can't begin to explain how touching their reaction was. They didn't care I wasn't their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken I was. I feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.
So we have paternity tests for each of the three done. Not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. Which somehow made it worse. It's like, she wasn't just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? I can't explain how this make it worse, but it just does.
So I confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. She doesn't confess. She doesn't even take it seriously. She says the tests must be flawed. All four? How the hell am I supposed to take that seriously?
I keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. When I bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. ""We've been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?"" and such. But how am I supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?
My kids and I confronted their mother shortly after making this post. It really didn't go well. I think the prospect that no one believed her finally hit home, because she completely broke down and apologized profusely, but refused to explain herself, or anything that would give myself peace of mind. For the next few weeks we barely said a word to each other; I was hoping she was thinking it over, and I expected her to eventually sit me down and explain herself. I figured she was so far deep in a lie that got out of control, she needed time to think things over.
Nope. I came home one evening to find she had committed suicide by overdosing. So I lost the love of my life, and I'll never know what mistakes she had made. I really wish I could go back in time and forget about it all. Whatever mistakes she made, I honestly wanted to work through it, and now I'm just riddled with guilt that I pressed her for an answer.
The worst part of this entire ordeal was watching my kids work so hard to keep me together, after having lost their mother."
"  reconnecting with a childhood friend revealed a heartbreaking story of abuse, addiction, and ultimately a tragic ending.","Have you ever reconnected with an old friend only to be horrified of who they've become?

Back in fifth grade, we had a new kid move into my town, let's call him Nick. Nick was pretty quiet at first, but he was pretty nice. I was assigned to him on his first day as his guide. We became friends and he slowly worked his way into the friendship structures of my school. He suddenly moved at sometime in the summer before seventh grade. We had no idea when because he moved out without a word to anyone and no one had his new address or number. It sucked at the time since he was a pretty cool kid, but eventually Nick faded from memory.
Cue freshman year of College. I'm home for thanksgiving break and I'm working at my Internship job at UMDNJ in Newark New Jersey. The crisis counselor (social worker whose job was to convince at-risk people to come in for treatment, rehab, counseling etc.) asked me to try to talk to this patient of his. This was a relatively common practice. Most people didn't want to talk to some stiff in a suit preaching rehab and the negatives of life on the street, so they send in younger folk like myself to try to make a connection. I was floored when I walked into the room and saw none other than Nick himself. He recognized me at once as well and said ""effing hell, Brain Ninja B"". (Brain Ninja B was a nickname from elementary school).  

Things went very well. At first we had talked about the old days and how he always knew I was going to make something for myself. Things turned dark when he told me what had happened to him over the years. He left my town when his mother ran with him and his brother from their abusive father. After that, things went bad very fast. They had no money and the father had destroyed all the mothers legal documents and papers, so she was stuck. Apparently, she went to a ""friends"" house for help but instead, he used her and pimped her out to his buddies. Eventually, that became a quick and easy way to make money and the mother became a prostitute. As one can imagine, that lifestyle and those crowds are not good for two teenage boys. Pimps, gangs, drugs and guns; life spiraled down for the entire family. The mother had a daughter not long after she began the whole prostitution thing and Nick's older brother joined a gang.
Eventually, when Nick was 15, he joined with his brother and you can figure out the rest. Money problems, shootings, drugs, rivalries. Nick and his brother dropped school, the mother was addicted to crystal, as many prostitutes are, and the little girl, let's call her Anna, was stuck in the middle of it all. Fast forward to the point in which I meet Nick again. He was just in a shootout in a gun deal gone bad, and his brother was killed in the crossfire. I convince him to give life up and come in for help. Surprisingly, it wasn't too hard to convince him. Family meant everything to him and the death of his brother was the last straw. 
When he came in for rehab, he came in with a passion. Dropped all drugs, cigs, alcohol and started studying for a GED. In less than 6 months, he was clean and he earned his GED b/c he was determined to make a change. That is when we found out that his mother contracted AIDS. 
Nick moved his mother and younger sister to an actual apartment that was setup by social services. He got a job, cut his mothers ties with the pimps and had her in rehab and sent Anna to school. Things were going great and we were all happy that everything was going as planned. But, if you know anything about gangs, you know that they do not take lightly to their own abandoning them like that. A little more than a year after I reconnected with Nick, he was gunned down in a drive by while walking his little sister home from school. Both Nick and Anna were killed from the wounds. This world is a cruel one; too many innocent people die due to the stupidity or hatred of others. In my field, people die all the time, it's a fact of life that we just learn to live with. But the phone call I received about his murder was particularly hard. Not only b/c poor innocent little Anna was killed as well, but the fact that Nick had such a hard life and was truly driven to turn everything around, to make something out of his life, only to have it cut so short. Whenever I go back home, I visit their graves. Earlier this year, the mother joined her three kids in the graveyard due to complications from her condition. It's truly a shame that this happened, but I think of it as an experience that has formed my personality. I feel as if I am a better, more mature person because of it. "
"  resourceful person fixes a broken fuel pump on their truck with a windshield fluid pump, enabling them to make it home.","What is the dumbest solution to a problem that actually worked?

My first vehicle was a 1985 dodge ram that had around 300k miles on it. Needless to say, it wasn't exactly reliable.
Anyway, my friend and I had tickets to go see a concert in a city that was about 3 hours away. We made it there just fine and had a blast at the concert. We couldn't afford to stay overnight so we started on the long journey home. If all went well, we would get home around 3AM.
There was one stretch of highway where there was 60 ish miles between towns. It's pretty much the worst place to break down on that journey. There were big signs warning travelers to fill up with gas before leaving town, but I had half a tank. My truck sputtered out and died almost halfway between the two towns. It sure sounded like I ran out of gas but the gauge still showed half a tank. All had not gone well.
So there we were - 1:45 AM, stuck on the side of the highway in Texas, 30 miles from the nearest towns, no moonlight, and this was before teenagers had cell phones. We were screwed. After a bit of poking around with a flashlight, we discovered that we did have fuel but the fuel pump had died. We decided to sleep in the truck and mess with it in the morning.
On those old dodge trucks, the fuel pump was inside the engine instead of in the fuel tank like a modern vehicle. It was powered by the engine instead of an electric motor. Essentially, the fuel pump would constantly pump gasoline when the engine was running and gas would always be available for the carburetor float valve. The extra pumped gas would just go back into the gas tank.
I was just drifting off to sleep when I got an idea. I worked for almost an hour in the pitch dark. I used some extra hose from an agricultural fertilizer, a drink straw, screw clamps, and duck tape to rig the windshield fluid pump to pump fuel from the fuel line into the carburetor float line.
I got in my truck, hit the windshield fluid lever, and the truck started right up. It took a bit of trial and error but I was able to get the timing down where I knew how often to hit the lever to keep the truck running.
We made it back home just after 4:30AM. My dad wasn't immediately amused with my handy work, but he told all of his friends how clever his son was so I guess it passed the dad test."
"  a parent uncovers online harassment of 8-year-old in Minecraft, finds harasser's dad, resulting in punishment for the harasser.","What is the most elaborate revenge you have ever carried out? 

So, my daughter, who was about 8 at the time, was REALLY into Minecraft and desperately wanting to join the Youtube/Let's Play culture, I had installed some screen recording software that would let her make videos of the games she was playing so she could later upload them to Youtube.
Anyways, one day I'm minding my own business when I hear her quietly sniffling over on the computer. I asked her what was wrong, but she didn't want to tell me so I let it go, but decided to keep on eye on her. A few minutes later I discovered what was happening; someone was harassing not only her, but also all the other kids playing on whatever server she was on. This kid (we'll call him Little Shithead, or LS) was saying shit about how he was going to s xually assault my 8 year old daughter (she told him how old she was hoping he would stop), how he was going to hack into her IP and steal all her info, swearing profusely (remember, this is a game for kids), etc etc. By this time I had gotten my fiance involved, and she was also obviously quite upset at what a little shit this kid was being. We realized that our daughter had been recording the entire incident, and a plan began to form.
I started by googling LS's username. There were several hits immediately, the most interesting of which involved a page where he was publicly applying to be a mod for a server on Minecraft. I was able to learn a lot about this little POS: he claimed to be 15, likes hockey, used to live in Toronto but now lives in Florida. But the bombshell was easily his skype contact info; it was literally firstname.lastname. I know your name now, you little shit.
So I head over to Facebook and search for the name. Nothing. Hmmmm. On a hunch I searched for just the last name, while narrowing my results to only the state of Florida. Several dozen hits. Hmmm. So I have to start combing through each one, until I find what I was looking for: a middle aged man with the same last name, whose profile indicates he was born in Toronto and now lives in Florida. I FOUND YOUR DAD, YOU LITTLE SHIT.
So I sent him a message on Facebook, asking if he had a son named firstname who goes by his username on Minecraft. Dad confirmed I had the right guy. So my wife begins telling the dad everything that LS was saying to my daughter, and we sent him the recorded video as proof. Radio silence for a few days.
Then we got the message back: LS had his computer taken away from him for the entire summer, and had also been lying about his age (he was only 11, I think). His parents were f’ing livid with him, and he surely hated the next few months of his life.
No one f’s with my daughter."

I had checked about 200 lines of weapons check-outs and in’s when at the bottom of the page(it has 50 on one side of the page) there was one entry in black. As you would imagine I found out who it was pretty quickly. Given the entry had his name and weapon number staring right at me.
Now the military has this thing where you go through ‘basic training’ for everything. I mean if you are given a pair of speakers, you are mandated to read the safety and usage instructions and give a signature for it, so they can’t be held liable to some degree.
This absolute piece of twig and sap looks at me with the most uncanny look when i confronted him about it. After a bit of friendly banter in-front of his whole room i ask: “So what is your excuse for using black ink?”.
“Sir, i’ve yet to get the formal safety and usage training for the blue pen, sir!”
He rewrote all 100 entries in blue pen that evening after being the only soldier to get training to use a blue pen instead of a black one. But man. That was a special moment where all the muscles in my face were fighting not to laugh."
"  stepmom caught a young man with child pornography during a home robbery, but let him go while arresting the homeowners.","Cops, what’s the most illegal thing you’ve seen someone do and been like “screw it. I don’t have the time for this.” And let them go about their business? 

My stepmom was a detective-sergeant for 17 years and one evening they were called to the scene of a home robbery. They arrive, there was only a young man sitting on the front steps, had his B and E bag beside him, a duffle bag full of stuff, and he has a laptop on his lap. He gave them all the stuff back and said he couldn't take it and then turned the laptop on. Apparently he had some kind of technology that can crack the login password to computers and he had gotten into the laptop. He found some of the most awful Child Pornography on the laptop. My stepmom couldn't and wouldn't go into details but she and the other officers on the case were required to attend therapy sessions when the case closed. The kid who robbed the house said he was just trying to wipe the computer and reset it so he could sell it so he could buy drugs but he said he didn't want to have anything to do with child pornography and he wanted the homeowners arrested. My stepmom was the senior officer on the scene and she let him go with a minor trespass citation and told him he had a good heart but he needed to clean his life up. The homeowners were arrested for the materials, and for the rape of their five year old child. "
"  stolen sodas, TI-83 calculators, RAM sticks, and compromised information fueled the thriving black market at the high school.","What was the black market at your highschool?

It consisted of sodas, TI-83 graphing calculators, RAM sticks, and the best for last - information.
Now I'm not gonna pretend that any of this is moral or legal. I would flip my shit if my kids ever do anything half as risky or illegal and I personally lead a completely different life now.
Sodas were a limited commodity. The Coke guy came twice a month. We had something like 8 machines on campus and all had Surge and Coke among others. We would put in coinage and pull the plug just after selecting the soda and it beginning to fall. Wait a second and plug it back in, the coinage would return due to the fault and the soda would come out as well. Rinse wash and repeat, sell the sodas for 75 cents (25cents off market price). Clean out the caffeinated selections incrementally over the weeks, hide the sodas in lockers. Never caught.
TI-83 calculators were stolen CONSTANTLY. I didn't steal them, but I did obtain them. 25 bucks a pop, 40 if you wanted all the games and WAV file playback.
Our school was quite new and had more computers than three neighboring school systems combined. Nice new Dell Optiplex desktops. In 10th grade my cohorts and I decided that constantly f’ing with the Novell Netware 3.0 system and making the admin run around with her hair on fire was passed and that we would turn increased productivity into a revenue stream. We took one of the two sticks of ram in EVERY single computer that a student would use. Many students only had computers at school. We then would sell sticks of RAM to students who complained of slow speeds when doing their shockwave presentations or when compiling programs at their assigned station etc... Never caught, sold out our inventory at 10 bucks a pop.
Information. Now this is dirty. We had access to everything on the network at a drop of a hat. Keyloggers had been installed on most computers and several teachers and administrators had been compromised. The network admins also had generated a user account for every single permutation of our student ID system that there would be for years, these NULL accounts were just waiting for someone to log in and set a password, this led to accounts used as repositories for pirated software and movies that we would sell access to. We also stole a set of records that had every single students schedule, home address, parental info etc... it was all in one huge binder and the library director and a few administrators were the only copies. Between all of these shenanigans we were quite well informed."
"  friend mocks and belittles person's stutter, revealing their true contempt and lack of empathy, leading to the end of the friendship.","What things have you learned about a friend that suddenly made you despise them?

I have a severe stutter and its always hard for me to make friends because if it. Luckily I had a really good friend. She never got impatient or mocked me, right?
Wrong.
I'm normally very quiet and when in a group of people its easy for people to forget I'm there. My friend, (we'll call her Julie) had a small get together at her house. During dinner, conversation was going on and someone asked my opinion on some random topic and I gave it, despite my stutter making it hard for me to say what I wanted.
Later in the evening I was sitting in the living room, sipping my scotch while Julie and some other guests were mingling in the kitchen. Someone casually mentions me in conversation and I hear Julie say, ""Ugh, why did you ask her that question? I can't stand it when she stutters everything. Like, just shut up and let the normal people t-t-t-t-talk.""
I sat there and listened to them laugh and make Porky Pig jokes and grew more and more hurt and angry. Someone said something alluding to my stutter meaning I was less intelligent and how Julie was such a good person for tolerating me.
I got up, walked into the kitchen and they stood there with a look of horror on their faces. Julie softly said, ""Oh god, I thought you left."" I left immediately and haven't spoken to her since."
"  a grieving mother, devastated by her son's illness and death, left personal notes before taking her own life, seeking solace in reunion.","People who were mentioned in someones life ending note, what’s your story?

A good friend of mine killed herself after her son died. She had always wanted nothing more in the world then to be a mother, and when her son was born we were all very happy for her. Two years later, he was diagnosed with a rare genetic illness that was some kind of muscular dystrophy. It was a very slow, very painful process and there was nothing she could do, only watch as her son slowly lost his just new found ability to crawl, talk and eat. After a year he was connected to all kinds of hoses keeping him alive. She had to feed him through a tube, his breathing through a oxygen hose was weak, and he looked miserable. After two more years at the age of four he died. We attended his funeral, we talked to her and through all this she seemed so strong. She never let anyone see her weakness. But on the funeral day, she broke down and cried and told us what hell she had been going through. She knew there was nothing she could’ve done to prevent this, that she wanted to be strong for her son even though he couldn’t open his eyes for the last months and how she sometimes wished for it to be over sooner, so he wouldn’t suffer so long. One of her other friends said that it will get better, slowly but eventually because she didn’t know what to say. None of us knew, except those set phrases. A week later she had killed herself, but not before writing a personal note to each and every one of her friends and her family, explaining how she could never get over the death of her child and that we shouldn’t be sad because she didn‘t end her life because she was sorrowful, but hopeful to see him again. We try to meet every year on her death day in a pub we used to drink, it‘s been 6 years since then."
"  how men often make conscious efforts to avoid appearing as creeps or pervs, while women may not think about it as much.




","What's something your gender does that the opposite gender never even thinks about?

What's something your gender does that the opposite gender never even thinks about? A lot of men try very hard to not seem like creeps or pervs, whereas I’ve never heard of any woman making any similar effort. For example, I am currently at the beach. Literally, I am sitting in a chair in the sand about 15 feet from the Atlantic Ocean. There are about 40 other people within eyesight on this beach, including a group of teen girls to the right of me who’ve been taking bikini selfies for about two hours. They’re hard to ignore, because they’re doing weird poses and giggling a lot. To the left, there are more women in bikinis. They’re sunbathing. So I’m making a point to keep my eyes on my laptop, the book I’m reading, or the ocean in front of me. I hesitate to look left or right, lest I get accused of being a creep. But, there are also a lot of scantily-clad men out here too. The women around me seem to have no problem staring at these guys. Older women, younger women, it doesn’t matter. When a shirtless guy jogs by (it happens a lot… there’s a Marine base near here), some of these women are downright shameless in their gawking. Imagine if a guy did that to a woman running by, especially if that woman was a generation younger than them. They’d be driven off the beach by an angry mob, accusing them of being a pervert. Yesterday, I was sitting on the deck overlooking the ocean, using my binoculars to scan the horizon. I was looking for dolphins or boats or whatever I could see. But, as soon as a family with teenage girls showed up on the beach, I put the binoculars down. Seeing a dolphin isn’t worth the risk of being thought of as a possible creep."
  how child-free people may experience loneliness in old age without kids. Building strong friendships and community connections can provide companionship.,"Will child-free people get lonely in old age without kids?

Will child-free people get lonely in old age without kids? Let me tell you a story. I have two sons. I love my boys more than anything. I have spent the last 20 or so years living my life around theirs— trying to support their interests, guide without controlling, accepting their challenges while celebrating their amazing individuality. On his 18th birthday, my older son talked to me on my way to bed. We laughed about some videos he’d been watching. Very normal chat. When my other son woke me a couple of hours later, my older son was gone, and I have not spoken to him since. It’s been six months. He’s alive and well and living in another state with some strangers. You probably think I’m leaving out the abuse or something. Nope. He just left. We got along great. No explanation, other than a short note that he wanted more independence— though, I never told him what to do, other than to go to school. By now, I’ve packed up his things. He’s gone. I don’t expect he’ll come back. That period of my life is over. Another story, just a month or so before my son left, my mother died. I spent her last months with her— changing her diaper, feeding her. She’d had a stroke the day after I’d brought my sons to see her after learning she was ill. I spent the next three months or so alternating with my brother, caring for her. One of our brothers, who lived nearby, did nothing for her. One managed her financial affairs. We traveled there from different states and lived with her. My point is that, maybe, if you’re reallllly lucky, your kids will be there for you at the end. Be nice to them. It’s the luck of the draw. Had my one brother been in charge, she’d have lived out her final days in a hospice, surrounded by strangers. Instead, I cooked her her favorite meals and watched Rocketman over and over with her for the first time. If you’re having kids for any reason other than the experience of raising children, you’re fooling yourself. They’re not an investment. They’re an experience. You should count yourself lucky if they call you now and then when they’re adults. It’s a crap shoot. I’d say focus on building friendships with people who will stick with you. Build a social life. Get involved in your community. If you want kids because they’ll “have to take care of you when you’re old” save yourself a LOT of expense and hassle and make some good friends instead. It’s a better bet."
"  a marriage ended abruptly when he demanded a divorce, revealing infidelity and lack of consideration, prompting her to secure her future.","How did your marriage end? 

He came home from work, ate dinner, and said , ““I want you to do something and I don’t want you to fight me on this. I want a divorce.” I was completely blindsided. Then he packed a bag and left for his mother’s house. I made him leave his key. He didn’t understand that, ““how will I get in the house?” I replied that he had no reason to enter the house when I wasn’t home. He didn’t live there anymore. He was shocked. I started thinking about his infidelity and the micro-aggressions that had recently increased; for Christmas he had given me a bottle of men’s cologne! That’s it. Of course, he kept it for himself. It was evident that he had given my gift absolutely no thought. So instead of begging him to stay, I emptied out the joint accounts and made an appointment with a family attorney for the next day. Of course he wanted to drag things out. He came to get his things the same week, and I watched TV while he packed and loaded the car. He actually asked me to help. I said “This is something you want to do, not me.” Before he left, I told him that I know he is still committing adultery and that my attorney said he should be careful about that. Lots of denying and sputtering but the thing that bothered him most was my getting a lawyer. He actually said “You got a lawyer? You know I will always take care of you. Don’t you trust me?” By the way, he told me the reason he needed space was “the children are grown now, so I don’t have to pretend anymore. I never wanted a family that I had to hang out with.” So that was the end. A year later, a judge granted me about a third of his assets and income as alimony until I remarry or die. We were married 32 years, and I was 65 years old. I’m sitting pretty comfortably and very peacefully in a different city. Except for incidental paperwork handled by my attorney, I have no contact. I don’t have to pretend anymore, either."
"  inheriting her wealthy parents' estate, daughter faced conflicting emotions when pressured by their preacher to donate to the church.




","What would you do if your rich parents gave your entire inheritance to charity?

I can sort of answer this. My parents hated me and resented my being born and ruining their lives. I moved out of the house when I was 17 1/2, the day after I graduated from high school, and never expected to hear of or from them ever again. After about three years, I heard from an attorney who told me that my parents had died and since they didn't have a will, all their money was now mine. I really didn't want anything from them but I took the money and put it in a savings account and didn't touch it for years, except for one occasion to pay for some large medical bills, because it just felt ""dirty."" What prompted me to accept the money was a visit from their preacher, whom I had known when I was still living at home and saw every weekend when I was forced to go to church. He showed up a few weeks after the attorney contacted me and said that my parents had pledged their estate to the church asked if I would honor their wishes. This is the same church and preacher that I'm sure knew about the physical abuse I survived through for most of my life. They probably didn't know about the mental abuse I received, but had to know about the physical. He was adamant that the church should receive all the proceeds from their estate and threatened legal action if I didn't turn everything over to the church. He told me of all the glorious things they were going to do with the money and what a difference it would make in so many people's lives, but what he failed to mention was how much it would do to his life. I was living in a little crappy ass apartment, and had struggled to put myself through one of the most expensive colleges in the country, doing any kind of job that would help me pay the bills and get my degree. When he showed up, he arrived in his new Rolls Royce, with his new Rolex and fancy suit and all that was going through my mind was, ""How much of this money is going to support your lifestyle, and how much is actually going to help people?"" I was very conflicted. I really didn't want to have anything to do with them or their money, and while it could really change my life, it just felt wrong to take it. I knew that, no, it wasn't my inheritance, it was theirs to disburse however they wanted, and while I did believe the preacher that they wanted it to go to the church, the youthful rebellious part of me wanted to kind of wanted to ""stick it to my parents"" and deny their wish. I knew they'd be furious that I got their estate, and that certainly felt like sweet justice for the many times I ended up in the hospital with concussions and broken bones. The more adamant the preacher got that the church should get the estate, the more certain I was that they wouldn't see a cent of it. I didn’t touch the rest of the money for over 10 years, and then I started donating it to charities I chose."
  a doctor's gut feeling about scared patient confirmed abuse; girl's rescue led to her transformation and a happier life.,"As a doctor or nurse, did you ever have a scary gut feeling about a patient that turned out to be true?

One evening a young woman came in, name was Charlie, to the emergency department with her dad. I thought it strange as she was 24 but her dad came in with her. He did most of the speaking for her and as I listened to him I saw the look of horror on her face. She looked petrified and was trembling. Hospitals can be scary but not that scary. I had a horrible feeling here and prayed to the heavens it wasn't what I thought it was. It was told to examine the girl. I told the dad he had to go, which at first he refused and got pretty aggressive but eventually he did go but before he did he said to the daughter 'I'll be right outside' and he didn't say it very nicely either. So I began the examination. At one point I asked her to take off her top, she said she was having chest and stomach pains. She was reluctant. 'Do I have to?' she asked me. I smiled and said. 'If you want to get better then yes.' She smiled weakly and laughed a little. She lifted her t shirt and my god what I saw was absolutely horrific! Her breasts were red, bruised and cut. Her stomach was the exact same. My jaw must have dropped because she nervously said. 'How bad is it?' I explained to her the injuries and that some needed stitches. She looked worried. 'My dad won't like that' I immediately asked. 'Was this your dad?' She was silent. Just standing there shifting uncomfortably. I decided to tell her about my childhood and teen years. I told her how I had been abused by a family member for years and how bad it had got where he wouldn't even let me out of the house. I told her that she shouldn't and didn't have to live life like this anymore. I told her if she pressed charges she would be free and her dad wouldn't be able to hurt her anymore. I asked her to trust me and said. 'I am living proof that you can turn your life around and be happy and treated properly again' What did she do? Well my gut feeling was sadly right but it resulted in a happy ending. The girl, her name was Charlie, she called the police from in the room and the dad was arrested and eventually charged and sent to prison, good riddance to bad rubbish! Charlie had some bad injuries. Including broken bones. She made a full recovery and I am so pleased to say that later on that year she came back to see me and thank me and honestly the difference was amazing! Charlie was happier, almost glowing. She was also training to be a nurse, yay and here's the best bit... She is now trained and I have worked with her many times. My gut feeling was correct but I am so glad Charlie came in that night because it meant I got to help her and now she is happy and enjoying life again. I truly helped this girl and am proud to say I helped change her life for the better."

I could tell that these were definitely the real deal.

I thanked him and placed them in my desk drawer that had a lock. On my lunch break, I called his mom and explained the situation. She was a realtor and worked near the school. She dropped by and confirmed that those were her diamond earrings, and I, of course, returned them to her. She told me she would handle it gently at home. The next day, the same little boy came in with another gift for me. He insisted that I open it right away. It was a little angel figurine (from the Dollar Store). He told me that his mom let him know that I was married and couldn’t accept jewelry from him and that he shouldn’t have taken his mom’s jewelry. She took him to the Dollar Store and let him pick out one item that he thought I’d like. He picked the angel “to protect me from the bad kids.” (I had a few kids that year that really acted out in class!) I kept that angel on my desk for the rest of my career!"

She was crying and we took her in. This is horrible behavior but my husband and I would have just cut them off if it was all they did but they doubled down. They refused to hand over any of the documents and my Brother in Law had to go over and barge into their house to get them.

They were trying to ruin her life as much as they could. My father in law is a small time businessman and his biggest account was supplying my employer. I had helped him get the contract and it was very lucrative for him. My employer was I family business and they treated long term employees more like family than as employees. I was talking to my boss about what happened. He told me that if I could find someone within 5% range of the price my father in law offered. They would make the switch. My father in law offered us really great rates, He was very good at his job but he had effed up the contract because even though we always brought from him, We weren't obligated to buy from him, we could switch suppliers anytime but he got complacent and assumed we wouldn't switch suppliers. It took me six months of painful searching to find a supplier who could replace him and get us great rates. This was not a major part of my duties and I had to put in way more hours than normal to find the damn supplier but when I did find them, I waited for a month before informing my boss. See, My in laws had been planning to do major renovation for a long time and it involved tearing down a major portion of their house. I waited until the renovation work had truly started before informing my boss. we started to get supplies from the new supplier the next month itself. It crushed his business. It effed his unit economics and he had to scramble to find new customers. They ended having to sell their house to save the business and they didn't get a good rate for it because the house was well half torn down when they sold it. My In laws did try to get money from my brother in law but he told them to f off. My father in law is a decent business man and he did crawl his way out of the hole they dug for themselves but even 8 years later they still haven't bought a new house. I have heard they are still sour about what happened. I mean, I was just doing my job and if they had just kicked her out, they would still had the house."

"  person advises their niece (17F) to stay in the closet to inherit millions from homophobic grandparents. AITA for this suggestion?





","AITA for telling my niece to stay in the closet so she can become a millionaire?

My (42M) niece (17F) recently confided in me that she is a lesbian. I supported her, let her know I'd be there, etc. Usual ally stuff.
However, she told me she was going to come out to the whole world this week. I let her know she should absolutely wait for her grandparents (my parents) to pass. My father is incredibly wealthy and has tens of millions of dollars in assets that he will be passing down once he is gone.
My father is a raging homophobe who has flat out stated any gay individual in our family would be written out of the will. And to make sure the rest of us don't just split more money with said gay relative, they will, instead, have that portion of the inheritance (put aside for that family member) donated to charitable causes. That money will be erased from the inheritance.
Since both my father and mother are in incredibly poor health, (stage 4 cancer and debilitating dementia respectively) I told my niece she should stay in the closet for a while longer. If she comes out as a lesbian and they find out, she will quite literally lose out on 7 million dollars.
She was a little sad but was also appreciative since that is obviously a life-changing amount of money that will allow her to live luxuriously until she dies.
My wife, however, said that I am being an asshole. I am telling this poor girl to hide who she is just to appease old bigots. That is true, I am asking her to appease old bigots. But I feel like her life quality will be much better with 7 million dollars at the cost of 1-2 years in the closet at the top.
I have also seen my father's will and know who is getting what, so my niece IS definitely going to receive 7 million as long as my father doesn't rewrite or edit his will.
Am I the asshole for telling my niece to stay in the closet so she can be a millionaire?"

Birthdays in my family are very important, we throw huge parties, I believe and have been taught that birthdays are important and should be cherished.
Yesterday was my birthday. Obviously I felt bad about the anniversary of my nephew's death, but I was also a little down about not being able to celebrate like I used to and my girlfriend knew that.
In the morning, I went to Denise's house, stayed by her side until almost lunch time, when my mother would stay with her (we didn't want to leave her alone, but no one could stay all day).
I went to work and at night, my girlfriend made a surprise at home with a candlelight dinner and a small cake. Something very intimate and for both of us, since my family was in a bad way.
I didn't post on social media, but my girlfriend posted a picture of us holding hands and the dinner she made with ""Happy Bday, Love"". My mom and Denise follow her on Instagram.
I woke up the next day to hundreds of texts from my mom and Denise, asking if I was celebrating even though it was such a sad day and how heartless I was to celebrate knowing my sister was in such a bad way.

What was your most heartbreaking goodbye? I was at the airport after visiting my girlfriend in England for the first time. She is British, I'm Canadian and we met online through a mutual friend and immediately clicked. I was only 18 at the time and had no idea how I was going to fly to Europe to meet her. Eventually, after 18 months of online dating I managed to save up enough to stay in the UK with her and her family for a month. It was one of the most amazing things I've ever done. Visiting London and seeing the sights was incredible and first meeting her in the airport was such a relief. Seeing her not as a picture in my phone, voice in my headset or face on my computer chat but as a real person lead to so many emotions. We did everything together and were inseparable and her family loved me, just like I loved them. They were so great to me and I'll never thank them enough. Eventually the time came and I had to leave. The final few days of the trip turned from excitement and happiness to curled up in bed watching movies and lots of crying. It was heartbreaking holding her in her room and assuring her that I would see her again but the truth was I couldn't guarantee that. This trip cost me thousands of dollars and I had no idea when or if I would ever see her again. Squeezing her hand at the airport and comforting her took all of my emotional energy and I nearly broke but I had to be strong for her. She needed me to be her rock and I did the best that I could. Once luggage was checked and I had to go through security that was when the sobbing really started. Forcing myself to walk away from her as her parents took her sobbing back to the car was one of the hardest things I've done in my entire life. Long distance is brutal and I don't wish it on anybody. I know I wouldn't do it again. I managed to go twice more. I spent 6 weeks in England the next year and then flew again before Christmas to propose. We've been married for nearly two years now and she's the love of my life. She lives with me in Canada because it was easiest for us while I finish my degree but if she wants to move back home then I'll follow her anywhere. It's the least I could do."
"  overweight child exploiter posed as friendly, preyed on young men, invaded personal space, and abused his own children. Disgusting and evil.","Ex Prisoners, who was the most evil person in prison?

There was this dude who was into the exploitation of children (we call them Chomo's in prison) who was in his 50's, overweight disgusting redneck with creepy glasses. He was in there for continuously forcing himself on his children, ranging from ages 4 to 13. Daughters and sons both. (In prison, he was always staring at other men and buying guys stuff and yes there are young guys dumb enough to buy into his act and end up getting forced on, although they more or less let him do it, I knew one guy who was pretty normal but addicted to dope and Bob, that's the chomo's name, offered him dope to let him sleep with him.)
So the story goes that a couple of guys were out hunting and saw this creeper van and a little camp set up and could here crying coming from the van and it was moving so it was kind of suspicious to them and they approached the van and opened it up and there was Bob, with his daughter while the other children cowered in a corner with blank stares. The men pulled him off and started to call the police and this piece of crap started crying and shouting at them that ""they're my kids, I can do what I want with them!"" Obviously, they were disgusted and hurt him, one of them actually got charged with assault when the police got there because Bob pressed charges, the police had no choice.
The worst part is that this piece of trash acted like the friendliest neighbour you ever saw in prison, all smiles and going to church and preaching God's word to people, the whole while being a weirdo on young white men in there, having intimacy as often as he could. Everytime I caught him staring at me I'd feel disgusted and mean mug him.
Before I knew who he was, he would always say hi to me and I would think ""who is that, why is he always saying hello"". One day I got sick of it and told him he didn't know me and to stop trying to greet me. I could tell he was a chomo but wasn't sure, then one of my friends told me the story and guys from his county had the newspapers to back it up. 
Also, he was very handy. Every person he ever talked to he would put his hands on any chance he got. He was in my pod for a week and I was at the microwave and he touched my back between my shoulders to ask who was behind me. That's when I angrily told him not to touch me and you don't know me and also stop trying to talk to me. I don't like you."
"  New Wave goth girl retaliates against a bully, beating him with a desk, and receives surprising support from the bully's father.




","People who have snapped on a bully at school, what's your story?

I was a goth chick. It was 1987, I was 14. It was a great time to be goth, but I thought of myself as New Wave. I was new in school. So I got double bullied. Weirdo with a funny accent. There was this asshole 17 year old sophomore. Total loser, waiting till he turned 18 so he could drop out. He had this red Impala, the thing was red. Rims were red, hubcaps were red, windshield wipers were red. Antennae was red. He was a big bully, bullied everyone, all day every day. People just took it and didn't make fun of his car, because he was way bigger than his classmates. I had just gotten out of a particularly bad gym class. People threw rocks at me and my friends, calling us witches as we walked around the track. I was in a mood. In English class after gym, this guy is sitting right behind me. I was wearing an echo and the bunnymen t shirt, and this dude dropped his pencil. It rolled up on my foot. When I reached down to pick it up to hand it back to him, he said ""Hey, Bunnyman, that's my pencil, don't you touch it."" Boy, did I snap. I picked up his desk, the one he was sitting behind, and I proceed to wail on this guy with that desk. Up over my head beat him with it. Screaming ""I never did anything to you, you drive a car that looks like my time of the month!"" And I hurt him until he was on the floor and crying. A bunch of people pulled me off of him, and an ambulance was called. People cheered, I was told. I saw nothing but rage. The next day, my dad and I were sitting outside of the guidance counselors' office. Dad is telling me this is it, I'll probably get kicked out of school, maybe start my arrest record today. When we meet the guy and his parents, his dad was freaking 7 feet tall, I swear. And he told his son to shake my hand and thank me for kicking his ass. He was lucky to be getting his ass handed to him by a girl, it would teach him to lose the attitude before someone else out in the real world taught him the lesson. Most likely in prison. Dad was right, the kid was killed in jail before he was 30."
"  man unintentionally finds himself in a brief, friendly encounter with a gay man at a dance club, causing confusion and amusement.","I was accidentally gay for an hour

I'd taken my girlfriend and her two gay friends to a dance club. They were dancing, while I was at the bar, having a drink. A guy sits down next to me, and asks what I'm drinking. I tell him it's some hipster small batch thing, and he orders two, and slides one over to me, thanking me for the recommendation. ""Great, next round's on me"" I think. We get into a good conversation about work and the city. I finish my drink, hit the washroom, and when I get back, there's another beer there for me. I thank him again, and we continue having a great conversation. As I finish my beer, and am about to order another, he grabs my hand and asks me to dance. Now, I could have said any number of things. Things like ""I'm straight"" or ""I'm not gay"" or ""I'm here with my girlfriend"". What do I blurt out? ""Oh, no, I don't dance."" Then like a scene out of a rom-com, he says he's a dancer, and he'd be happy to show me a few moves.Now, as I'm being led onto the dance floor, my girlfriend is nowhere to be found. My first thought is ""This guy seems really nice, crap, I don't want to lead him on, but he's really nice."" At this point, my girlfriend comes in with her friends, laughs, and asks me ""What's going on?"" ""I'll explain later."" I said, as I danced with a good looking Asian man. ""Was that your friend?"" He asked. ""No, that was my girlfriend."" ""OK. Then what exactly are you doing?"" ""I don't know anymore, but you're really nice!"" He laughs it off, says I'm a good guy, and leaves my girlfriend to bring my intoxicated ass home."
"  soldier's act of kindness backfired when a girl's muffin was stolen, leading to revenge by offering the thief a bottle of urine.","Retired soldiers, what was something that you experienced that you never shared?

I was in Iraq for 7 months doing convoy security. We would drive all over the country delivering supplies and personnel wherever we were ordered too. It wasn't uncommon for all the kids of smaller villages to run along and road side asking for muffins or Gatorades or any other thing they could.
At first we would regularly throw snacks to them. It was cool seeing their smiling faces after they caught a chocolate muffin or a fruit punch Gatorade. We'd feel like Santa Clause winning the hearts and minds of the younger generations. Winning the war on terror one muffin at a time. But of course things changed.
Another unit had an accident and a couple kids got hurt basically trying to catch snacks being thrown to them. So our new standard of procedure was to not give out anything whatsoever in order to keep the kids from grouping around our vehicles as we'd roll through their towns. This didn't stop them from gathering and it almost made them more desperate in their attempts to get anything from us. Even asking for water, which was something they would actually reject when we were throwing snacks at them.
So we're rolling through this city at a painfully slow speed. Reports of IED’s being found nearby recently coupled with all the civilians who lined the road made us extra careful not to drive over anything or anyone that would compromise the safety objective of our mission. As I'm scanning the road and people ahead of me I spot this adorable little girl halfway hiding behind her fathers leg as she stares at us with her big green eyes. She must have been around 4 or 5. I knew we werent supposed to give them anything anymore but my heart melted for her so I handed the man beside me a muffin and asked him to toss it to that little girl and he did.
Her father got this huge smile as he gave us a thank you wave and the little girl, excited that she got a muffin, ran up the road to show another group of kids her snack when this boy who had to of been at least 12 just shoved the little girl and snatches her muffin away. My whole truck was mad!
I was livid as it was a very violent shove and the little girl exploded into tears as she sat there in the dirt muffinless. As we continued to roll towards the group of kids I handed the guy beside me my pee bottle and told him to toss it to that same kid. It couldn't have been more perfect. As we got closer to the group he turned to the trucks with his mouth full of muffin and started motioning for us to throw him something so we obliged.
He greedily ran away from the rest of the group of kids that were trying to wrestle the bottle from him. Being bigger than all of them it wasn't much of a struggle so as he's jogging away we see him open the bottle then take a huge swig from the bottle before spitting it out and throwing the bottle to the floor. As we drove by him he was still doubled over spitting and dry heaving."
"  Valentine's date ends in disaster as girl gets injured, leading to unexpected friendships and a messy love triangle.","Waiters, what Valentine day disasters have you witnessed?

I am a bartender but happened to be the one on the date for this particular disaster.
So anyone in the service industry knows, you generally just do not make plans on certain holidays because you will have to work, no matter what. I had not had a date on Valentine's in probably 7 years, so when my boss gave me the day off I was surprised and posted something dumb on insta about it. I got a DM from a girl I knew but not very well, asking me out for Valentines and she was way cute so I figured why not.
Things went so wrong, so quickly. We get to the restaurant, grab a drink in the bar while we wait on our table, and take a shot to get the social lubricant flowing since we don't really know each other very well. I pay our bar tab, and we move to the table.
The moment we sit down, my date lets out a blood curdling scream like she had just been seriously hurt. She grabs her arm and her hand comes away covered in blood, and she looks so confused and I have no idea what just happened. I look around thinking someone just did this intentionally her but everyone around us is seated just staring over at us. I move over to her side of the booth and grab the napkins off the table to find where she is cut. The entire back of her upper arm is wounded from elbow to shoulder. One of the buttons had broken off of the wall and the snapped metal fastener was exposed so when she sat down her arm ran all the way down along it.
She is panicking, I am trying to stop the bleeding, while the people around us figure out what is going on and call 911 for us. The manager comes over and is immediately a defensive dirtbag until he sees that it was his booth that did the damage. The paramedics show up, I get the owner's info from the manager, and we spend the night in the ER where she needed something like 80 stitches.
We both are exhausted at this point, when a guy walks in with flowers, champagne and a bag of takeout food from the restaurant we had left. It was the owner of the restaurant coming to make sure we could have the Valentine's meal we had missed out on. Sure it was probably because he was afraid to get sued but it was still really welcomed after how bad the night had become, so quickly.
She and I ended up dating for almost 3 years and became good friends with the owner. Such good friends she ended up sleeping with him and that was the last I heard from either of them. "
"  tragic love story unfolds as two best friends navigate loss and make a pact, only to be torn apart by fate.","Have you ever lost your soulmate?

We met in college, and were instant best friends. I was 20; she was 18. We spent all our time together, and were briefly lovers, but we never formally dated because both of us were very much into being wild and free and enjoying our youth. We dated other people on and off, but we talked about it and agreed that a committed relationship between the two of us would be an all-or-nothing kind of thing. Since neither of us wanted to give up our hedonistic, promiscuous, irresponsible lifestyle, we made a point of not committing to a relationship. A few years went by that way, and we were very happy, right up until her sisters died.
It was a car accident. They were 16 and 18, and both were killed in the crash. Dead on arrival at the hospital. My friend was utterly, completely devastated. It still hurts me to remember it, even now. Her father, though, was even more devastated, to the point where he was legitimately willing to let himself starve to death rather than try to go on living. She moved home, out of state, to take care of him. She cut ties with everyone for awhile, even me. I didn't see her again for two years. She was so different after that. Before the accident, she'd always been the most joyful, exuberant, positive person I'd ever met. After she came back, she was quieter, sadder, maybe wiser. I wanted to be there for her more than I'd ever wanted anything in the world. Not being able to fix things for her, not being able to make it better, that hurt more than anything I could ever remember. I guess that's when I realized how in love with her I was.
I told her that I loved her, that I wanted to be there with her, and she told me that she couldn't handle the idea of any kind of emotional connection for awhile. Maybe a few years, she said. Maybe never. Maybe she'd never be able to open up emotionally again. She said she needed space from me, particularly from me. She said she needed to figure out what it meant to be alive in a world where her sisters were gone. She asked me to give her time, and I told her that I'd give her anything she wanted. She told me that she'd never been happier than she was when we were together. I told her the same. I told her that I understood, and that's when we made our pact. I was 25 then, and she was 23. We agreed: if she turned 30 and I turned 32, and if she had learned to heal, and if she hadn't fallen in love with someone else, and if I hadn't fallen in love with someone else, then we'd get married. So that's how we parted ways. She moved to Wyoming, to be alone. I moved to Germany, to get as far away from her as I could. We didn't keep in touch at first, but over the next few years we built up a correspondence. We wrote letters because we both liked writing letters. We emailed now and then. Sometimes we'd mail each other books that we thought the other would like. Years went on, and we became closer and closer. When I turned 30, I half-jokingly brought up our marriage pact. I told her that I hadn't ever fallen for anyone else. (I didn't mention this, but I couldn't have fallen for anyone else. I always compared every other woman to her, and in my memory she was perfect.) She replied that she was still very serious about our agreement, and that she'd never fallen in love with anyone else either. I asked her if she thought she had begun to heal, and she said she had, as much as a person could ever heal from something like that. A year later, she told me she'd like us to meet and spend some time together, to see if the spark was still there. It was. She was living in California at that time, and I found a job there. I'd always wanted to live in California anyway. I proposed to her six months later, and she smiled and told me ""no fair"", that I had to wait another few months, when she'd be turning 30. I thought it was silly, but at that point things were going so well that a few months didn't seem like they could matter at all. But I'm crying now, so I'll have to wrap this up quickly.
She died. That's how the story ends. She was hit by a drunk driver and spent 2 days in the ICU before her body gave out. I went to her funeral. I spoke to her father but I barely remember what we said. I've never spoken to him since. I don't have the willpower to make myself find out how he's doing. That will be four years ago this November. I'm in therapy and trying to learn how to have feelings again, other than blank, mindless, miserable rage. I often wonder if this is what it felt like for her. She made progress. She learned to feel again. That thought is what keeps me going. She did it. She'd want me to do it.
That's it. That's the story. It's a shitty story, and I hate it."
"  therapist was horrified to learn about the elementary school's practice of locking students in tiny closets, and called the police.","What is the worst thing a therapist has ever said to you?

“That’s called solitary confinement. I’m calling the police right now!” My family’s counselor said this when she discovered my elementary school was locking up myself and several other students in tiny closets every day.
When I was younger, my sister and mom weren’t getting along and mom decided we’d see a family counselor. Most of my time with the counselor was easy going, happy, and short as I had nothing to do with my sister and mother arguing and screaming at each other all the time.
That was until she asked me how school was going and started digging in to what my daily life was like. In 5th grade, I was caught trying to out one of my female teachers for verbally mistreating students and cursing at us too. She used to get a rise out of berating one particularly sweet and timid girl in the class. Well, the teacher caught me recording her cursing and sent me to detention for the rest of the year.
Detention is three small rooms behind the principal’s office, with room for just one student in each closet-sized cell. They would lock us in and the only time/s we were allowed out was for lunch or to join other classes for “wall sits” in the middle of Arizona summers - we had to knock and ask to use the restroom, which was located in the principals office area too - so no chance to see other students. Usually, one of the “small rooms” (as we called them) was occupied by a mentally challenged student who would scream and bang his head on the wall - poor kid had no clue why they were locking him in a tiny room. Oh and if any of us were really bad, they’d turn the lights off on us until whoever was acting up would shut up. This usually made the screaming guy go berserk until he hyperventilated and passed out.
Countless days spent plugging my ears and holding back tears. I eventually gouged out a small hole under the desk, which was permanently attached to the walls. I disassembled pens and would wrap a note around the ink cartridge, then pass the note and pen through the wall to whoever was on the other side.
This lasted for a large part of that grade, but they eventually found the pen hole and punished all of us with more wall-sits in the sun while watching everyone else play at recess.
I don’t know who these people were running the elementary school, but this stuff changed my perception of the world quickly - I thought I could trust anyone with authority, but after this - I pretty much laugh at anyone that thinks they have some sort of “power”, “authority”, or “seniority” over another human being."
"  undercover cop gained gang's trust with fearless acts, surviving beatings, and unwavering commitment, leading to their ultimate capture.","Former gang members, how did you get caught?

We fell prey to an undercover operation. I feel obligated to preface this with how amazed I am at how integrated this man was in our gang. If giving an Oscar worthy performance is the standard, I have to say, I'm pretty impressed by what you guys can do. Over the course of several months, this cop earned our trust. Hell, at one point, I would have said that I trusted that man more than my own brother, who was also in the gang. To be fair, I caught my brother stealing products from us more than once, but I trusted him to not directly destroy my livelihood. Suffice to say, this cop's acting skill was one of the number one factors that led to us getting busted.
This man, let's call him Dave, was absolutely fearless and tough as nails. One of our initiation rituals involved letting members of the group wail on you for three minutes, no holding back. If you were still breathing afterwards, you were in. After getting pummelled to the ground by seven or eight different men, Dave wasn't just alive. It was almost as if he enjoyed it.
To get to the craziest thing Dave did, I need to explain how our gang functioned. We start off being referred to as a number, both to protect identity and as a form of putting lower ranked members in their place. Names had to be earned. We didn't exactly have a set criteria for earning a name, but members often had to bring in enough income for the gang, earn the leader's trust, and commit various violent acts for the benefit of the group before a name was even considered. All names followed the same theme: Astronomy. Our leader was known as Vega.
The day Dave earned his name, Vega had him as a getaway driver for a group of members. Their job was to sneak into a rival dealer's house, steal his product, and escape in Dave's car. As they were making their getaway, someone opened fire on the vehicle and Dave took a round to the forearm. Without even slowing down, he managed to get our guys back to the house using one arm to drive. After his arrival, Vega and I rushed him to the E R as he sat there, holding a jacket against the wound, trying to control his breaths. Within the next day, he made a full recovery.
Once Dave got back, everyone showered him with gratitude and praised his badassery. Vega approached him with a name tag in his hand and pinned it to Dave's shirt, signifying that he earned his right to be known as something more than a number: Sirius."
"  tragic incident: First grader threatened self-harm, classmates didn't intervene due to teacher's rule, he was taken away.","What's something horrible you've witnessed as a child but did not completely understand how horrible it really was?

When I was in the first grade there was this schoolmate named Mikey. He was a well mannered kid who was always dressed to the nines. One day he got in trouble for something small in class, maybe talking when he wasn't supposed to, being out of his seat when he wasn't supposed to or not following the typical rules. It was something he was bad to do but at the same time it wasn't something one would get into serious trouble for either. The teacher kindly reminded him of the rules, that he would go to recess 10 minutes late and that she would inform his parents.
Shit hit the fan.
He just completely broke down once he heard his parents would be told. He was crying profusely and screaming. He was uttering phrases like “Please don't tell them! I'll have to drink hot sauce, I'm gonna hurt so much!” and other phrases like those. The teacher tried and tried to calm him down to no avail when she finally called for assistance from the principal's office. Once the person arrived to our room, the teacher went into the hall to talk to them.
While she was out of the room, Mikey carried on with what us other first graders thought was a regular temper tantrum, I mean we all had those. About 20 seconds or so after the teacher went into the hall, he calmed down a bit. He was wearing a tie that day and then proceeded to take it off. He then wrapped it around his neck and started to end himself in front of all of us. He was doing a good job too as he was turning red and sweating pretty heavily too. As first graders, we all sat back and were like, “Wow, he's changing colors.” We were surprised but not shocked by the actions taking place in front of us.
We didn't go get the teacher from the hall because about a week earlier she was talking to somebody in the hall and we were bothering her with less important questions like “Can we sharpen our pencils?” or “Can we color?” She specifically told us not to interrupt her when she was talking to others because it was rude. So when this started happening we didn't but I remember one or two students saying we should but the majority reminding them of the ""No Interrupting"" rule.
Anyway, she runs into the room and is freaked out by what she sees. She yells at us and asks why nobody came to her and told her about this and we reminded her, in unison, that we were not supposed to interrupt when she was talking to others. We were 6 year olds and weren't aware of what was really happening with Mikey so we thought the rules applied, I mean he had just got in trouble for not obeying and this was happening and we didn't want to get in trouble. The teacher and the person that came to talk to her rushed him to the principal's office and we never heard from him again."

A month later, checked the phone bill to find that it never stopped. Confronted her again. Cue more begging and more denial on my part that she would let the life we had built go down in flames. This went on for a few months. So many promises. One night, I caught her on the phone when she thought I had left. Suddenly it's not just texts. Sometimes it was phone calls too. Just a friend she could talk to that she let things go too far with. Promised to break all contact. Swore it was never physical. Then I found emails. She detailed things that made me sick to read. But also included descriptions of his house. She broke finally, but swore it was all just in the line of duty. That's how she met, you see? Visiting nurse service, and this guy was a client. Promised she was done. Loved me, you see? No chance she was going to let 15 years go like that. I wasn't buying it anymore though. She announced she was going out one night with a work friend. Promised they were only going to the bar, then she'd be home. Maybe late, but not too late. She had taken over her own phone account by then, but wasn't bright enough to understand that Google Latitude was still showing me where she was, and I wasn't about to show my hand. She kissed me goodbye and bee-lined right for his house, and was there until the wee hours of the morning.

"  fired admin exposed manager's misconduct, leading to his termination and a public apology to his wife.","What is the best thing you saw someone do when they got fired from their job?

A manager for a company fired his long-time administrative assistant after fifteen years of service. The two knew each other longer than that and had a personal falling out in recent months. The manager lied and told her it was a result of re-budgeting, but handled it poorly as the admin knew more about the business than he did. She also knew a lot more about the manager’s personal and professional life than he realized. When the time came, it was an end-of-day dismissal. Usually, we grant two weeks and a severance package, especially after such long and distinguished service. But the manager was entering something of a mid-life crisis and was overheard telling a peer he wanted a newer, younger model. Yeah, straight out of Mad Men, I know. There was no party or even a cake. The admin walked into work Friday morning, did her job up until lunchtime and was pulled into the manager’s office. He let her go as of lunch, telling her it was a bonus to get a half-day paid to remove her things. He had not told anyone outside the exec team and HR. Security was waiting for the admin outside the manager’s office. Feeling understandably betrayed, the admin cleared out her desk and was perp-walked out by security. Meanwhile everyone gathered to find out what was happening. She was well-liked and everyone knew she worked hard and was loyal. No one understood why she was being fired in such a disrespectful way. The manager didn’t see it that way. In his mind, it was quick and quiet and dignified. She was already closed out of her computer and had her keycard taken, but she had to close out her Blackberry before handing it over to the guard. She sent her final emails and turned it over. Soon after, the Director of Human Resources received a large email and a link to a shared folder on the company network. It contained emails mocking and insulting the executive team, personal emails from the company accounts to two women the manager had been seeing outside his marriage, and inappropriate emails containing descriptions of female employees, photos, and jokes, including an exchange between the manager and someone in sales describing what they would do to a certain employee if she “fell into their clutches.” Oh, that was a very rough month and a large mess to clean up. Management argued that the admin should have blown a whistle and, therefore, should be denied severance. (You know “snitches get..” repeat a hundred times) But HR countered that the admin, who was unceremoniously terminated despite its recommendation to - y’know - NOT fire a good employee and maybe move her somewhere else, countered that any further aggression toward her might result in a costly, public lawsuit with a simple phrase - “He made me do it to keep my job.” Given that she was fired without cause within moments of sending the packet, it could be twisted that she was fired BECAUSE she exposed the manager. HR’s recommendation was to act on the evidence and shitcan the manager and tag the former salesman as a no-rehire. Management prevailed and the owner of the company severed the admin’s severance for failing to report actionable communications sooner. The following week, the owner reversed that decision after receiving a text message with the image of a manila envelope with the address of a local newspaper on the front. The admin also made a call of apology to the manager’s wife telling her she was fired after 15 years of keeping her husband’s secrets and begged forgiveness for betraying another woman in such a cruel way. I don’t know how that went after the manager was fired and had to deal with that at home in the same period of sunlight hours."

So everyone playing scattered, but I had a dick full of cayenne pepper and it was burning, like a lot. But it gets worse.
My friend that was over for the night decides to do it as well because I look like I'm ""being dramatic"". He didn't use as much as me, but we both were in so much pain and regretted everything. So we decided we were gonna go get cleaned up. Me first because I did it first. Except for one kinda big problem. My foster dad worked in construction, then go to my foster moms business and would help her until she closed. Then he would come home and shower immediately, then go to bed. He would get angry if you tried to shower after he had gone to bed, cause the bathroom was right next to his room, and the pipes were extremely loud. So by the time I got upstairs to get cleaned up, he was walking towards the only bathroom with a towel in hand. I had to tell my foster mom I was doing the ""pee pee dance"" cause I was moving around so much and looked so uncomfortable. I couldn't tell my foster parents the truth, cause that would involve them knowing that we were playing truth or dare and had a fit.
I went outside to ""pee"" but actually just left my wang hanging in the cool wind to help with the burning sensation that wouldn't go away. I also tried to scoop some of it off (yes I used that much, because I'm an idiot, that's why) but if I touched it too hard it was just burning more and felt even more uncomfortable. So I got the genius idea to grab two glasses of water, take them down for my friend and I, and we would get cleaned up downstairs in my room, then just dump the cayenne dick water out the window. Sounds great right?
I get the water downstairs, and my friend is already in my room, using one of my deodorant sticks on his junk to try and counter the burning. So he rubbed his sweaty cayenne pepper dick all over my deodorant I used for school after gym. By the look on his face, I could tell he could give less than a fuck about it. I couldn't really either cause I was focused on cleaning myself up. I hand my buddy his glass, and we clean ourselves up to the best of our abilities, dump out the cayenne dick water, and then go to bed.
The next morning, we go upstairs for breakfast and bring our glasses up. I went to put mine in the sink, and my foster dad said something like ""don't grab another glass we don't need any more dirty dishes then we already have"". And so I said ""oh no I'm just washing ours before dinner"". He says ""why? You just had water right? Its not even dirty"". And because I have social anxiety and didn't wanna talk about this any more than I already was, I just said ""yeah I guess your right"". We both filled our glasses with water, didn't touch them, then I got yelled at for wasting drinking water (we had to buy our water from in town cause our well water was salt water).
And yes, I forgot about the cayenne dick deodorant and put it on at school. It burned and chaffed my armpits during flag football. Worst fucking game of truth or dare I ever played."
  two-point rule in Barbados vs Grenada soccer match led to chaos as both teams scored own goals to manipulate results.,"What's a rule that was implemented somewhere, that massively backfired?

the infamous Barbados vs Grenada soccer match.
The organisers of the 1994 Caribbean tournament cup had a rather odd change to the rules for extra time. If a game was still drawn at full time, it would go to extra time but the first goal scored would win - this is perfectly normal (the ""golden goal"" rule). What was different is that they ruled that winning this way would count as having won by two goals for the purpose of tournament qualification, instead of just one.
Barbados went into a match against Grenada needing two goals to qualify for the main tournament. If they lost, or won by only one goal, Grenada would qualify instead. Under the regular rule, this would mean that if the match went to extra time, there would basically be no point Barbados playing because even if they scored, they would only win by one goal, and not qualify. But the two point rule would motivate them to play on. Sound good?
Well, you might be able to guess what happened.
The match looked like it was about to end with Barbados 2-1 Grenada - a win for Barbados, but not the two goals they needed. So Barbados deliberately scored an own goal in the last few minutes of the match, making the score 2-2, hoping to trigger extra time and a chance to score the magic 2-value goal.
The Grenada players quickly realized they could do the same - score an own goal to make the match 3-2 to Barbados, which would have Barbados winning by only one goal, so Grenada would qualify.
But the Barbados players realized that too.. and so they began to defend Grenada's goal.
So for the last 7 minutes of the match, Grenada were trying to score a goal in either net (since scoring a goal against Barbados would give them 3-2 and they would win the match, and scoring in their own goal would make it 3-2 to Barbados so they would lose the match but win the qualification), and Barbados were defending both.
Amazingly Barbados did actually manage to do so, successfully defending themselves while half of their team were defending Grenada's goal against Grenada, and then scored the golden goal in extra time and qualified!"
"  a person shares their struggles of feeling unattractive and overlooked by others, longing for acceptance and self-confidence.




","Tired of being the ""ugly"" friend.

Tired of being the ""ugly"" friend.
I’m so tired of being the unattractive or average looking friend. All my girl-friends are so pretty and attractive and I’m not exactly jealous in the way that I wish they weren’t- I just wish I was like them. When I was little, I was always the fat brown girl. Boys would pick on me, make fun of my big butt or legs, pretend to ask me out, the whole nine yards. I remember being beat up a few times for no reason. I remember the girls who would dramatically wipe their hands and laugh when they accidentally touched me. Looking back, it was mostly racism (I'm south asian) and just kids being idiots, but I've never forgotten how I felt. Even to this day, I feel disgusted. I don't let people hug me or touch me because I can still see the disgust on those girls' faces, like I was dirty or something. Even people looking at me makes me feel ashamed, like they don't deserve to see something as ugly as me. Even when I lost most of the weight in high school, I was never considered cute or pretty. No boys ever had a crush on me or even talked to me, really. I would avoid boys like a plague because I was scared that they'd think I like them even if I didn't. When I'd hang out with both girls and guys, I am treated so differently from them. The boys would carry things for my pretty friends, joke with them, flirt with them, help them with stuff, etc. And I would be utterly ignored. It's not even that I want their attention to be honest, it's just that I know I'm not being treated like a human being BECAUSE I'm unattractive. I can never relate to my girl friends when they talk about all the boys in their DM's or the men who ask them out when they're out at the grocery store or a party. I've never received any male attention. No, catcalling doesn't count, those creeps catcall anything that looks vaguely female. I always act like I don't want romance, I don't need a boyfriend, but really I feel like I don't deserve it. I feel like it's not for me. Whenever I have a crush on someone it's the worst experience. I fade out those feelings as soon as possible so I don't act a fool. Whenever I'm with friends, I love taking candid photos of them and seeing how happy they get when they see them. I never get the same. If I do, it's always unflattering so I just ask them to never take pics of me. They used to insist, but they stopped. I feel awful that I'm missing out on making nice memories just because I look ugly. I just want to enjoy life and enjoy spending time with my friends and family without feeling the overwhelming shame and disgust when it's time for photos. These experiences also make me feel less feminine. I constantly reject femininity because I don't get treated like the other girls. So how can I enjoy the pretty dresses or make up or bubbly personality?I've never told anyone about....any of this.I did a little bit to my therapist and she diagnosed me with Body Dysmorphic Disorder, but I'm pretty sure I'm just insecure and unattractive. I always put up a confident and careless front. I'm a great well rounded student and friend (I'm a senior in high school, graduating soon) so people don't know I'm so insecure. I never complain about how I'm treated and never make self-deprecating jokes to make people uncomfortable. I just pretend I'm normal and invisible. But it's starting to hurt. As graduation is coming up, there's so much pressure to look good and glow up to make the day memorable. I don't completely hate how I look now, but I suddenly feel like my 12 year old self again. I'm so tired."
"  a person recounts the unsettling experience of being stalked by someone they were once friends with, growing increasingly creepy.","The girl that rejected me is now stalking me - and it's getting creepier every day.

This all started about a month ago. There was this girl, let's call her Sarah, who had a huge crush on. We had some classes together in college and even studied together sometimes. One day, I mustered up the courage to ask her out on a date, but she turned me down - something about not wanting to ruin our friendship. I was a bit hurt, but respected her decision and tried to move on. Everything seemed normal for the first week or so after that. But then, I started noticing Sarah everywhere. At first, I thought it was just a coincidence - maybe we had more common interests than I initially thought, like what are the chances right? But as time went on, it became clear that this was more than just chance encounters. Sarah would be waiting outside my classes, claiming that she needed to talk to our mutual professor. A professor who is pretty close to me and I look up too. She would show up at my favorite coffee shop just minutes after I arrived. She even ""accidentally"" bumped into me at the grocery store multiple times. The creepiest part? Whenever we crossed paths, she would give me this intense stare that sent chills down my spine instead of talking to me about anything.I started getting paranoid and decided to confront her about it one day when she showed up at the library where I was studying alone. She acted surprised and denied everything, but there was something off about her reaction - like she was hiding something. Things got worse from there. One night, as I returned to my apartment after hanging out with friends, I noticed that my door was slightly ajar. My heart raced as I entered my home and discovered that someone had been inside. Nothing appeared to be stolen, but there were subtle signs of intrusion: some of my belongings had been moved around or misplaced. As if whoever broke in didn’t plan on stealing but rather trying to find something from me.Then came the messages. Random texts from unknown numbers containing vague threats and warnings: ""You should have given her a chance,"" ""She's not the one you should have rejected,"" ""She's watching you.""These messages don’t even make sense because if it’s the person I’m thinking then I wasn’t the one rejected her? Anyways I tried blocking the numbers, but that was pointless as new ones would always appear. So I change my numbers and I even went to the police, but without any solid evidence or proof, they couldn't do much to help me as they suggested “if the text is only evidence then just change your phone number as someone can just be pranking you” however I haven’t told anyone about anything as I didn’t wanna look dumb because they will just say it’s chances.Now, every day is a constant state of unease and fear. I've tried changing my routine and avoiding places where I might run into her, but she still finds me. I can't shake the feeling that she's always watching me, lurking in the shadows as cringey as that sounds.I'm not sure what she wants or why she's doing this as I try talking about this with her already. All I know is that it's getting creepier by the day, and I'm not sure how much more I can take. Has anyone else experienced something like this? Any advice on how to deal with a stalker who used to be a friend?"
  the implementation of a rule to prevent employees from leaving early led to decreased productivity and longer working hours for everyone.,"What rule Implemented at your work Massively backfired?

Worked for a warehouse four days a week. 11am-9:30pm Monday to Thursday. They reiterated many times during the interview process that overtime was optional. My first day my supervisor told me that overtime is indeed optional, but if you don't stay for overtime then everybody else has to stay even later. ""So if you do leave on time, don't come back.""
Eh whatever. I didn't mind the extra hours too much (although a 10.5 hour shift is already long) but the bonus was that we could go early if all the orders were done. As you can imagine, the good workers busted their ass from start to finish cutting as many corners (good and bad ones) as they could in order to get out early. Normally this ended up with us being able to leave around 15 mins early or on a really good day where the stars aligned (re:everybody showed up), we could leave as early as 7:30 or 8. However.. leaving that early only happened once or twice a year at most.
Overtime was every week. Every single Monday we would work until 2am. 11am-2am isn't ideal when you have no idea when you're off. At around 7pm we'd start to get an idea if we're in for another hour or another 6. One of the genius new hires mentioned to the boss in the office how he was hoping to get out by 6. Oh good. Apparently the boss was thinking us leaving early was a common occurance now and decided that nobody was going to be leaving early any more. Sweep or dust or whatever, but nobody leaves until 9:30.
All of a sudden we were late every single day without fail. Why? We were working our asses off to get out early but failing every day and ending up on time (or still late). By taking away our ability to leave early, everybody gave up working hard. ""Slow down! We've got another hour left anyways. I'm not sweeping."". Went from about 45 hours a week to 55. 13 hours every day. Nobody ever left early anymore... but nobody left on time either. Losses for everybody involved because the boss didn't realize that us leaving early for 2 days out of a year actually gave us the daily motivation to work our asses off the other 360"
"  future mother-in-law attempts to squeeze into bride's wedding dress, damaging it, and refuses to apologize or cover repair costs.","I caught my future mother in law trying to squeeze into my wedding dress. It didn't go well.

I've been engaged to my fiance for a year. We're planning to be married in December in Colombia and of course, I'm beyond pumped. It's going to be a destination wedding for us, and I was very happy that I was able to talk him into having one. My soon to be Mother in law is extremely upset about this. I always knew that she wasn't really my biggest fan. She's polite and very ""fake"" friendly but she'll do things like sit on my fiance's lap, or tuck his hair behind his ear, and cut his food for him. On occasion I actually saw her actually feed him in public. However, to my fiance's credit, once I told him that I thought that was beyond weird, it never happened again. Future Mother in law is very upset about our destination wedding. She thinks we'll all be killed, whines constantly about the cost of her airfare, the size of the wedding, the guests that won't be able to come, the thought of my fiancee getting malaria, the fact that she hates no one in Colombia speaks English, you get the picture. I try to limit her exposure to my wedding planning, though when I do this, she complains to my fiance behind my back on how she's being excluded. She came over yesterday, theoretically to see our new house, but instead offered the following criticisms: She hates my engagement ring.  Our house is an extravagant display of wealth and just ""isn't us"". It's a townhouse that we got a steal on. I’m getting fat. Need to watch the calories so I can ""fit into my dress"". Future, meanwhile, is bragging about her diet and how chic and slenderizing her mother of the bride dress is. This delightful conversation was interrupted by my fiance asking me to help him put a bed in the spare guest room together, so I left her to her own devices and Netflix while I helped. About 40 minutes into assembly, I went to take a bathroom break and headed into the master bedroom, and what do I find but Future MIL struggling to yank my dress over her head but was stuck. I blurted out ''what the hell?!"" and she immediately started stammering ""Oh my God!"" At that point my number one concern was her tearing the sheer backing of my dress so I rushed over to help her. It was all for not as she managed to scratch her way through the back of the dress and completely destroy the sheer material. She burst the side zipper of the dress and got a dirty footprint on the train. I asked her, as soon as I got her out of the dress, what the hell she was thinking. She responded that she was just trying to make sure the dress would fit me; because if the dress fit her, then it absolutely fit me too. If it didn't fit her, then I obviously had some work to do. Nevermind that I just had my final fitting and it had fit like a glove. My future fiance is very disturbed by what happened. I'm also disturbed, mostly because I doubt she was trying to just try on the dress for funsies; there was also a bouquet of dried flowers on the bed that wasn't there before. I think she was actually trying to pretend she was the bride, which for so many reasons, is so wrong. She hasn't offered to pay for any of the repairs to the dress. A section of the train is ripped. I have no idea how much it's going to cost until I can get to the seamstress tomorrow. In the meantime, in lieu of an apology, she's lecturing me on spending so much money on a wedding dress and clearly the trouble she had getting into the dress was a sign to get something less dramatic and ostentatious."
"  person confronts parents about their divorce, demands truth about the reason. Threatens to assume worst if they won't disclose. AITA?","AITA for telling my parents that if they won’t tell me the truth, I’ll assume the worst of them

So my family totally exploded while I was on spring break two weeks ago. I went on a trip with my grandparents and came back to my mom moved out and a serious sit down talk about them divorcing. It’s not exactly a surprise because they’ve both been acting weird and shady for awhile but like that’s not what I was expecting to come back to and they could have let me unpack first at least. They asked me if I had any questions and I asked them which one cheated because that was my first thought. They got super uncomfortable and said that the reasons between them were private. I said not when it means I suddenly lost my family over it and they owe me at least some reason that this is happening and “we don’t love each other anymore” doesn’t cut it. You don’t just stop loving someone for no reason that’s dumb, so what? They said that was all I needed to know and we need to talk about how the living situation was going to work and everything. I told them that I don’t want to live with either of them if they’re going to be like that. Everyone has been mad since then and my mom came over to talk it out last night. They still don’t want to tell me why. I told them both that if they were going to hide stuff, I’ll just make up my own worst case and go with that. Since mom left, it can all be her fault. Since it’s her fault, I won’t live with her or go see her. She got upset and said that was unfair and it wasn’t her fault. I told her to give me the real reason then or just deal with it. My dad said I was out of line and I said that it can all be his fault then and same deal. That started an argument between the two of them, but I’m holding my own. Pretty sure at least one of them will crack and tell me what happened soon so I can decide how I feel about it. I don’t need graphic details but a simple “someone cheated” or “mom switched teams, don’t tell anyone” or “we’ve both really changed a lot and don’t want the same things” would help. If one of them did something bad I want to know. If they won’t own up or explain why there are no bad guys, they can both be the bad guy."

","My girlfriend went on an anti Semitic rant to me. She doesn’t know I’m Jewish…

We’ve been together for 3 months and I had no idea that she held those beliefs. She’s always been a calm, “make love not war” kinda person and very kind to everyone. This is completely out of character and I’m still not sure if she was trolling or not. Yesterday evening we were sitting in the car and she was talking to some guy from her internship. She sounded heated and they were clearly arguing over something. When she hung up she said that he was an asshole, a douchebag, then she started calling him a “dirty Jew”. I was shocked to say the least and didn’t even know what to say, it came out of nowhere. She said that all Jews are “extremely arrogant” and that they disgust her. for the record, we never discussed our religious backgrounds. Neither of us are religious (she’s Middle Eastern) so that’s just not something we ever brought up. She continued saying that you can’t trust Jews, that they’re all “rats” and that she’d rather die than associate with someone “so corrupt”. I asked her if that’s how she really feels and she said “yes of course, every single one of them little penny pinchers deserve nothing but eternal sadness as only a fraction of a percent of their karma for the suffering they have caused”. I still haven’t told her that I’m Jewish, I’m not even sure how she will react when I do tell her. Should I even bother? It sucks because she’s an amazing girl and I’m ridiculously attracted to her but had no clue she was like this. I’m shaking.

"  husband's ex-girlfriend wore the wedding dress she was supposed to wear to their wedding, leaving his new wife upset.




","My husband's ex girlfriend outshined me on our wedding day

Last weekend, my husband and I got married. It was a great wedding, and I had a great time leading up to it. There's been only one thing that's left a sour taste in my mouth. Growing up, I always wanted a big princess wedding. I know some people see those as tacky and immature, but it was always my dream. As part of this, the theme for our wedding was ""ballroom,"" and I told everyone to wear the nicest things they owned and told the women in particular to try to ""outshine"" me. I even went as far as telling the married women to wear their wedding dresses. I didn't care about being outdressed. Instead, all I wanted was to fulfill the aesthetic in my head that I had for the wedding, which included everyone else looking nothing less than extravagant. Now on to my husband's friend. My husband has this friend I'll call ""Kate"". Kate is my husband's childhood friend and first love. My husband comes from a small town, and the majority of his friends he's known since adolescence. In their senior year of high school, Kate and my husband got engaged (which is kinda normal where they're from) but called off the wedding and never went through with it. It was mutual. They felt they were growing up too fast and wanted to slow down. The calling off the wedding was the end of the relationship, but they stayed friends. I knew this information prior to getting with my husband and never had a problem or felt jealous because I'm friends with a few exes myself. In fact, two of them were invited to our wedding. One was my bridesmaid (I'm bisexual) and the other was invited as a guest along with his current girlfriend. I've never had a problem with Kate being my husband's ex but I have had a problem with Kate as a person as she's kind of bitchy and gossips like she's still in highschool. A few examples of this are just a month into our relationship she confessed to my husband she still had some lingering feelings to which he responded they had already tried that and it didn't work, if she brought it up again he would to cut her off out of respect for me. I wasn't that mad at the time, because I understood they had a long history and my relationship with him was just starting out, and she owed it to herself to see if there was anything still there before it was too late. However after she was turned down her attitude towards me changed to fake nice and started calling me things like cougar, or asking me how I expected to make a relationship work as I want to be an anesthesiologist which would require long hours, or telling my husband's whole friend group how she doesn't like my ""loud"" personality, and when I confronted her about all of those things she would say ""oh it was just a joke"" or ""you're so loud I felt like you would just go off"". There's more shit but if I typed it all, I would never get to the point. Kate has her own husband I'll call Jarold. Kate and Jarold both make average in terms of finances as they are both teachers. Kate kindergarten and Jarold seniors. They got married last year. On a teachers salary Kate wasn't able to afford the most luxurious wedding dress out there, but I always had the impression she was happy with it. Kate does have another wedding dress from when she was going to marry my husband that her dad payed for (who has unfortunately passed now) which in terms of fanciness is a bit nicer, but obviously she didn't wear that dress to her own wedding. I was expecting Kate to wear the wedding dress she wore to her own wedding to our wedding. But when I looked and saw her she had the wedding dress she was supposed to wear when she was getting married to my husband. When I saw her I immediately went ""what the f"" but decided to just drop it because I didn't want a conflict on our wedding day. My husband, however, was also confused on why she wore that one and asked her about it without me even having to tell him I was uncomfortable. She responded ""well your wife wanted such a big princess wedding I thought I'd wear this one because it follows the theme more, don't tell me she's upset about it, she's the one who said come in you're nicest clothes and this is my nicest dress"". I feel like I'm not allowed to be upset even though I am, and I know this is my fault, but the whole thing has really left a bad taste in my mouth. I would've never been okay with her wearing that one if I'd known she was going to, and I feel like she should've asked. I keep telling myself it's not that big of a deal, and during the daytime, when I'm distracted, I don't even think about it. But I've always been a night owl, and it makes me shitty every time I think about it before I fall asleep. So now I'm here complaining on reddit like a loser. I feel pathetic.

","My husband got a paternity test on our daughter and it came back negative, but I never cheated

I don't know how it happened and I haven't been able to stop crying all day. I never cheated. I love my husband, we've been together since college and he's the love of my life, he's handsome and kind and while I've slept with two other people, both were before we got together. There is no other potential father for our daughter. We were married already and actively trying for a baby. I never cheated, I never would cheat, and I don't know why he took that stupid test because I would never, ever cheat, but it came back negative and now he thinks he's not her dad. I don't know how to convince him it was a faulty test and I'm so scared. These past few months it's like he's become someone completely different from the man I married. He's cold, and suspicious. He kept demanding to see my phone, and wouldn't tell me why, and I showed him at first but eventually told him I wouldn't anymore unless he explained why. He's been distant with our daughter too. He stays in his office for hours on end, and I don't know what he's doing. I did not cheat. He accused me this morning, saying he'd done the test after realizing that our daughter's eyes wouldn't naturally come from ours and that he wanted me to get out of the house. I didn't leave and he locked me out of our bedroom and now I'm in my daughter's room. Edit: Also, I just had a conversation with my husband. He's out of his room now, and we discussed some things. I told him again that I would never cheat and started talking about a list I made of tests I want done, but he told me that he didn't want to hear it right now. We're going to have a longer conversation tomorrow and he said that he still loves our daughter, and he won't try to keep me out of the house or our room for now. I asked him to hug me and he did.

"  middle-class American life: College pressure, debt, unfulfilling career, mortgage, financial strain, repetitive cycle, unmet dreams, and generational struggles.




","What gets more messed up the longer you think about it?

The whole idea of what life should be like, at least in middle class America. As a young person, you pretty much have to go to college after high school if you want a decent paying, secure job (Of course if you go into a trade it's a different story but stay with me here). So you have to go to college if you want a good job. But, oh shit, you weren't a stellar student in high school, so no scholarship for you. Your parents are good, hard working people and they make just the right amount so that you don't get much in the way of help from them, but you also can't qualify for grants or hardship scholarships. So, you are forced to take out tens of thousands of dollars in loans to pay for the school that you have to attend. You graduated, hooray! You're not exactly happy with the career you'll have to enter, but hey, you'll make good money and have job security. And congrats, you married the girlfriend you met in college. Now it's time to buy a house. The market in your area isn't great, but you find a pretty nice house that you can afford on a thirty year mortgage. Between the house and the new cars you bought to reliably get you and the wife to work, there isn't much cash left over to go on vacation. Oh well. Priorities, right? Things are good for a few years and you finally have a little security in the bank. But now it's time for kids. You have two, because you only want to replace your wife and yourself - you're responsible people. Only now there are two tiny people that are reliant on you for literally everything. But that's okay, you'll take the financial strain and the stress because you love them. Fast forward a few years. Your life has become a cycle. You go to the job that you now resent, so you can pay off the loans that you had to take out for college. Your income also goes to paying for the house that's now just a little too small. Your car payments are still coming because you have to upgrade for the kids' safety. Every hour at work is spent in an effort to pay bills that keep you firmly rooted in the decisions you made ten years ago. Oh sure, you go on vacation. To Disney World, or to visit grandma halfway across the country. You'll definitely go to Europe when the kids are out of the house. You've only had sex once in three years, but you're living the ""American Dream"". Rinse and repeat. Go to work, pay your bills, and support your family. Keep telling yourself it'll get better. Eventually you learn to just appreciate the little things because life isn't nearly as exciting as you'd once hoped. But you keep doing what you're ""supposed to do"" until you're old enough to go to a nursing home. Your kids visit every once in a while, but they're very busy digging themselves out of the same ever deepening hole that you have been in since you were 18. Eventually, death becomes your only relief, and you welcome it. F. That.
"
  an amusing tactic to annoy telemarketers: Pretend to have a difficult-to-pronounce name and engage in comedic improvisation during calls.,"What's the best way to annoy a scammer by phone?

This is more to do with telemarketers, but it's the same general idea.
My family had a bit of an amusing litmus test for ferreting out unwanted callers before they could run through their spiel. Our last name – while easy enough to pronounce – looks like it requires one to imitate the sound of an engine block exploding... and that's just the first syllable. As a result, folks who don't personally know us often have trouble getting it right on the first try, and this led to our household rule:
If someone on the telephone mispronounces our last name, then they're fair game.
Now, granted, this occasionally resulted in some hilarious misunderstandings, but it was an effective enough tactic for the most part. My parents were absolutely fine with letting me answer calls from ""Unknown Number,"" too, which gave me ample opportunity to improvise counterattacks. Perhaps my best attempt came one evening when I was thirteen years old, as I ran through the following exchange:
""Good evening, Mister... Mister..."" the man on the phone began.
""Oh!"" I interrupted, feigning a ridiculous accent that was somewhere between Indian and Swedish. ""Yes, yes! You are knowing that I have just purchased this phone number!""
""This isn't Mister, uh...""
""No! No, no, no, no, no!"" I hurriedly interrupted again. ""No, the name you are having is being incorrect! I am Mister Yuran Eedwah!""

""Yes!"" I gushed. ""Yes, yes, oh, yes! It is so nice to be calling all of my friends and family, because they are living still in Jeirheinia now!"" (Don't bother looking for ""Jeirheinia"" on a map. You won't find it.)
""Ah, I see!"" replied the telemarketer. ""And are you happy with your long-distance provider?""
In response, I offered only a sputtering cough and gibberish.
""And what if I told you,"" the telemarketer continued, ""that you could pay up to 50% less than you are now for your long-distance phone service?""
""Yes!"" The shriek even hurt my ears, and I was the one who'd offered it. ""Yes, yes, yes! Tell me! Tell me, please! How can I be having this low price?!""
""Hah, well,"" answered the telemarketer, ""let me take down some information, and we'll get you started! What did you say your name was, again?""
""Yuran Eedwah.""
""Great. How do you spell that?""
I'm sure the smirk on my face was audible through the phone. ""U-R-A-N,"" I said, ""I-D-I-O-T.""
""Got it. Now, then, Mister Eedwah, do you have a...""
""I am sorry!"" I interrupted (yet again). ""Can you please to be reading back how you spelled my name? I am not hoping for mistakes!""

"  a shocking high school reunion transformation: Once popular student became an overweight, socially awkward ""proud incel,"" causing discomfort among attendees.


","Teachers who get invited to high school reunions, what is the most shocking transformation you’ve seen? 

One kid grew up to be ""that"" guy, treading the line between jolly neckbeard and somewhat scary incel. I saw him after a full 12 years had passed.
The worst part is, he was one of the most popular and socially adjusted kids in school. Always invited to parties, girls always trying to spend time with him, he'd always get away with absurd things in school because even the teachers liked him. He was just really funny and naturally charismatic. Not to mention fit and handsome.
However, he was strictly religious so he never had s x with any girls. A few years after graduation, he became an atheist (or just agnostic?), but by this time he had a dead-end job at a supermarket, had gained weight and was obsessed with Dragon Ball Z because he related to ""unleashing his true power"".
So he spent like 5 years desperately messaging girls from HS, trying to say ""hey I can have s x now"", but he was just not that attractive anymore and his social skills had deteriorated tremendously. He was rejected by every single girl that was pining over him just a few years ago, in high school.
He ended up publicly coming out as a ""proud incel"" 2 years before the reunion, in a post where he ""declared war"" on women and socially adjusted men. He often posted about being a virgin and how Christianity basically made him an incel because he missed out every chance for s x he ever had.
So at the reunion, he came wearing a white t-shirt with the words ""F you"". He'd walk up to now-married women that he had previously solicited and just smirked silently, waiting for them to read the shirt. He was thrown out of the venue after about 40 minutes since so many people complained of his creepy behavior.

","What are the benefits of being unnatractive?

A little late but there is a girl at my college known for sleeping around a lot. There are a bunch of rumors surrounding her but I know for a fact that she has taken two random guys up to her room on the same night (I worked as a doorman at the time). She wasn't the best student by any means choosing to party over studying or anything like that. About a year ago, I was drunk at a bar and saw her there. She saw me and we talked for a bit and she asked to dance. I'm not the most attractive person by any means, so this had never happened to me. I took her offer, why not, could be fun. After about 4 songs worth of grinding or so, she turns around and gives me this wide eyed look. She quickly says ""I have to go"" and rushes out the door as quick as she could. I assumed she had a moment of clarity and left. I met back up with friends, told them what happened, and we all left a bit later. The next day there is a huge party and apparently she didn't go, people were saying she wanted to study instead. In fact, she didn't go to the bar or any party for the rest of the semester. She made dean's list that semester and is on track to make dean's list this semester too. When I talk about it to my friends, they say she probably hooked up with someone else that night or she went out a different night but I saw her look of shock. I saw her directly leave the bar. I know she didn't go to that party that she would normally go to the very next night. She hit rock bottom by simply dancing with me and it was enough to truly change her life.

"  awkward Tinder date turns bizarre as she asks if he plans to kill her, spills wine, and makes strange advances.
","What was your most awkward sexual experience?

My first, and last, Tinder date, circa 2014.  Met her at a bar, she’s cute and kind of awkward and dorky, which I like. We have nice but very light conversation. Nothing went very deep before the subject was changed. I see it’s not really going anywhere and we don’t have much chemistry. After an hour or so I pay for drinks and go to say goodnight, and she asks me back to her place. Sure, I guess. Then she asks me, in all seriousness, if I’m planning on killing her. Uhh... Huh. I explain to her that I am not. Although that was weird, I still follow her back to her house. We sit in her living room drinking red wine and listening to indie music. It’s kind of nice, and we get cuddly. She then mentions she has a flight early in the morning for a family vacation with her parents and siblings, which I take as a hint. She then spills a huge glass of red wine on her white carpet and spends the next 20 minutes frantically trying to clean it up. It leaves a decent stain. I’m ready to leave at this point but she apologizes and asks me to stay the night. My instincts were screaming no but my curiosity said we gotta see where this goes. We go up to her room and get in her bed. Clothed. She says “ok good night” and turns off the light. I’m so confused at this point I just lay there in the dark like wtf even is this? She then says “I’m sorry we’re not having s x. I feel like I’m leading you on. I’d give you a blow job but I don’t want to be sick for my trip.” (What does that even mean??) I go yeah it’s ok and now start planning my escape. As I lay there in silence she starts running her fingers through my hair. Hmm ok. She keeps doing it but now starts whispering “baaaaby. baaaaby.” Over and over as she does it. I finally nope the f out and say the wine made me feel bad and I had to leave. It took me a good week to feel normal again after that. It was like some American Horror Story shit.

"  a motorcyclist's Sena device helped him silently call 911 during a home invasion, leading to his rescue and the intruder's capture.




","Redditors who have nearly been murdered but talked your way out of it, what did you say to your would-be killer that saved your life?

I am a motorcycle rider. Just over a year ago I purchased my Sena 20S and at the time, it met all my expectations.  Great sound quality for music, clear calls, and contact with my fellow riders. Little did I know that one day it would save my life.
On Feburary 28th, 2016 around 9:30pm I came home from a ride.  I got off my bike in the driveway where I was met by a man with a gun who had broken into my home. He demanded I enter the house and as I approached the door, threw my cell phone onto the ground. As I crossed the threshold I was forced to the ground and my hands and feet were bound with phone cord.
The intruder resumed his vicious ransacking of my house while I lay there in my helmet wondering what was going to happen to me when he was done. Sometime later my roommate pulled up and parked his car in the garage.  The intruder ran out the front door to confront him, I heard a scuffle outside for a few minutes after which my roommate was forced into the house, bloodied, beaten and then bound in a separate room from myself. The destruction of the house continued once again. He discovered the safe, pistol, and rifle cases; violently demanding the keys and combinations while kicking my roommate. He began speaking irrationally about how he was looking for child corn and assault rifles, how someone sent him to our house months earlier and he had been watching the house for a couple day. He was going to hold us for about 2 days while he cleaned up his fingerprints and burned parts of the house to get rid of any DNA. He would then drive us to the middle of nowhere and leave us for dead. While he was spending time in the the back room attempting the break into the safe, I was able to break one of my hands free and turn my Sena on. The moment the Sena said “phone connected” I had a small glimmer of hope. The noise of the intruder breaking into the safe granted me an opportunity to access the voice command “speed dial” system on the Sena. Whispering quietly, I didn’t necessarily care who it ended up calling, I just prayed for anyone to answer. My father who is 3 hours ahead on the eastern time zone answered and I repeatedly whispered “ 9-1-1, 9-1-1, 9-1-1” he eventually replied back to me “9-1-1?” confirming he knew there was a problem.  I then started repeatedly whispering my address, at which point the intruder came around the corner and yelled at me “what’s that noise!?”. I told him “it’s just the radio playing in the helmet and I can’t turn it off.” He proceeded to take a hammer to the side of my helmet while it was still on my head, destroying the Sena. He grabbed the remains and threw them in the toilet.  He then started a fire in the fireplace to burn random items from around the house including his own shoes, which he replaced with the shoes directly off my feet.  My father eventually tried calling back, but when my cell phone rang, the intruder smashed it with the hammer and threw it in the fire as well. The police finally arrived and noticed the blood on ground from the scuffle and called for backup. The intruder became nervous, he unbound me and instructed me to answer the door and send the cops away. I agreed, stood up and approached the front door. The police were shouting “Local Police Dept, Open the door!” over and over again, and my roommate shouted back from the other room “We are in here” repeatedly. The intruder ran to the other room to silence my roommate. I reached out and opened the door to five or six officers with weapons drawn. I ran out into the front yard yelling “hostage” with my hands up, hoping no one would shoot. As I was about to be restrained, behind me the intruder slammed the door. The police quickly withdrew back to the street. I was escorted by an officer as fast as possible to the street barely able to keep my footing as we moved. dragged through the front lawn and placed in the back of the squad car. I updated them on the situation inside the house and how to distinguish between my roommate and the intruder. The local SWAT team was called in to secure the house.  After another two hours or so, my roommate was finally able to escape his bindings and make his way out of the house, beat up but safe. The intruder ended up escaping out the back door of the house somewhere in that two hour window of time. The entire ordeal lasted around six hours, the suspect has been found in jail from unrelated charges and was linked to the case with evidence found at my house.

","What’s a non-obvious sign that someone is poor? 

Hygiene. The school I work at just turned one of the coaches locker rooms into a room for kids to take showers in.
They come to school, one of us steals them for first period, they take a shower and are given some comfy clothes to hang out in while we wash and dry what they came to school in, they don’t want to wear a new outfit because other kids will know they changed. We pretend we’re taking them for speech therapy or something.
One girl wears her dads old T-shirt’s that smell like men’s body odor really badly. One student said that his parents let all their friends live with them so he doesn’t get to take a shower anymore because they all share the one bathroom.

"  Vietnam War veteran's will promised a valuable vintage car collection in Michigan, but it turned out to be nonexistent.




","Lawyers who read wills to families, what is the most bizarre thing you have read? 

My grandfather, a Vietnam War veteran, suffered from PTSD. It got worse in his later years and he would often isolate himself from the rest of the family, often hiding out in his bedroom when visitors were over.
My grandmother would often tell us stories about how he had inherited a significant amount of money from his father way back when. She said that in their younger years he often spent his inheritance on luxurious dates and trips. After returning from war, he spent the remaining money on a house in which he and my grandmother settled and raised their children.
Fast forward to his death, just a couple months back and we found out he had written a will. Even my grandmother didn't know about it.
We all had assumed he wouldn't have much to leave since most of the money he had saved from his time in the military was going towards taking care of him as he was placed in a care facility as his PTSD worsened.
His will told of a warehouse in Township, Michigan that held a large collection of vintage cars. He said that the warehouse was passed down from his father, and he had all the documents to prove that he was the owner of some type of warehouse. His will estimated that the cars would be worth an excess of two million dollars total. The money from his collection would be split between his four children.
We had no idea this collection ever existed. My father and his three brothers had all grown up in Plano, Texas. None of us had ever been to Michigan before. Even our mother couldn't recall a time of our father ever having even gone to visit Michigan.
After a long debate, my father and I, the only ones who could manage to find some time off from work, agreed to fly out to Michigan to see this collection first hand.
After a few thousand dollars spent on plane tickets, hotels, ect. We finally arrived at the warehouse my grandfather owned. It was a run down warehouse, but it was tucked away within a compound of other warehouses that seemed to be otherwise well taken care of.
Finally code in hand, my father punched the numbers into the keypad and the giant door began to rise. What was inside was beyond words.
There was absolutely nothing. Besides a few homeless people that managed to sneak in through a hole under a fence, we assumed he made the whole thing up in his mind.

"  how in poverty, expensive yet meaningful possessions for young parents are their children, providing a sense of purpose and identity.




","What is something expensive, but only owned by poor people?

Kids, poor people tend to be very fruitful.
They also tend to have them much younger than their wealthier counterparts. A lot of people like to assume it's because poor people are too dumb to understand birth control, so I'd like to offer a hypothetical perspective on this.
Imagine you're a 17 year old girl, growing up in poverty. You're not the best student, so even if you could get financial aid for college, you're afraid you wouldn't do very well anyway... plus, you need that time to work and make money, and school so far has only gotten in the way of that. After (if) you graduate high school, you'll probably work the same minimum wage job you've been working, only now you'll get more hours. What do you have to look forward to? What's within your grasp that would make you something meaningful?
Well, being a mom is pretty important and special. Everyone celebrates a new baby. Plus, like any 17 year old, you're eager to show you're an adult now, and what could be more adult than being a parent?
So yeah, you know about rubbers. You and your boyfriend use them sometimes, but not always. You know that the clinic will give you birth control, but you gained weight and felt sick when you tried it, so you don't bother with it again (plus it's a whole bus trip and a bunch of waiting, and you have better things to do). You're not planning to get pregnant, but when you end up that way, it's not some sort of death sentence. Abortion is expensive and scary (to say nothing of whether it's even accessible to you, or whether you or your family has a moral objection to it), so that's not really an option. And after the first couple weeks of anxiety, you start to get excited about how this could be a good thing. People are nicer to you than they've been in years - checking up on you, asking about the pregnancy and the baby. You're something now: you're a mom."
"  teacher's ""jar of punishments"" involved student-created rules and humiliating punishments, leading to complaints and eventual removal of the practice.




","What did your teacher do that you didn’t realize until you were older was fucked up?

He had a ""jar of punishments"" for whenever you broke one of the ""rules."" Both the punishments and the rules could be created by the students, and if you broke the rules you had to draw a punishment. Rules included everything from insulting another student, to speaking out of turn, to forgetting a pencil. The punishments all centered on public humiliation. And because it was a class of high schoolers given almost full reign every class devolved into nothing but trying to bait other students into being punished or convincing the teacher they needed to be.
Punishments included forcing students to get on hands and knees while pushing a penny across the room with their nose and saying ""beep beep I'm a jeep,"" performing the highly sexual ""call on me dance,"" requiring students to scoot up and down every aisle of desks on their butt like a dog while barking the whole time, or making one kid spend an entire class at the front of the room, facing the wall, wearing a literal dunce cap. I forgot a pencil one day and had to stand at the front of the room while every student in the class balled up a piece of paper and threw it at me. One kid threw an entire notebook. I then had to crawl around on the floor and clean up all the trash .
The teacher ended up getting reported at the end of the year after I and several other students complained about it unofficially to a different teacher, and while he wasn't fired the jar of punishments was gone the next year"
"  student's ""Get to know me"" paper consisted entirely of ""I hate all of you,"" expressing emotional turmoil and seeking attention.




","Teachers, what’s the weirdest thing a student has put on their “Get to know me” paper from the beginning of the school year?

I had a student last year write ""I hate all of you"" for every single question. (This was 6th grade English) Age: ""I hate all of you"", Grade: ""I hate all of you', Favorite Animal: ""I hate all of you"", Favorite Book: ""I hate all of you"", and so on and so forth. This was a cry for attention from this kid to both Mom and Dad after said student found out his parents were divorcing the day after he and mom moved to the states. Kid was a military kid and had never been to the states. In his mind, any cry for attention would make mom and dad talk, thus would make them get back together.
He progressively got worse through the year and by Halloween Mom had withdrawn him after he ran away from school and sat in the middle of the street in front of it (he hid in the bathroom during homeroom, waited for the hallways to clear, then ran out of the school like a bat out of hell.
We only know this because one of the guidance counselors saw him and his homeroom teacher reported him missing.) Since he was being homeschooled, school still had to keep tabs on him to ensure he was progressing along with his peers. School finds out he's not due to still trying to carry out his plan of getting his parents back together. Dad then began threatening mom for full custody when he came state-side due to her ""not being able to get to school."" (To be fair, the kid played mom like a fiddle and ran the household like a tyrannical preteen king). Last we heard, he had run away from home in an effort for Mom and Dad to get back together, cops found him a few hours later on a playground, and Dad sent him away to military school across the country.

"  a doctor's heart-wrenching diagnosis: a young woman's hidden brain cancer led to her sudden demise, leaving her family devastated.","Doctors of Reddit, what is the most heart wrenching diagnosis you've ever had to give?

Doctors of Reddit, what is the most heart wrenching diagnosis you've ever had to give? While I was on neuro consults, a 23 year old girl came in complaining of a headache for 6 months. At first I thought she was exaggerating, possibly looking for painkillers. Then I saw she'd actually been to an outpatient neurologist, who tried every med under the sun for presumed migraines, and had gotten a CT scan and MRI without contrast (both unrevealing). The pain became unbearable so the girl came to the hospital and was admitted for further workup. Right after she is admitted, per our recommendation, she gets an MRI with contrast - which shows leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (cancer metastases all over the matter covering her brain). I had gone home for the day by the time the result was read (I was just on consult service), but the attending from the primary medical team sat down with the girl around 7pm that night and explained she had cancer, and they didn't know where it was coming from yet. He explained the most likely places were either her stomach or her uterus. He asked if she wanted help in telling her family (who had also gone home to rest for the evening after being at bedside all day), but the patient decided to have tests done to find where the primary cancer was first so she would have a better idea of what the plan was moving forward when she told her family. The next day, I get to the hospital around 9am (consult service hours are nice). I pull up my patient list, and she's listed as not being in the hospital anymore. I thought maybe she signed out against medical advice. I open her chart to find out that around 6:30 that morning, the patient became altered and then quickly unresponsive. Code was called, CPR started, the whole works. Her family shows up at around 7:15AM to see a team of doctors doing chest compressions - the team hadn't even had time to inform them of the code yet, because it all happened so fast. Remember, these people had no idea the girl had cancer or even anything seriously wrong with her (other than her headache). They were devastated and initially insisted that everything be done to keep her alive. But after witnessing a few rounds of CPR, they asked for the priest to come and give her her last rites, and she passed away. I cried so hard I couldn't see patients for most of the day. This poor young girl, all of a sudden just gone, and her poor family who had no idea it was coming. She was trying to protect them and give them hope - such a mature decision for someone her age - but they ended up in pain anyway. So tragic.

Got her in the car, got to the hospital, and they moved her into ED pretty damn quick as she was screaming in pain. My champion of a sister managed to answer their questions whilst dealing with the worst pain of her life. She did her best to comply with their exams etc. Eventually, a doctor comes in, and says they suspect she has an STD that is causing the pain. Except no STDs are showing up on their panels. He tells us it's his 'best guess', tells us we can be on our way, and leaves the room. Cue my sister vomiting in excruciating pain every time she moved - we pressed the call bell and they asked what was up. I said there is absolutely no way we could leave the hospital with her in this condition. The nurse just scoffed at us, then left. We were left in ED with my sister vomiting in pain, telling me she was going to die - every call button press resulted in literally no one coming to see us. Of if they did, we got told 'There are bigger emergencies than you right now'. She had at least 7 buckets of sick sitting on the shelf from how much pain she was in, and no one saw us for about 2-3 hours (not even exaggerating). She was eventually transferred (because we became too annoying I guess) to an observation unit overnight. I had to go home cause they wouldn't let me stay. The next day, I got there, my sister was a effing shell of herself. She was literally gray and said the pain was still there, she just didn't have the energy to fight it anymore. I told her since she was in the hospital, at least she was safe, but she told me she legitimately thought she was going to die. A day later, she calls me - they finally did an ultrasound after THREE DAYS (apparently NZ hospitals have no ultrasound technicians on for holiday periods?) and told me her ovary was twisted around a ridiculous amount of times. She said they have to operate 'right effing now'. She's lucky to be alive. The hospital wouldn't allow us to have any documentation about her operation or anything. They told us it was not her information to have. The fact that the doctor wrote her off as having an STD, and never looked into anything else until the last moment when she was going septic, sickens the eff out of me. And the fact ovarian torsion is a medical emergency whilst we were being told there were bigger things to worry about... I'm just glad she's still effing here."

She had a scarf on, so at a glance she just looked normal, but she definitely unbuttoned her shirt almost all the way down. Right before entering my classroom alone. I honestly thought for a second that the school may have paid her to test how much integrity I had as a male. It was uncomfortable. Edit should have been more clear.
School policy was to keep the door open when alone with any students, regardless of gender, which it was. It was right after school, so there was still a lot of activity in the hallways. Her being in there with the door open wasn't out of the ordinary at all. The way she was sitting, kept anyone in the hallway from seeing what she had done, which made it even more awkward.

My Aunt is a poisonous woman. Our whole family doesn’t talk to her. She’s done things in the past you wouldn’t believe. So she left our lives years ago. Recently she returned out of the blue at my moms house. My mom has 2 other sisters and a brother. My mom and aunt never got on. My mom is a lovely person but she could sense from a young age something was off about her sister, so she kept her distance.
My Aunt was nasty and would hurt people’s feelings intentionally for no reason. She never had a partner or kids. She isolated herself from everyone. My Gran cut her off when she tried to steal thousands of dollars from her. We all genuinely think there’s something physiologically wrong with her.
So back to where I was going with this....one morning I was at my moms house. Just chilling out and there was a knock at the door. So I opened it and there she was. She walked in, she looked like she had taken substances. She looked dead behind the eyes. I tried to stop her but she pushed me down. I honestly don’t know why she came to my moms house out of everyone. I quickly got up and she went into the kitchen. She startled my mom and punched her in the face. My mom didn’t even have a chance to blink before she hit her. She went down like a ton of bricks.
My heart felt like it had been sucked through into my stomach when I saw it. Something came over me, I don’t know if it was anger or adrenaline, but I ran up behind her and grabbed her hair and I dragged her out onto the back lawn and I bashed her face about 15 times, blood was everywhere. Thankfully no one saw me or I might not have been writing this right now. I got up and I left her there. I went to check on my mom, she was in a lot of pain. I looked back out the window and she was gone.
We told our family immediately about this and they were perplexed and angry as to why she just turned up and attacked my mom. I’m still so hurt and angry as I write this. But I also feel tremendously guilty and upset that I did that to her because I’ve never fought anyone and I’m not a fighter at all, but something came over me and I snapped.
I can’t get over it for some reason. It just seemed so unreal and there was no reason for the attack. God forbid she had a weapon that’s truly scary to think about. We didn’t call the police. As I assaulted her badly and didn’t want it to bounce back on me. That’s another thing I feel ashamed about.
But should I feel bad or not? I need others' opinions as I’ve been bottling this up for a while.
My Gran was devastated, she just wanted her daughter back but from a young age she took to substances, spent time in prison and a number of other things. You can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be saved."

The family's schedule is arranged such that the moment the family leaves the house on the day of travel, a whole team of people rushes through and packs up all the remaining items (only after the family leaves, you wouldn't want to deny them access to their items for even a few seconds) which are then sent ahead to the airport while the family has a lunch or something somewhere. Upon landing, their luggage takes one route (direct) and the family takes a similarly indirect route (unless otherwise directed) such that by the time they get to the location all of their items are not just unpacked but in their proper organized locations and ready for use without any of the advanced team ever being visible to the family.
What happens when the family leaves the location? The same situation in reverse, but quite frequently all of the repurchased items are just disposed of in some method. It's just easier, if not cheaper, to rebuy them each time the family goes somewhere if they aren't travelling to too many different locations in quick succession."
  the person expresses growing resentment towards their autistic best friend due to the friend's self-centered behavior and lack of reciprocity.,"I’m starting to hate my autistic best friend

I feel like I’m a jerk for this but I’m really starting to hate my autistic best friend. She self-diagnosed herself a couple of years ago, which is fine by me, I really don’t care about that. But I’ve been thinking about our friendship and I’m really beginning to hate her but I feel like it’s wrong because she is autistic and I know she has trouble with social cues so it isn’t her fault necessarily. However, she treats me really awful and I’m really getting fed up with it. We met from a mutual friend and quickly became close, we would just share memes and talk about stuff we liked. However, I realized it was very one sided pretty quickly. Throughout our friendship, I feel like I am always the one to contribute. I have bought her lots of gifts throughout our friendship; clothes, stuffed animals, shoes, etc, yet she has never once given me a gift of any sort. She just talks about herself, how hot she is, details about her intimate life, what she is doing, and what she’s up to, but never asks about me or what I’m doing. I feel like I can’t even talk to her about anything because it just turns into her talking about herself. I once told her that my mom had just fallen into a coma and I was really stressed out and worried, and all she did was say “uh oh” then started to talk about how hot she looked in an outfit. Another time, I told her that I had just gotten into a car accident and was a bit shaken up, and she didn’t even acknowledge it and just started to talk about the intimacy she had the night before. I started a new birth control and it sent me into a depressive spiral just from the new hormones, I told her about it but in response, she sent me photos of her butt and asked if she was thick or not. A few years ago, I was in a depressive spiral and attempted to un-alive and was hospitalized, when I was back home and I texted her why I was gone for a few days, she just heart reacted my message and then started talking about her breasts and how she thought they were getting bigger. Things like this just constantly add up and make me feel like she doesn’t even see me as a person. I once told her about 2 years ago that I felt like she doesn’t treat me equally in our friendship, and she told me that it was her autism that makes it hard to have relationships and that I can’t be upset at her for it since she cannot control it. I just feel like a jerk if I was to cut off the friendship since I do understand she has autism and relationships/social cues are difficult, but I don’t even feel respected whatsoever and it depresses me to be friends with someone like this."
"  friend's pregnancy revealed to be a result of a gang assault, leading to a difficult decision and lasting emotional consequences.","What was the hardest thing you had to tell someone?

My best friend was assaulted repeatedly as a teenager. First by a group of men at a party, where she was laced, and then four weeks later by someone she trusted. In both cases, violent, physically forceful rope, though she ended up 'dating' the second rapist for a while. (He was abusive and had convinced her she couldn't do better.) She lived in another country at the time, and while she was visiting me, she revealed that she was pregnant. She had done a pregnancy test after the gang rope as well as after her ""boyfriend""'s rope, and then tested negative after the first and positive after the second. She was considering keeping the child, but she wasn't in a good mental state, so we went to an abortion clinic for her to talk to a doctor and potentially schedule an abortion, without telling her parents or mine. We were both under 18, but it was legal. I accompanied her to the clinic and translated for her. I had mentioned to the doctor that she was about four weeks pregnant. Yet when the doctor did the ultrasound, she looked at me and said in my language: ""Well, she's definitely eight weeks pregnant, so that changes some of our options."" Without translating for my friend at this moment, I told the doctor again, no, that's not possible, the incident only happened four weeks ago… That's when it dawned on me. She thought she was at least pregnant from an assault by her 'boyfriend'. But she wasn't. She was pregnant from one of the men who gang assaulted her; no idea which one it could even be. I asked my friend when she had taken the test. She said ""the day after"". Turns out she didn't realize pregnancy tests take ten days or so before they reliably show anything, so she had taken the test after the gang assault much too early. That's when I asked the doctor to give us a few minutes and I had to tell her what was really going on. I'll never forget the feeling of her crying on my shoulder, her hand weakly digging into my back, trying to hold herself up. She ended up having the abortion, but she was never the same person again after that summer."
"  couple's relationship began with infidelity, but it gradually deteriorated due to manipulation, abuse, isolation, and constant accusations of cheating.","What was the final straw in your relationship?

It started nicely enough - I had a crush on her for about 4 years, but she was married and I wasn't going to be the one to step into that. Found out she had moved out, was separating, etc, and had just started dating a mutual friend. He told me, because he knew I'd liked her for a while, and I told him I wasn't going to not go after her. A couple days later, we're banging. She leaves our mutual friend (who she'd been with for like a week), hooks up with me. He's angry, bitter, but gets over it after a couple years. We move in together, I get on great with her kids (still do), and things seem pretty good. The decline was subtle. Frighteningly so. It started with her guilting me for not spending enough time with her. Now, I wasn't out at all hours, but I worked in food service and she worked retail. The hours we were together changed daily, because set schedules are taboo for some reason in those industries. So I would cancel plans with friends when I could be with her. After a while she had managed to cause me to alienate all of my friends - even my two closest childhood friends I saw maybe 5 times over the 2 year span right in the middle of our relationship. These were people I'd hung out with daily leading up to dating her. Other friends got married, and I declined to go because she didn't want to. I missed out on a lot. I started resenting her, but when I brought it up she would tell me I was being selfish. I resorted to sneaking around to go enjoy my hobbies. I'm a musician, and when I went to the first concert I'd attended in 2 years she made me feel like a prick because I wasn't home with her. She was effing working. I told her as much, which is when the hitting started. She had always been kind of rough, and I thought I liked that. She'd hit me jokingly, but she had never hit me out of anger. When I finally dared show her a fault in her logic though, the fight quickly escalated to me backed into a corner and her wailing on me. I wasn't going to hit back, I effing loved her, I'd never want to do anything to hurt her. And if she's this mad, maybe she's right, I was wrong for going to the show. And it kept up like that. Finally I started doubting my own judgment and memory. I believed what she told me happened, rather than what I knew happened. I believed my motives were whatever she said, rather than what I knew they were. I don't have an exact moment that I started losing interest in her romantically. At some point the intercourse dwindled off to maybe once a week, then once a month. I didn't see her as the girl I loved, she was my gaoler. Though I still hadn't consciously come to that conclusion. She had just beaten and manipulated every ounce of energy and love I had for her out of me. Her conclusion? I was beating too much. I wasn't interested in her because I was interested in other women, and was busy fapping to them. I had an intercourse addiction. She got me to go to effing meetings for this crap. She wanked over my browser history and once kicked the crap out of me because the last window I had closed was a tiny pop-up ad, which means when I opened a new browser window it went to that small size. She goes, ""there's only one reason you would have the browser that small!"" And proceeds to lay into me. She became hyper-religious, but only about this one thing, and got me to go to church (I was raised Catholic, so God-guilt seemed like a natural thing, and I had never questioned religion up to that point - still wouldn't til years after). She convinced me to quit my job of 2 years because she was convinced I wanted to sleep with one of my coworkers. After that I couldn't keep a job for more than a couple weeks without it throwing her into a jealous rage because I just happened to work with a woman. Accusations began to fly that I was cheating on her, or was thinking of other women when I was with her. She began insisting that we open the relationship so she can be satisfied, since I wasn't man enough to do it. She started inviting friends over (this would be the start of the final year with her) and would sit there and tell them in great detail about what a effup I was and how I wouldn't eff her. Around this time I proposed - I still don't know what the eff I was thinking - maybe I hoped she would chill out if there was a ring."
"  parents threaten divorce if child doesn't end college relationship, resulting in abuse and temporary refuge with girlfriend's supportive family.","My parents will divorce if I don't break up with my (21m) girlfriend (19f).

I have a girlfriend at college, and my parents don't approve of our relationship at all. Last few weeks they've been furious about it, and threatening to divorce. They told me not to date until I get my bachelor's (which is at least one semester from now), and to date only Asian (preferably Chinese American) girls. I'm Asian, and she's white. We didn't even do anything inappropriate- we're just close friends, often hang out together on campus, and we're in a swing dance club. I didn't even tell my parents about my relationship. How did they find out? My sister (18f) also goes to same college as me, and she always saw me walking around holding hands and eating in the cafeteria with the same girl. Instead of asking me about it she told my parents. She took pictures of us from afar, and used it as evidence against me. When I told my parents that both my girlfriend and I are legal adults, and that her parents approve of the relationship, they said, ""you'll always be a child in our eyes, and her parents don't influence us"". They're primarily mad because I kept my relationship a secret for so long, and secondary reason is that I'm breaking their expectations about dating.
My grades are fine (I have a 3.83 GPA and got a summer internship), and I've never gotten in trouble at school. What's worse is that my sister was allowed to date as early as her freshman year in high school. She's even invited her boyfriends home and slept in the same bed as them, and went on vacations with their families. She's had like 3 boyfriends already, as she gets into dating drama frequently. When I, 3 years older than her, asked my parents if I could date, they said no, because they don't want me getting in trouble. She did mediocre in high school and barely squeaked out a 3.0 her first semester in college.
When I told my parents that I love my girlfriend and I'm not breaking up with her, they said that they will divorce each other if I don't break up with her ASAP. They were forcing me to pull out my phone and text her, saying that I want to break up. I refused, arguing that they let my irresponsible, academically struggling younger sister date, but not me. My parents said that I value ""white trash"" over family, and that they spent 21 years raising a failure. (I'm not a failure; my sister is)
My dad hit me several times, giving me a black eye, while my mom lied on the floor crying, saying that she wishes she aborted me. Then he argued with my mom and screamed at each other. Meanwhile I grabbed my backpack with my stuff in it and drove off to my girlfriend's house about 90 minutes away. My parents fortunately don't know where she lives. When he noticed my car was missing, he called me but I didn't pick up. Then he texted me asking where I am, and said that he would come get me. I told my girlfriend's family what happened, and they offered to let me stay with them until we go back to campus. My mom later texted me to inform me that my parents have filed a missing person report against me. I texted back, saying that I'm at my girlfriend's place, and that they can't stop me.
I got my girlfriend's dad to call my parents, and he told them to F off, and that if they keep treating me like this they will take legal action themselves. I know it's only because she and I are very committed in our relationship, and her parents are supportive of it."
"  how being extremely attractive can have negative consequences, as it can lead to jealousy, false accusations, and destructive relationships.




","What is a generally attractive trait that you DON'T want in a partner?

Being REALLY good looking. I have a friend with this curse. I call it a curse because it has ruined his life. He is abnormally attractive. He could be the poster boy for any magazine or advertisement without make up or other assistance. Women would flock to him. Being around him was always like being in the movies. Attractive women would come up between us, sitting at a normal restaurant, and tell him how good he smelled and ask him for his number. It was always a thing I was jealous of. He was married to a nice Japanese lady. So he would always politely turn women down. He was no cheater, though he could easily cheat often if you wanted to. She eventually became jealous, much like you are talking about, and convinced herself that he was cheating on her. He wasn’t. All the time that he wasn’t with her he was with me, and he wouldn’t do that. He wasn’t that kind of person. Anyways, they divorced, he loved her. But she wanted to go her own way. He later married a beautiful girl, she was a divorce lawyer, which is probably a horrible choice in the first place. She too convinced herself that he was cheating on her. He wasn’t. But she drove herself to insanity. Following him around. They had a daughter. She eventually couldn’t prove that he was cheating on her, which he wasn’t, so she started doing dirty lawyer stuff. Every time she scratched herself or bumped into a wall, every bruise she ever got from opening a car door wrong or whatever, she would photograph it. She built this case of abuse against him. It’s important to know that this guy was in the military. So one day she pressed charges of assault against him and domestic violence. All of it was bullshit. And it was dismissed in the civilian court. But the military doesn’t care what civilian courts say. He spent months in the brig, awaiting trial. At the end of the court case, they ask him if he had anything else to say to her, and he just begged her to go away, please leave me alone, and go away, take what you want, go away please stop trying to destroy me. She cackled like a witch in front of the judge and everyone. It was dismissed and he went back to serving and eventually retired a few years later. But she took everything from him, including his daughter. Somehow managing to get 100% custody and she doesn’t allow visitation somehow. He’s in his 40s now, still good looking, has a nice girlfriend and a good paying job, but he’s emotionally in shambles and will never recover is my guess. Cursed with beauty."
"  unknowingly labeled as a girlfriend, their casual friend's hasty assumption led to an awkward encounter and a swift, relieving breakup.","Whats The Dumbest Reason You’ve been Broken Up With?

I have a good one. This one time in college I was hanging out a casual friend's house, doing nothing much but smoking za za and watching The Daily Show. My friend turns to me and says
""By the way I told my folks we're dating now, and they think you're great and want you to come over for lasagna. I told them I wasn't sure if we were ready for dinner with the parents yet so we don't have to go.""
I was shocked, because it was news to me that we were dating. Like literally nothing about our interactions were flirty or affectionate, or even frequent. So I mumbled something about
""Uh yeah I don't feel great about having dinner with your parents""
and got out of there. then spent the next week trying to figure out what to do about it, not seeing the guy except in mutual classes. Finally I figured, screw it, l'm in college, I guess I could give it a shot and no big deal if it doesn't go anywhere. So I tell my roommates that I'm dating the dude, and it's super new but maybe he'll be coming around to hang out. They teased me about it and I felt super uncomfortable, seeing as I didn't exactly walk into that relationship with much in the way of enthusiasm. I headed out to my evening class. On my way to the class my then accidental boyfriend came running up to me outside the building. I said hey and gave him an awkward hug. He looked really serious so I asked him if everything was Okay. He said no, then we had a chat about how everything was moving way too fast, and he wasn't ready for anything intense and serious since he and his fiancee had split up the year before. I mean I knew this dude so casually that I had no idea he'd ever had a fiancee. Anyway he broke up with me because we were moving to fast and it was too intense for him to handle. I don't think l've ever felt such a rush of relief in my life. Until I got home that night. I still had to explain to my roommates that I'd gotten dumped by a dude I hadn't even realized I was dating. I still haven't lived it down with them."
"  living with an immature roommate lacking common sense and basic life skills, roommate's wealthy upbringing sheltered her from independence.




","Who is the most immature adult you’ve ever met?

Who is the most immature adult you’ve ever met? I had a roommate who had no common sense. She honestly didn’t know things that children would know. It wasn’t her fault, she came from a very wealthy family. They wanted her to be a tennis pro, so they sent her to private schools throughout her life. She was on my university’s tennis team and she was very good. Her parents had paid for her to live in a dorm on campus her first three years of college. By the time she reached her senior year of college, she’d never done anything for herself in her life. She was 22. That’s when I met her. I put an ad out online because the person me and my other roommate had previously lived with graduated the semester before and moved out. A girl named Hannah replied to the ad. She was cute and nice so we let her sign a contract and move in with us. Sometimes I felt like I was raising an 8 year old, living with her. She kept not paying rent. I’d get a notice from the landlord saying a portion of the rent hadn’t been paid. I’d tell my roommate she needed to pay and she’d pay immediately. This happened for three months in a row. Finally, I said “Hannah, I’m not your mom. I can’t remind you to pay rent every month. You need to do it yourself.” Her eyes got really big. She said “Oh, I didn’t know that rent had to be paid at a certain time every month.” She used to make giant pots of soup and leave them on the stove for days, unrefrigerated. I got concerned and told her she shouldn’t eat something that had been sitting out uncovered for three days. She was confused. I had to explain to her how she’d probably get very sick and food can go bad if it’s not refrigerated properly or not eaten for too long. After that, my other friend left some soup in our fridge that she wanted to come back and pick up the next day. When I came home the next day, Hannah was eating it. I said “Hannah, why are you eating my friends soup? She said she was going to pick it up today.” Hannah replied, “Well I took the soup out of the fridge and left it on the counter because I knew she was going to come pick it up. But she didn’t come for a while, so I figured the soup was going bad like you told me, so I thought I’d eat it.” I just replied “Why didn’t you just leave it in the fridge until she arrived?” Hannah apparently never thought of that. Once some mice invaded our home. Hannah left her food in the cupboards uncovered, like her rice and cereal. I told her she had to box them up or the mice would get in her food and poop in it and make her sick. She tied some rubber bands around some of her food but that was it. I had to secure all of her food for her because I worried about her, and I wanted the mice gone. Another time, we went on a hike together and saw a tent made to look like a teepee in the forest. She asked “Do you think pilgrims live in there?” I’m pretty sure she meant Amish people, but either way, I was dumbfounded. Up to a year after we were roommates, she would call me asking me about random bills that got charged to her that didn’t relate to me at all. I couldn’t believe some of the stuff she got into just because she had no common sense. The thing is, she was pretty book smart. She got good grades in her major. She was amazing at tennis which takes intelligence. She just had zero common sense. I had never met someone like that before. I was basically her caretaker all year. She was super sweet and I liked her, but wow did I get annoyed with her sometimes. Anyways, she’s probably going to become a pro tennis player now. She’ll have a coach or enough money to have other people handle her life for her, so I think she’s going to turn out okay."

What's the most ridiculous thing you've heard a parent say when fighting for custody in court? My ex. He actually tried to get full custody of our daughters. One was almost 18 and one was almost 16. He shared an apartment with 5 other men all in their 40’s. The only space my ex had that was his own was his bedroom. Living room, kitchen, bathroom was all shared space. He thought that by getting custody he would get child support and alimony from me. I however had an apartment for just me and the kids. They each had their own rooms and no one else lived with us. He tried asking the court for a home study to decide who the kids should live with. My daughters spoke with my lawyer. Who in turn spoke with his lawyer. His lawyer finally convinced him it wouldn’t go well to pursue that in court. He would lose and then have to pay the costs of the home study. I got the kids, the dogs, the tools and by time my ex finished dragging the whole thing out my oldest was over 18 and no longer part of the custody agreement. I might add that I specifically worded the custody arrangement. There were no set days he got to see my youngest. It was at her discretion if she wanted to spend time with him, talk to him or have any contact with him. She didn’t and hasn’t to this day almost 10 years later. He was (and still is) a violent, mean drunk drug addict who has never admitted to having a problem, has never held a job (except for one time) for longer than 3 months. The one time he did? I drove him to work every day and picked him up after. He hung on to it for a year. He will lie, cheat and steal to feed his habit. Once he called his mother, gave her this BS story about how he and his new GF had moved to Florida (they had) and all he needed was my youngest’s Social Security Number and Florida welfare would send her a check every month. She actually had the nerve to call and ask for the number! My daughter was smart enough not to give it to her. I called my ex-MIL later that day and asked her just how stupid she was. Florida wasn’t going to send a check to NJ. He was trying to claim that my daughter lived with him in Florida to scam welfare. I called Florida the very next day. I sent a copy of the divorce decree and gave them my ex’s name and Social Security Number (I knew it because I always filled out any paperwork for us including tax returns) and told them in no uncertain terms that none of my children lived with him in that state and he did not have the legal right to any benefits for them. The damage he could have done with that number. Credit cards in her name when she turned 18. Loans."
  self-sufficiency and happiness before pursuing relationships are crucial lessons learned from observing a content single friend and an insecure one.,"What is something you have learned about relationships while you were single?

What is something you have learned about relationships while you were single? As I was sitting on the beach with my friend Courtney, she turned to me and said, “You know, I really love Landon. I'm going to marry him. But, if he were to leave me, I would be okay.” They had been dating for four years and her boyfriend was asking her dad that summer if he could have her hand in marriage. They were very happy and comfortable together. It was a stark contrast to my old roommate. In the four years I had known her, she had been single less than two weeks. Every time she became single, it had not been her choice. After each breakup, she had immediately gotten a new man within days. Eventually she settled with a guy who emotionally abused her. She had eventually caught him cheating more than three times and broken up with him, but her fear of being alone had driven her back into his arms after ten days. She married that guy. Both of these girls are wonderful people who I enjoy hanging out with. But, they have one stark difference. Courtney is comfortable being alone. My old roommate is not. Courtney dated her share of frogs but was always able to leave if things got bad. She liked being single and was comfortable with herself. So, she found a man perfect for her who added something amazing to her life. She settled for nothing less. My old roommate stayed in abusive relationship after abusive relationship. Being single scared her, so she'd rather stay with someone who treated her badly than face the world alone. She will depend on someone else for her happiness for the rest of her life and they will consistently fail to provide it. Being single taught me that you're not ready to be in a relationship unless you're truly happy and comfortable being single. If you don't, you make yourself very vulnerable to abuse and a life of heartache. Learn to be alone and to depend on yourself. Don't date anyone before you date yourself. It is the most important basis of a healthy relationship."
"  the physician discovered a massive tumor in a young woman's pelvis, implying a terminal diagnosis.","What is the most bitter truth that you had to reveal to your patient as a medical professional? 

Early in my medical career of 35 years as a family physician I had a woman come to me who was in her mid-20s. Her complaint was that her jeans did not fit well. Usually a person would take a look at another human being and think, “well, you could lose a few pounds.” But thankfully I did not do that, or if I did it, it never came out of my mouth. What came out of my mouth was, “What have you noticed? Specifically?” And that led to comments that she mainly thought that the left side of her back was different than her right side of her back, in a bulging sort of way. I looked at her, and indeed it was very obvious that there was a bulge that made the normal contour of her right buttocks to her back change dramatically into the appearance of a mass pushing the left side of her back backwards. She said that sometimes it hurt a little to take a step. And so I ordered a plain film x-ray of her pelvis thinking that maybe we could catch the problem with that. At that time we had the x-ray machine right down the hall so all I had to do was see another patient and then come back to her. The film was outside of her door. I put it up in the view box. Most of the left part of her pelvis posteriorly was completely missing. There was a monstrous tumor that had invaded it and destroyed the bone. Where her sacrum ended, it seemed to attach to nothing. I have no idea how she could walk at all let alone only experience a little pain once in a while. This explained the bulging of her lower back. And also explained even to her that she would probably be dying from this cancer. But that’s not what you say on day one, on day one I said that we needed to get her referred to someone for a biopsy. I never saw her again."
  a voicemail: Daughter attacked at school. Staff negligence led to racial incident. Officer's intervention brought justice and consequences for school staff.,"What is the most disturbing message ever left on your voicemail? 

From my (at the time) 13-year-old daughter on a normal 8 a.m.-3 p.m. school day. Around 11 a.m.: “Mama, please answer. I'm using some construction worker’s phone and he needs it back soon. I need you to pick me up. I'm a block away from school and my nose won't stop bleeding. Please please please call this number back.” I was at work and not near my cellphone. Six minutes later: “Mama...please. My phone was stolen and I don't remember your work number. Please don't be mad. I walked out of school and the truancy officer keeps driving around. These workers are helping my nosebleed and blocking me from view of the truancy officer..but, hang on, this guy wants to say something.” “Hello ma'am. My name is Jim #### with $$$$ Construction. Don't worry, she's in good hands. I have three daughters around her age. Your daughter needs to see a doctor — they got her pretty good. I don't have the whole story but all I know is that your daughter was attacked and jumped by a few girls at school. Her injuries aren't severe but should be looked at. She left school because the people in the office wouldn't allow her to contact you. Thank you.” When I tell you that day sucked, I'm not lying lol. I left work after being alerted by a co-worker that my phone was lit up. I checked voicemail, left work and headed straight to her school. Surprisingly, the police were waiting for me to arrive. I'm not going to go into full detail but apparently my daughter stood up for another girl who was getting picked on. The bullies turned their anger towards my daughter. After class 4–5 girls surrounded her on the steps and knocked her books out of her hand. When she bent down to pick them up, her hair was being pulled one way and her legs another. They dragged her down the steps each taking turns hitting and kicking her. Her cellphone and shoes were stolen. She got back on her feet somehow and said that she started throwing punches in the air until she made contact, and she kept going until she stopped getting beat on. Apparently the Principal only witnessed my daughter's final blows and two girls fleeing. She didn't even follow up and ask my daughter's story... only the “innocent victims’”. Many things were said by me to the people in the office. Some might say that I was just a concerned mother within my rights. Maybe so... But at the time I immediately felt bad. Surprisingly the officer didn't stop me.. So I guess I was justified. I recall using the words “incompetent, unprofessional, and undeserving of that position” several times.. But that was the extent. Harsh words for me either way. The officer told me to take her to the hospital and someone would come up to question her about what happened. Long story short. . . the doctor examining her said that based on the injuries of all six girls, it was determined that my daughter acted in self defense. The doctor gave her a lollipop and called her “slugger”. He sent her out of the room, told me to take her out of that school immediately because based on the testimony by the office people, it would only get worse. I didn't quite have a full grasp on what he was trying to say until later. It turns out that out of the six involved, my daughter suffered the least amount of injury... meaning that she caused more harm to the five than the five did to her. The girls blamed my daughter for the entire incident and the office workers backed up their story without even checking with my daughter. My daughter left school because they brought her to the office, called her white trash, called the police blaming her, and told her she couldn't call me because they didn't need any more “racist redneck honkeys” to come up there and throw around their white privilege. Thankfully the African American officer who was in the office waiting for me earlier continued with the investigation after hearing from the doctor. He found my daughter innocent, told the women that their attitudes were a part of the reason why people of color aren't taken seriously, then he reported them to the board of education causing them to lose their jobs. I'll never understand that type of hate from either direction. This world really sucks. Everyone's heart produces the same colored blood."
"  roommate's sneaky behavior results in owing $400, suspension for underage drinking, and potential identity theft charges.","Roommate thought she was sneaky. Ended up owing me $400 and got suspended.

This is a long one, tldr is below.
So, this happened my second semester dorming at my college campus. I had met my roommate at orientation and could kind of already tell she was going to be a pain in my ass. And I was right about that. I had planned on moving rooms to be closer to some friends the next semester.
But, let me get to the story that lead to my revenge. On our campus you had to pay for meals using your student ID which had a certain amount of money on it each semester. You could also use an app that you put your name and ID info into and it makes it easier to pay. But, the name and ID must match for it to work (which will be important later).
Any funds from the fall semester would roll over into the spring. But, then at the end of spring it would just expire. Because of this, and because I only ate once or two a day, I had a ton saved up on my card. My roommate on the other hand, did not. So, I offered to pay for some of her meals from time to time in trade of her picking up the food for us. Which involved her using my card twice in person and then she'd return it . Then, one day, I noticed on my app that my card was being charged even when I was not ordering food. And not just a meal, like a meal for several people. This meant that whoever was ordering (I wonder who) either had to have stolen my ID card (which I had in my pocket when I got the charge) or was impersonating my info in the app, which are both big nonos on my campus. I was quick to put two and two together and was pretty pissed. I was initially going to confront her on it. But decided to formulate a plan instead.
That day I went and ordered a second ID card for $25 to use for later. As it took a couple of weeks to get the new one. I let her charge several things to my card over a good two weeks. For her and her friends. And she wasn't very good at hiding it either. As they would come to our dorm and eat. While I just screenshot and sent emails to the support team of the app about the charges (knowing nothing would get done until I contacted someone in person). And one day it got even better, as you can buy groceries with the card off campus as well. She decided to pay for alcohol with my card. Which doesn't get pinged as an issue on my card due to me being over 21 but, she was only 19. Not sure how she got it, but it was just the thing to finally act on my plan.
I put my best sad face on and contacted the head of campus living and head of my dorm about the charges on my account. I dropped some hints that it could be my roommate and mentioned I got a new ID and asked what I should do. I was told to order a new card and once I got it, to deactivate my current ID and use the new one for purchases now. Making my old ID have a balance of $0 and also to ping if someone uses it to buy anything. They also told me they would be visiting my dorm to discuss the issue with my roommate. I accepted that and waited.
They sent the confirmation email that they would be visiting and I just decided to add more fuel to the fire . My roommate was groaning about not having the funds for food in front of me in our dorm. I told her I really couldn't help her as I was running low on funds and she kind of just laughed it off and left the room to probably go use my old ID. I deactivated my first card right after she left and surprise surprise she used my info to pay. Except when she tried to pay for her and her friends this time , it was declined and it pinged that my ID was used. Campus security was called and she was escorted back to our dorm. Pretty much perfect timing for our meeting with campus living. She was scared shitless when they came to the dorm to talk and look through her stuff.
On her phone, still logged into the app was my ID information and name. And in her dorm closet was a half full bottle of cheap vodka. And on my phone was a screenshot of said unauthorized vodka purchase.
In the end she was forced to pay me back all the funds she used (in cash) , reported for underage drinking which automatically suspends you from campus living for atleast a year, and would have on her record that she performed Identity theft. Which I also could have charged her for out of school.
In the end, I got to have my own dorm for the remainder of that semester and even part of the semester after. Because it wasn't put as an available room for new dormers. I did get all my money back (from her parents) who were so embarrassed and apologized profusely. And when she did eventually come back to campus no one wanted to dorm with her because they knew she had stolen her roommates ID. I think in the end she rented off campus."
"  stepfather reflects on stepson's act of self-defense against a bully, leading to years of guilt, isolation, and sorrow.




","Parents of murderers, how do you view your son/daughter now?

My step son killed one of his bullies in high school. He has a cleft palate, and it's a pretty bad one. All his life he's been bullied for it. His mother and I have done everything we could to stop the bullying but it never ceased. We contacted administrators, moved, switched schools, tried everything. Eventually, we decided on an online homeschooling program. Unfortunately, one of his bullies from his last school knew where we lived. 
He'd come by and taunt my step son regularly. My wife and I were never around because the kid would come while we were working. One day, after my son tried ignoring his previous taunting, the bully figured it must have been a good idea to break in and find him. He threw a brick through our back window, which was in the guest bedroom, and proceeded to attempt to enter.
Now, I partially blamw my self for what happened next. My son never knew his real father, and so since I've come in, I've done everything in my power to fill in, and we grew pretty close. I ended up trusting him enough to tell him where I kept my gun. Seeing as how his mother and I worked so often, I wanted him to be able to protect himself if anything were to happen if we were gone. So, he grabs my gun, opens the door to where the bully was and shot him in the chest twice. He died before the ambulance reached the scene. My son was never charged for anything, as there was obvious evidence of a forced entry, and the neighbors claim that the bully repeatedly said he was gonna kill my son when he got inside. 
This happened almost 10 years ago when my son was 15. He's been to so many different psychologists and therapist since then. Something in him changed that day, like he blamed himself. For years he tried to isolate himself from the world, he became a heavy alcoholic, and even attempted to kill himself. He blames himself for taking another humans life even though he knows his was in danger. Seeing what happened to my boy, it's heartbreaking. I sold the gun, never got another one. To this day, he still has that look of grief and guilt in his eyes. I'm starting to believe no amount of tears will ever wash it away."
"  person's conservative parents' transphobia leads to a rift with their trans sister, resulting in a wedding invitation dilemma.","I banned My Trans Sister From Coming To My Wedding.

I have a trans sister who came out to us around a year ago but had been on hormones for longer and hid it from us until she had moved out into her own place, probably because our parents are very conservative and known to be transphobic. As a result, there was this huge fight and a ton of people in our family (including our parents) cut her off and didn't talk to her anymore.
I like to think I've been pretty supportive of her so far, using her pronouns and her name and all that (which has been hard, considering our fam gives me shit for doing so). I even make it a point to visit her every so often, while she hasn't seen most of our other family since last year. I also promised her that, if and when I get married in the future, she'd still be invited despite any tension with our family.
Me and my fiancé got engaged a while back. My parents (especially my dad) absolutely adore this guy, and since my sister came out, they've almost seen him as the substitute son. Almost as a result, he's definitely more on their side of the situation, and he's made it clear he doesn't really agree with, or like, my sister all that much.
After the proposal (which was very elaborate and surprising and orchestrated by my parents), my parents, who are wedding planners, started talking with me about planning the big day and even offered to pay for everything. I mentioned wanting to invite my sister, and they shut the idea down immediately, talking about how she disrespected the family and cut them off and all that. They basically gave me an ultimatum: have my wedding planned and paid for by them or have my sister there and they don't come at all.
I took my parents' offer, because I can't really afford to pay for an entire wedding and because my fiancé pressured me to accept it. I broke the news to my sister, and she's very understandably upset, but I'm still inviting her to a smaller afterparty over Zoom so we can still be together on the big day. I still feel really guilty about this, though, so, Reddit, Am I a hole?"
"  narrator shares a terrifying experience living with someone who believed he was Jesus, leading to a dangerous situation.","Redditors related to a psychopath, what is your creepiest “Holy Crap, This Might Be My End” story?

my mother dated a crazy person after her divorce. We moved into an apartment and he moved in with us not long after.
He had long hair and blue eyes and a beard and was the spitting image of “White Jesus.”
And he took it to heart after a few people told him about the resemblance.
He pulled me aside one day and told me that he had a secret and he wanted to tell me but I couldn’t tell anyone else because the government was looking for him. He confided in me that he was in fact Jesus Christ and the he escaped from a government facility after being captured in 1964. He said he escaped with the help of the Pope during his visit to the USA. The Popes private security force broke him out and once he was free the Pope advised him to blend in with regular people. He said the Pope told him to not draw any attention to himself...so no miracles...and tell no one. But he trusted me with this information.
Jesus Christ was a roofer in case you were curious.
He constantly carried around his roofing hammer and one day it went missing.
Jesus lost it.
He locked my mother, my girlfriend, and myself in our apartment until it was found. This lasted 3 days. I was 18 at the time and was much larger then him and would have had no problem physically removing Jesus from our apartment but my Mother insisted he was having a mental episode and if I hurt him or did anything it may mess him up even worse.
Turns out he left the Hammer (which is really pretty much a hatchet) at a job site and a co-worker drove over to return it.
I sat there like an idiot and watched this guy hand a fucking axe to this lunatic and did nothing. Big mistake.
Our three day long lockdown turned into 5 days. The final 2 days was this illiterate nutcase attempting to read aloud from the Bible getting maybe 1 in 5 words right. Remember in school when the teacher would have people read aloud and go around the room and there was always a dude you knew couldn’t read for shit and his part would last ten times longer than everyone else’s part? Imagine that for 48 hours.
Jesus would only let us eat bread and water. And the bread ran out quickly.
There was a lake outside our apartment and on the 5th day Jesus was looking through the blinds at the lake and called me over to him. He confided in me again.
He said “you know I could walk right across that lake and right up Into heaven.”
I replied...”If you do that I’ll follow you anywhere...go for it man I would love to see you do that.”
My plan was to get him out of the apartment and lock the door so my mom and girlfriend would be safe...and prey to this guys dad that I can run faster then him and make it to a pay phone to call 911.
He looked at me with his crazy ass eyes and said “YOU TRYING TO GET ME CAUGHT? I SAID NO MIRACLES!”
He raised up his roofing hammer and told me the only way I was following him anywhere was in the afterlife. It was at that point I thought this it it and then he is going to unalivel my mother and girlfriend.
I came to the sudden realization that I no longer cared if Jesus's mental breakdown would be affected by me beating the crap out of him or not. That was no longer my problem. Mid rant about some religious shit about two inches from my face...I swung as hard as I could and punched him right in the sternum. He still had the hatchet over his shoulder (like someone throwing a football) so the blow caused him to lose his balance and fall over a dining room chair.
He crumpled in a heap and my mother...ever the cool head...screamed at me for hitting him. I had knocked the wind out of him and he was gasping for air. My mother assumed he was dying. I would learn later in adulthood my mother was not the brightest lightbulb.
My girlfriend booked out the door with me close behind after grabbing my mother’s arm and dragging her out of the door.
I called the police and they came and got him.
Last I heard he was in a hospital after he locked himself in a bedroom still saying he was Jesus. He was committed after he used a metal throwing dart to pick veins out of his arm."

","What is the most outrageous/stupid thing you have done in hopes of having sex?

I was at a club with some buddies and my new girlfriend. She wanted to leave and asked if I'd walk her home. This was unexpected, our original plan was for my buddies to crash at my place, thinking I was getting the hint I agreed. So I gave my house keys to my friends and said I'd catch up to them tomorrow.
So I walked my girlfriend home, through around -20C Canadian winter weather. She didn't have a proper coat so I gave her mine like a fucking gentleman. I bought us some Tim's hot chocolate along the way too, even though I was quite broke.
She wanted to stop and chat on the bridge, apparently not feeling the cold as much as I was. I was a trooper though and suffered through it. She wanted to hash out whether we were calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend yet. Minus 20 in the direct wind cutting through the river valley while half cut was the logical place to do this.
We got to her place at the university residence after an hour or so of walking, she kissed me, said good night and quickly walked through the front door, leaving me locked out (it was a key-card entry). She still had my coat.
I realized then that I had misread the situation. She never intended on inviting me in.
My phone battery was nearly dead so I turned it off in case I needed it. I was pretty poor at the time and taxis were expensive so I decided to walk home, which was back on the other side of town another five kilometres away.
Part of the river valley juts south a ways at one point, rather than go around to the bridge I decided to cut through the valley on the walking path at the bottom. I start down the path and hit a patch of ice and slid slowly all the way to the bottom on my back. I was still quite drunk so I just laid there a bit as I realized that I may not be able to get up the path on the other side in this state. Plus it's pitch black in the valley and nobody will find me down there for hours. I spent the next hour meandering up the far side of the valley and finishing the walk home (stopping to relocate a road construction sign to a different street. Priorities after all).
It's 5am when I get home and I don't have my key. I knock and yell but can't get my friends to wake up. I pull out my phone to call them and drop it on the step, smashing the screen (big otter case on it, got so cold that it snapped too). Finally after more knocking someone finally answers the door.
My buddy looks me up and down and bursts out laughing, ""I take it she didn't invite you inside? Where the fuck is your coat?"""

Officer told me that they were doing seatbelt enforcement and their spitter had seen me putting on my belt at a light 2 miles back. I looked him dead eye and told him his spotter was either wrong or lying I never drive without a buckle, he said well your not wearing it now, I told him you just watched me take it off to get my wallet for my ID and your body can if you were wearing as your supposed to would show you but my cell camera saw it all.

Halfway to my house, we get pulled over. It starts off as a typical traffic stop, but then they decide they want to screw with us or who knows.
His partner comes around to my side of the car and asks, ""Who are you?"" I ask, ""How's that relevant who is in the passenger seat for a traffic stop?"" This sets them off and now both of us get a barrage of questions. I did eventually give them my ID in hopes they'd just let us go, but nope. He sees my hometown (we're still in college so my ID address is where I grew up) and wants to know ""what part of town"" I live in.
I'm incredulous. Then he asks if he can search the car. I say, ""I'm not the driver or owner. Why you asking me?"" But then I turn to my friends and say, ""Don't consent.""
Now they're furious. ""What are you hiding? You two look like you're into drugs. What's that on the floor? Is that a gat?"" I didn't even know that slang. I'm ask, ""A What?"" Officer says, ""Gun.""

"  person lost interest due to partners constant need for attention, refusal to make positive changes, and incompatible views on lifestyle.","What made you suddenly lose interest in someone you were pursuing?

We met online and would talk for hours on a daily basis. After 2 years he needed a place to stay so I said he could come stay with me. It soon became clear when he arrived why I only ever saw headshots. He was morbidly obese, like 28 stone and disabled as a result. However, by that time, there were a lot of feelings involved, and I love people for who they are, not what they look like. So we made a go of it for two years.
In that time, I was working full time on the phones for a charity. When I came home, he wouldn't let me have a moment's peace and quiet, which is what I needed after a stressful day at work. Instead, he had to hold my hand constantly and would talk nonstop. I mean, I get he was on his own all day, but he would also be constantly messaging while I was at work, so I had no escape.
I literally became his full-time carer on top of working 45+ hours a week.I tried desperately to help him lose weight, but there was always an excuse. What pushed me over the edge was when we discussed that I wanted kids. However, he felt that my lifestyle was not healthy enough to possibly raise children. I was an average and totally acceptable weight.
In that moment, it became clear that he would never change. He had the nerve to criticise me when he had done nothing to improve himself, which filled me with rage. I told him it was over and he had 2 weeks to leave. He then told me he wanted to propose and that we should have kids right away. I noped right out of that relationship in an instant once he said that."
"  growing up in a neighborhood with lower-income families, the person noticed differences in home environments, family dynamics, and material possessions.","What's a non-obvious sign that someone is poor/low income?

I grew up in a poor neighborhood so I always believed I was poor but as I grew older I saw the differences in my home and my friends' households slowly realizing I wasn't poor at all. Also came to realize we lived there for convenience unlike many of my friends who could only afford that area. My father doesn't care for driving and strategically picked the neighborhood that was basically 5 minutes away from the best schools, 5 minutes from his job, 5 minutes from the grocery store, and somehow 5 minutes from our two nearby relatives. I still wonder how much he planned for that, and also ended up being able to save up thousands for his upcoming retirement.
There's a lot you start to see when you start paying attention. My friend's parent/s were never home, always working, the vast majority were latchkey kids, while my dad would go to work when we left for school and would be home shortly after school and my mother didn't work at all.
My friends would complain about missing dinner and would be excited for the free school lunch they got, which I never got. Me and my 3 siblings were getting $25 a week for school lunch from my dad. I never remember missing a meal. I lived the closest to the school so my friends would walk back with me and my mom would invite them all, maybe 4-5 kids, 2-3 times a week for an early dinner as she would ""accidently"" make way too much. None of them ever declined the offer.
They would rarely invite anyone to their home, the few times I would go their homes would be messy, roaches, no pets, one friend had a goldfish, no real games, toys or cable/internet usually. Again my mom was always home, the house was clean, we had a dog and some birds, we had a computer with internet and cable, we had a massive video game collection, i had a bunch of pokemon cards, we had bikes, skates, scooters etc. My house was always the house everyone wanted to hang out at.
My friends would have small birthday parties with 2/3 friends, I was almost always one, at their home, some takeout and a cake, we were the only ones inviting the whole class to chuckie cheese/Dave and buster's, they would all come parents as well, cousins of friends, people we've never met, my parents didn't seem to care, they'd just order more food.
We took vacations every year, amusement parks, beaches, and other countries. Most of my close friends didn't see a beach until spring break in high school when I had a car and my parents paid for my hotel and gas to go.
Their families usually had one car, not too old but older, usually a van of some type. My dad had a nice newer van, my mom a sedan and as my siblings got older they got some nice 2/3 year old sedans in high school, as did I. All my friends took the bus or asked us for rides. 
Looking back I felt close to them but I wonder if they liked me for me or from what they got from me. "
"  exploited worker exposes boss's wrongdoing, files claims for unpaid wages, tax evasion, and permit violations, leading to company closure.","Boss wouldn’t pay me the money I earned, so I had his company shut down 

Last year I started working for a local plumbing company that seemed promising. Would pay top dollar to employees for good old fashioned labor. So I signed my W-2 and went on my way. Seems legit, right?
I started out making an hourly wage, was given my own work van and was offered a work cell phone. However, if you used your personal cell phone, the owner of the company would pay your bill because you're using your own phone! How neat is that?
Fast forward a month or two. I was forced to make commission based off of every job and I didn't have a say in this. But 20% of every job you go to? Hell, that's a lot of money in plumbing! So I was none the wiser. Eventually I found out that my paychecks weren't having any taxes taken out of them. So I asked my boss
""Why am I not having taxes taken out of my check?""
To which he replied: ""When we switched you to commission, you're a subcontractor now. You're 1099! You're gonna be making so much bank now, bro.""
Didn't sign a 1099 form but ok.
As the time went on, I started working 90 hour weeks with no break. If my phone was turned off and the office folk tried to reach me and couldn't, they would take money out of my paycheck. The phone bill? Never got paid. There would be days where I wouldn't make a single dime because the boss would mess something up in our system. We also had no heat in our vans and when it got to -14° outside his words to us were ""Go buy a f’in blanket. I can't afford repairs like this right now"" while he is in Florida on a cruise with his whole family. So like anyone else, I just got up and quit. F that.
When I left, I asked for my checks (I was owed 3 of them for the weeks I worked) but my boss wasn't ready to give them up yet.
""You f’ed me over, and now I'm going to f you over."" He said when I asked why he wasn't going to pay me. I offered multiple times for him to just meet me so this wouldn't have to go any further. He refused.
I took to r/legaladvice (bless them) and asked what I should do. The responses led me to LARA (Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs) to file a wage claim to get my money. But on top of that, I filed a report with them stating the company doesn't pull permits (which is required to do) when replacing people's plumbing. So they sent over an investigator to check these claims out.
I then went to the IRS to find out about this whole tax ordeal. I filed the proper paperwork to have the IRS check and see if I was misclassified as a 1099 employee when I should have been a W-2 employee since they weren't taking taxes out. SURE AS SHIT I was wrongfully not getting taxes taken out of my checks. So the IRS sent an investigator of their own.
Now at this point I see on my phone that I still have their email address linked to my Google account. So I do some snooping. It turns out they haven't paid city taxes in over 6 years and that the office manager (a woman who has verbally abused me time and time again) collects disability through the state but still collects a 1.5k paycheck from the company every week. You can bet ass I sent that in with the IRS. Screenshots included in my email.
This is how it all unfolded.
I have a friend that still works (or rather worked for them at the time) and he told me about the investigators coming in. LARA fined them upwards of $50,000 for failing to produce the proper permits for work that was performed. They also paid me what the company owed me WITH INTEREST since I waited over a month for those checks. On top of all of this, the IRS made them pay for my taxes at the end of the year, took away the office manager's disability, audited them because they haven't paid city taxes and fined them for each employee they did this to. At this time as well, all of his fleet vans broke due to wear and tear. This resulted in the company closing.
When he asked me why I did all of this my response was simply:
""You f’ed me over, so I fed you over.""

Mine is in a few months but the awkwardness has already started.
First, I never had any plans to go. Things like that really aren't my speed. I'm not a mingler and I always want to leave right away. Besides I'll be away on military orders by that time anyway so there's no way I can go.
So a few weeks ago I get added to a (my school) 10 hear reunion page on FB by someone I don't recognize. Immediately think ""nope"" and leave the page, then don't think about it again. I got a phone call a few days later from an unknown number. Not unusual since lots of people call me for work stuff. I answer and get this really enthusiastic ""OMG HI IT'S (NAME) HOW ARE YOU!""
I apologize and tell her I think she has the work number. I don't know anyone with that name. She says my whole name and says she got my number from (friend from school). She was the class president but I honest to god didnt remember ber. She asks about the reunion, I politely tell her I'm not going, I have other obligations. She says ""I don't know if that will work, I'll be in touch"" and hangs up. I'm like wtf but whatever.
A few days later I get added back to the same group by her. Again I leave it. Not 30 minutes later I get a phone call from her. She wants to know why I left the group again, and again I tell her I have other obligations. She told me that ""you don't skip reunions, we've planned this for years. You'll be there."" So sarcastically I said ""ok well save me a spot then"" and up.
A third time I'm added to this group. I'm like ffs and leave again. I get a call and this time she's calling to tell me that my ticket and dinner money are due by the end of the week. I politely remind her that I'm not going. She gets snooty and informs me that the venue and catering have already been reserved and that I will need to pay for my meal as the fund would not cover it.
Once again I remind her that I was never attending and that it isn't my fault that she paid in advance without a proper count. She then told me ""you don't have choice, it's already paid for so you have to be there. I said ""alright bye (wrong name) and hung up again.
I ended up blocking her on FB, ignoring her calls, and leaving the group 2 more times when other members of the reunion committee added me back in."

"  student and partner drove for over an hour with sleeping instructor, following rules until instructor woke up, leading to unsafe driving.","Driver’s license testers, what’s the worst thing a kid has done without batting an eye while taking the driving test?

I was the kid, and it was on a learning drive not the test..
We had to do 6 schedule drives with our instructor, and had a partner. One would drive for 30 minutes, then you would stop and switch so the other could drive back. The rule when you got in the car, just so it wasn’t a constant game of “should I turn?” was that you always go straight until the instructor tells you to turn.
So one Saturday, we had a very early drive scheduled. We met up at the school, and I was the first to drive. We got about 5 minutes in, turned onto a main road, and the instructor quickly fell asleep. My partner and I quietly (with a smirk) agreed that we would still follow the rules.
We took the road for about an hour and fifteen minutes, until it dead-ended and you had to turn. I pulled over in a parking lot, and we woke up the instructor to ask him which way to turn. It took a good 30 seconds for him to realize what had happened and where we were. He yelled at us both to get in the back seat, and we witnessed some very unsafe ways to drive as we headed back towards the school.
And I didn’t bat an eye."
"  friend's wedding nearly took place despite toxic groom's behavior, but was called off after incriminating video was revealed during ceremony.","People who have been to a wedding where someone objected to the marriage, what was their reason?

This happened a couple of years ago. A work/social friend of mine was getting married to a guy she had previously dated, but broke off the relationship 'cause one night he was drunk and tried to strangle her. They were apart for a couple of years (he supposedly cleaned up) and then started dating again. One night, we three were at a bar, and my friend has to go to the restroom. As soon as she leaves the table, he nudges my elbow and tells me how loose her pussy is, and that it's wrecked and shit (I'm a guy). I told him, ""She loves you man. Don't talk about my friend like that. It's disrespectful, and it'll end with me kicking your ass."" He tells me, ""F you."" My friend comes back to the table and realizes there's enough tension to cut with a knife. I gave my friend a kiss on the cheek and called it a night. She called me later that evening and asked what happened, I gave it to her straight. I could hear her crying on the other end.
She kept on dating this toxic piece of shit. A few months later, the wedding announcements were sent. I was just like, ""Oh f.""
One night, I'm out on a date (who becomes my future wife) at a nice Italian restaurant, when I see Mr. Toxic sitting at the bar, kissing the neck of some woman who isn't my friend (this was about a week and a half before the wedding). I whip out the phone and start filming. I got a good shot of him grabbing this lady's breast and putting his hand up her skirt, with her slapping his hand off. My future wife is like, ""WTF are you doing?"" I quietly explain the situation. After I got enough evidence, he see's me, comes over to the table and asks me what I'm doing there. I tell him that I'm doing what people do when they go to a restaurant. He asked me how long I was there, I said that we were just seated. He's like ""OK, well I was just getting a drink and am on my way home."" I told him to drive safely. He walks out, the woman at the bar gets this confused look on her face and then runs after him.
After a life changing fabulous date (besides the previous shit), I go over to my friends' house. Mr. Toxic's car isn't there. I show my friend the video, tell her that I shot it hours ago and she breaks down into a crying mess. I ask the question, ""You're not going to go through with the wedding are you?"" She tells me that all the reservations have been made, the church booked, the caterers paid, the photographer paid....yadda yadda. I'm like, who gives a shit? No one wanted to see her married to a cheater. She says she doesn't want to marry him, but she's obligated. I'm good friends with her father. He's a hulking 6'4"" 300lb. Harley rider with a handlebar mustache. I pay him a visit. I show him the video. He turns red. Veins start showing up on his forehead. His hands start opening and closing in clenches. He says, ""Motherf’er!"" I explain to him what how his daughter feels obligated. He gives me a bear hug that just about breaks my back. He lets me go, I see he's crying profusely. He asks me if I could send him the video. I'm like, ""Of course.""
The next day my friend's dad calls me up and tells me that the wedding is going to now be a 'Dodging A Bullet' ceremony with maybe an ass kicking for the finale'. I told him that I would be more than happy to attend. My friend called me up and thanked me. She said that her dad dropped by and told her that he would not allow her to marry him. It was a load off her back.
So we went over Mr. Toxic's guest list. No family, just friends....PERFECT.
The day of the ceremony, Dad had a large flat screen T.V. plugged in on the dais. The preacher was warned I guess, cause Dad walked his daughter down the aisle, and when they got to the end, the preacher turned around and walked out. Mr. Toxic didn't notice but he reached out for my friends' hand and her dad loudly said, ""No f’ing way in this Universe!"" Then the flat screen with surround sound came on. There it was for everyone to see, with my future wife saying, ""WTF are you doing?"", and my whole explanation afterwards. Mr. Toxic was pasty white and sweating profusely. He did the perp walk down the center aisle, caught my eye with me giving him the finger too. I heard a dude say, ""No f’ing way!"" Mr. Toxic exits and dad says, ""Let's Party!""
That was it. We had a great night. There were a couple times that my friend broke down crying, but overall she danced her ass off and laughed a lot. About 6 months later, she met the man of her dreams. Just a really fantastic guy. The wedding is this September."
"  a massage gone wrong: brutal beating by elderly therapist, followed by an awkward encounter involving an aroused client and painful mishap.","Massage therapists, what are some of your most awkward or disgusting experiences with patients?

While in a deployed location, there was an opportunity to get massages from the local nationals. Now, we had heard horror stories of these ""massage therapists"", basically, just old ladies that beat you up. But, my buddy was having back problems and said screw it, I'm going to try.
So, he goes in for the massage note these women do not speak english, takes his clothes off, wraps the towel around him and climbs up on the table. This masseuse proceeds to literally then punch the ever living shit out of him (his back, back of his legs, and neck). PUNCH Not massage, she just beats him up.
He said he was not prepared for the beating of his life. First off, the lady was like 130 lbs, looked like she was 80 yrs old, had arthritic, gnarled hands and he swore she could've knocked out Chuck Liddel in his prime she hit so damn hard.
Eventually, he kinda got used to it or his penis decided it felt good because he got aroused. Now, we've been without our SOs for about 4 months at this time, so it's kind of understandable. Anyways, the old lady nudges him to roll over, and he complies.
As he rolls over, towel gets caught, and BOOM rock hard penis is staring at this old ladies face. So, the worst thing he could possibly do ... he does. He shrugs his shoulders, slyly smiles, and winks at her.
We're all sitting around smoking and bullshitting when we see him running to the tent like quasi moto attempting to put his clothes on, clutching his junk ... literally wailing like an infant. We run into the tent to find out what happens and inbetween sobs, he explains what happens after the wink.
""She ... she is unnaturally fast. I don't even think I fully completed the wink before she had one hand on my dick and one on my balls. She squeezed my balls harder than a trash compactor, yanked on my dick ..."" This is where he starts crying again ... just replaying the memory.
Of course, we're dying laughing. Then he says ... ""But, it didn't stop there ..""
No More Laughing
In the post pathetic voice I've ever heard a grown man use ""... then she 1, 2 combo'd my shaft.""
Needless to say, he was pretty sure his dick was broken, and could not jerk-off for a good month, it just hurt too much. I still talk to him to this day, and he swears to never get a massage again."
"  last-minute voicemail reveals ex-boyfriend's abusive threats, turning the case in favor of the client and securing a decisive victory.




","Lawyers, what was your “HOLD IT!” moment where you knew you would win?

I was representing a mom in her petition for a restraining order against boyfriend and dad.
At issue in the broader case was child visitation, custody, support etc. but today's hearing was just on the restraining order. We had pretty good facts but it was mostly based on testimony of the parties. My client was way more reputable as a witness so I was feeling confident.
10 minutes before the hearing, my client shows up. I give her a last minute prep on what to expect and then she says ""I'm glad I'm going through with this. I can't deal with it any more and he's just getting worse. To top it off, he left me a drunken, ranting voicemail on Saturday.""
""You have your phone with you?""
""Yes.""
We play the voicemail and it's a full two minutes of ex-boyfriend screaming shit like ""I should have f’ing killed you when we were together."" ""You were always such a bitch."" ""I hope you burn to death in a fire.""
I didn't have time to ask her why the f she hadn't said anything to me about the voicemail before the bailiff called our case. We sit, the judge asks if either side has additional evidence, and I ask for permission to play the voicemail. Ex boyfriend, who didn't have an attorney, didn't object, so I played the whole nasty two minute rant in open court.
Judge goes ""We're going to take a brief recess before I issue my ruling. If the parties want to meet and confer in the hall, they are welcome to.""
Boyfriend knew he was f’ed. We settled the whole damn case then and there. My client got her wish list in terms of custody, supervised visitation, child support, plus the restraining order, to boot."
"  a misunderstanding of opposite sex: Believed emotional boys turned into girls, feared castration, and misinterpreted lack of underwear as castration aftermath.","What was something you didn’t realize for years members of the opposite sex do?

I thought girls came from emotional boys. When I was young, my parents threatened me with castration whenever I acted emotionally.
They would say something along the lines of “If you don’t stop crying then we’ll cut your balls off and turn you into a girl. Do you want that!""
Harsh, but it was very effective. I would always stop crying after that because I did not want to lose my balls even though at the time I could not come up with reasons why I even had balls. All I knew was that I did not want to get my balls cut off. At that time I started to realize that girls probably came from boys who were too emotional. There were moments when I really wanted to ask a girl how she lost her balls, but I was too afraid to ask and I did not want to have her relive that awful experience. Part of me also did not want to hear the painful feeling of having your balls cut off too. I actually did believe this for a while. Especially when at that time I heard rumors of circumcision. I thought both were somehow related.
Eventually, I would be scarred for a year when I was sort of hanging out with a girl around my age and I notice that she wasn't wearing any underwear. I panicked and ran off. For the longest time, I thought I saw the aftermath of castration and all that was left on her lower body was the remnants of what was a penis and testicles. I could not go to sleep for a while because of the horrible nightmares I would get sometimes."
"  a friend confesses indifference towards the person's life, causing heartbreak and leading to a downward spiral of self-destructive behavior.","When has a friend of yours said something that straight up ended the friendship? 

A guy I considered my friend and crush once told me he wouldn't care if I died. Needless to say, I was heartbroken. 
We were both 15. N was a band geek, obsessed with the girls in color guard and the one girl in his band group.(N is the guy, short for nice guy),  While I was more of a shy nice girl who mostly got her feelings out with punk music, N was very extroverted, saying he loved being ""constantly surrounded by beautiful women of the color guard who love me"" and often gave girls (including me for a time) unsolicited, very tight hugs all the time. He was no catch, but I was looking at the world through rose-colored glasses. All of our mutual friends knew that I liked him by this point, and they had all encouraged me to just go for it already.
I had come out to N about liking him the day before, and I'd had this overwhelming crush on him for over a year by then. I was devastated by this. I had our first date built up in my head and a consuming idea of what a happy couple we would be like together. He gave me an honest answer, and I can respect that now, but I didn't want to take no for an answer back when I was a moronic 15-year-old.
It was at the beginning of lunch, and no one else had sat down at our friend table yet. I sat down in my usual seat next to N, and he started talking to me like nothing had happened the day prior. I refused to act like nothing had happened and confronted him. I pretty much went off on him about how I would be great for him (very nice girl) and said something along the lines of, ""I can't keep living like this, being just your friend.""
He replied, ""Then don't live. I don't care.""
My face went red, and I ran into the bathroom to cry. I thought I loved him in my 15-year-old head because he could make me feel normal. When he told me that, I took it as him telling me to kill myself and began a downward spiral where I actually wanted to for years.
N and someone I thought was my friend began to bully me after that, saying I was not welcome and that I was a loser. I heard through the grapevine that he called me a ""crazy bitch stalker girl"" at one point. We were all in the same Honors classes (of which there was only one of each--small school), so there was nothing I could do about it unless I wanted to completely change the trajectory of my school life and drop honors.
Here's where the story takes a major twist. N's mom was friends with the school's only guidance counselor, who was in charge of making class schedules and taking charge with ""problem children"" who were at risk with drugs or violence. One day I was walking quickly (behind N apparently) so I could put my stuff down in class and go to the bathroom like I always did at this time of day. Guidance counselor called my dad without me knowing and called him to the office for a meeting with the entire school's administration staff. My dad took off work and went to the school, thinking that my newfound reclusive behavior may have been a sign that I was getting into drugs and the school was worried.
Instead, my dad went through what he described to me as a circular conversation with the guidance counselor and the rest of the administration. He was instructed not to tell me this, but he did anyway. The people told my father that he had to ""shut me up"" and ""make me leave N alone."" They said that I was causing trouble for one of their brighter and more popular students, and that they had school cam footage they would present to the police of me stalking him through the halls if they had to.
Since that infamous ""I don't care"" day, I have been hospitalized three times for attempting to end myself. I had gone off the deep end, almost hurting N during a horrible panic attack. I had cried openly in front of people I barely knew in school. N and one of our mutual friends started bullying me, and I eventually had to move towns and change schools because it wasn't going to stop. I have one friend that I still talk to from that school; the others I tried to talk to afterward but it didn't really work out.
I have since gone through an underage drinking phase and a hoe phase, both of which I have gotten over entirely. I will probably be on anti-anxiety medication for the rest of my life, but I have since found religion and made peace with myself over what happened. I have forgiven N, and I think the final part of that was writing out the main details and posting. So thank you."
"  college student trades sexual favor for math homework help, only to discover the class was passing regardless.","What’s the dumbest/smallest thing you’ve traded for sexual favors to obtain?

In college I took an “alternative math” class to fill my math portion of my major. The math course was in resource economics. The classroom we had it in had round tables like in a cafeteria and we were all placed in groups we’d work with for the end of the year. The teacher emphasized we needed to learn Excel to the highest degree. I was by far the youngest as a freshman in a 300 level class. Absolutely nobody understood what the class was about or what we were doing. I retained near to nothing. Well, the pass/fail deadline had already gone and went and I was doing quite terribly. Everything culminated to the final and the homework wasn’t due until the end of the semester. Naturally, I was pissed.
I kind of accepted my demise as the semester wore down swearing I’d take calculus instead next time when I failed. I was also single and trying to mingle. On tinder I swiped this kid who’s major was “resource economics” in his bio. I was astounded. No one was that major. I messaged him flirtatiously saying I was taking a Res Econ course and needed help on my homework. We ended up setting a hangout time so he could help me. I went to his dorm and pulled out my laptop while he did my homework and didn’t even attempt to explain it to me. Halfway through he said, “blowjob for me finishing the rest of your homework?” I shrugged and said sure. I wasn’t super attracted to him but anything for free homework. I ended up giving him a 2 minute blowjob and left his room with 100% on my homework.
Worst part was when we all went to take the final the teacher announced before the test he understood how much this class sucked. He said we’d all be passing the class no matter how much work we did and getting at least a 60 on the final. Passed the class either way. I regret nothing."
"  how students in 2002 were angry and rebellious, in 2012 they were mopey, and in 2022 they are socially conscious and competitive.","Teachers, what’s the difference between 2002, 2012 and 2022 students?

Everybody is going tech so I'll go with cultural. All teens rebel. They all think they have it right and the grownups have it wrong... but they show it differently. In 97 the prevailing word was Anger HATE the way things are."" Kids were harsher. Meaner. Being nasty was the way to show you're cool, I saw a lot of kids get their kicks out of breaking the Santa illusion for grade schoolers for example. 17 kids are much nicer to each other. Think of the music of the time, Smashing Pumpkins, NIN, and the like.
""In spite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage""
In 07 the word was Mope. Kids were softening up, being nicer to eachother, but also getting more into the ""Sadness is beautiful"" kind of thing. They weren't angry at the adults so much as they just wanted them to go away and hide into their hoodies. ""Leave me alone to my solitude.""
Consider the
way Emo was huge at this time.
In 17 kids are MUCH nicer to each other. They're kind to young kids and friendlier in general.., but there's this strange undercurrent of competition to be ""The Most Good Person"" which leads to the weird ""Yes Mayonnaise is a gender if that's how you identify"" kind of thing. In '17 kids want to explain to the grownups how they're all bigots. They also handle failure FAR worse than previous generations. ""17 kids try harder and genuinely want to succeed in ways that the '97 kids didn't. In 197 you were cool if you avoided working hard and didn't care if you failed... but '97 kids also recovered from adversity faster. They didn't bruise as easily. They were harder, meaner kids, but also didn't quit as easily and thrived on constructive criticism. Now there's bits of each of these personality types in every year. There were nice kids who were also soft in 97, and there are mopey emo types now... but the prevailing culture shifted these ways."
"  student exploited a loophole by repeatedly taking classes with lenient professor, checking all possible answers for high grades and impressive resume.","What was a loophole that you found and exploited the hell out of?

What was a loophole that you found and exploited the hell out of? Going anonymous here so I don’t lose my degree! I’m currently in college at a large university in the US. My minor has simple requirements: pass at least 4 of 10 offered classes. As it turns out, 4 of the 10 classes are taught by the same professor. He teaches 2 in the fall and 2 in the spring. By chance, I took him once. I’ve taken him 3 more times and have earned my minor, getting A’s in every single class. And I guarantee you I couldn’t pass a basic class with any other professor. This professor gives weekly quizzes and monthly tests in person, but via the computer. We sign into a special software that doesn’t allow us to search the internet, and take the test with him there. Everything was multiple choice. But here’s where it gets interesting: Many of his questions had more than one answer. So, he set the test so you could check as many answers as you want e.g. we could select both A and B because the answer could be both. But the test never counted how many answers we selected, and it only made sure you checked the right box, not if you checked a wrong box too. So if the answer was A and B, and I checked A,B, and C, it would count as right. So what’d I do? I checked A,B,C,D, and E for almost every single question. The software would see that I checked the right answer (because I checked every answer) and mark the question right. Sometimes, to maintain realism, I’d purposefully check only one box for a few questions to get them wrong. My average scores stood between 95–100% the entire semester. And quizzes and tests made up 75% of his grading, the other 25% being just menial homework. These classes boosted my GPA noticeably, and now I have a particularly impressive minor to put on my resume."

If I’m dead, I’m not around so it doesn’t matter to me after the fact. And it doesn’t do you any good either, since I’m not there. Plus, you’ll probably get caught and go to jail. Meh. Surprised, he was. Shocked. Not what he expected. Two weeks later, he came back and threatened to kill my parents. Well, now that one was tough. I wouldn’t be able to live with the guilt of knowing I caused their deaths. What could I do? I went back to being his girlfiend to save my parents. After a few months, he still wasn’t bored of me. I brought him over to my parents house to meet them, figuring they’d be obnoxious like they usually are. I say “obnoxious like they usually are” since at that time I was a teenager and at that age we all think our parents are mean. I thought he’d finally get bored, realize being with me was going to be as horrible as I thought being with him was, and leave of his own free will. No such luck. For two whole weeks, my parents were super nice, kind, and freindly to this freaking abomination. Suprised, I was. Shocked. Not what I expected. So I sat down with my mother whilst the nasty peice of work was out of earshot and told her that the only reason we were together is that he had threatened to kill you guys if I dumped him. Within 24 hours of that conversation, my father took him for a drive to a bus station and paid for a bus to Montana. I have no idea what my father said to him on that drive, but my family and I never heard from that creep again."
"  abuse victims occasionally fight back physically, as in one case where a teen blocked his mother's slap, leading to ongoing conflict.","For those of you who grew up with abusive parents, did you ever hit them back?

For those of you who grew up with abusive parents, did you ever hit them back? As a teen I came home from school one day and went to my room to change and start my homework. I had reports to do and tests to study for. I was home for less than 15 minutes when I heard my mom screaming for me to get my ass into the kitchen. She had thrown a luncheon for several of the Officer’s wives (using the good china of course) and wanted me to clean the mess up so she could “fix” dinner. Mind you I hadn’t been home since 6:30 that morning and it was around 4 pm now (after I walked over a mile home . . cause she never picked me up and I was 1/4 mile short of riding the bus). So the dishes stacked on the kitchen table, in the sink and over all the counters had sat for several hours as had the mess she made preparing the luncheon. I walked into the kitchen and immediately got the sharp pointed finger poking me in the chest as she screeched at me about ignoring the mess to “hang out in my room” neglecting MY responsibilities. I tried to explain about the reports and tests . . NOPE! What did I expect that she would do the dishes herself? I did answer her and she didn’t like that at all. I had suggested that maybe she should have cleaned up the cooking mess as she worked (or loaded the dishwasher) and maybe used disposable dishes instead of the fine hand wash only china. Well, my homework and studying could wait . . it always had to wait until whatever she wanted done got done. I ought to be thankful I had a roof over my head and food to eat. . . Then she hauled back her hand to slap my face. Not unusual but as I was hot, tired and really needing to do my homework I was fed up! So, for once I blocked the slap. I simply knocked the hand aside. That made her even angrier! Now instead of slapping me she came at me with the claws scraping my face and tearing at my eyes. I took one of her arms by the wrist and twisted the arm away from my face and she started yelling about me assaulting her! When the other came toward me in a fist I grabbed her fist and started to squeeze as hard as I could. Then I sort of wriggled the fist so I could feel the bones . . something my older brothers had told me about . I didn’t break her but it hurt her. She jerked back and got a slap in and I slapped her back right as my dad came home from work. She of course put on the water works about how I had attacked her when all she had done was ask me to “help”. Dad looked at me and my bloody face from her sharp nails and told mom to go to the other room while he spoke to me. I explained to him about my homework, the short deadlines for the reports, the tests that got sprung on me and how I came home to Mom having thrown a party and left the entire mess for me. Dad took me out for some fast food . . Cause Mom was yelling from the other room she was never going to feed me again. Then he told me to go to my room for the rest of the night. Mom wasn’t happy when she smelled the fast food on me . . we had eaten in the car. Nor was she happy when she figured I wasn’t cleaning the kitchen before being sent to my room. She then decided that she would leave everything for me to do in the morning BEFORE I walked to school . . Dad told her NO. If she did he would tell all the other officers to tell their wives to never accept an invite from her AND TO STOP INVITING HER TO THEIR GATHERINGS TOO! She wanted to know just WHO was going to clean up . . he told her it was her mess “deal with it yourself”. I’d like to say my mom never tried to hit me again. Shoot I was an adult with my own kids the last time she tried. But, that was the last time she made contact because every other time I would grab her wrist and ask her if she wanted to be treated the same way because I wasn’t going to stand and take it any longer. Then when I reached adult age I would leave the house . . . at one point it was over 3 years that she didn’t see me or my children all because I would not tolerate her abuse to me or potentially to them."
"  man refused an inheritance, giving it to his youngest sister who cared for their mother, prioritizing family over money.","Have you ever refused an inheritance?

Have you ever refused an inheritance? Why? Yes. My mother left everything to me and my sister. As oldest son, she named me executor. Most of her estate was her house and its furnishings. My youngest sister had been living with her and took care of her during her final days. However, she had borrowed lots of money from mom over the years, and the will specified that in lieu of a part of the property, all her debts were forgiven. We could have sold the house and divided the proceeds. My youngest sister would have been left out and would have to find a new home with no money to work with. Her worthless ex-husband had (years earlier) borrowed against their own home to pay past due business taxes. My sister was repaying that mortgage alone because he was useless. bottom line, she would not be able to buy another home. I told my other sister I would give my share to the younger since she had been taking care of mom, and I could never let her become homeless. Fortunately my older sister agreed and since neither of us needed the house or the money from a sale, we gave the house to my youngest sister to live in until either she dies or decides she wants to sell it. All she has to do is upkeep, keep it insured and pay the property taxes. I haven't missed a dime of that inheritance, and I sleep well at night knowing I put family over money."
"  in a dangerous situation, a codeword system saves a person from assault by pretending to call their mom and alerting authorities.","Have you ever had to lie to save your life? 

“If I don’t call my mom right now, she’ll call the cops.” Some background: My mother devised a system of codewords and numbers that if used in certain ways meant different things. My older brothers would sometimes party with their friends in some not-so-great areas, so there were things that could be texted or said over the phone that saved them from bad situations. Maybe a rival gang showed up, the cops showed up, or there were unknown substances on the scene (hey, we’ve all smoked a little zaza). The words were: breakfast sausages, kitty litter, tampons/pads/period (any could be used), ice cream, garbage, recycling The numbers were 1–10. ”Breakfast sausages at 10?” Meant “Something is happening here and I feel unsafe”. My mom would question “Does that work” for “do you need me to come get you”. Yes meant she came, No meant she alerted the cops who would usually just drive by. So, how did this help me? I was at a party where a guy was very insistent on getting me alone, and much bigger than I was. Upon getting me into a bedroom alone, he proceeded to push me down on the bed, and get on top of me. Over the noise of the party, screaming wasn’t working so I struggled, kicking and wiggling. When he grabbed my hair and yanked me up, I caught an old school alarm clock familiar red numbers and then started “freaking out”. ”Oh my god it’s so late I’m going to be effing killed!” He stopped for a second, confused, and I said “I need to call my mom right now or she’ll call the cops! I was supposed to be home an hour ago!” Immediately he was off of me and my phone was in my hand. No one wants cops at a party. My exchange with my mom went a little something like this: ”Hey mom, super sorry that it’s so late.

I’ll make sure I’m dropped off early so it’s done before the garbage is collected. Can you grab me some tampons at the store tomorrow?” (My would-be assailant is looking rather uncomfortable) ”I’ll throw on a robe and be there in 5. Be ready for me to scream.” My mom proceeded to yell some rather nonsensical things at me over the phone, as I’d requested with “tampons”. “Garbage” was that whoever I was concerned about was near me, potentially being able to hear the phone conversation or read texts. “Kitty litter” meant I needed to leave ASAP, “9” meaning without cops. My would-be assaillant was very uncomfortable and I left the room without a word, my mom yelling on the phone, and an overly exaggerated wince on my face. I reconnected with my friend and told her what happened, she walked me out with her boyfriend and ended up telling me that same guy had told her he thought we’d “really connected” and wanted my info. In the end, I lied. But I would’ve been assaulted if I hadn’t. It’s a system I’m glad to pass on to my daughter!"
"  a witness at a playground sees a stepmother cruelly rejecting her stepson, prompting the witness to offer kindness and support.","As a parent, what's the saddest scene you have ever witnessed?

A woman at the playground telling her young toddler stepson (no older than my daughter), “I’m not going to play with you, you’re not MY kid” while I stood right nearby. When the boy got upset and teary, she laughed at him. At first, I thought she was just some rude bystander being terrible to some child she did not know, but he kept trying to get her attention and get her to interact with him, and she was meaner each time. It became apparent she was married to or in some way romantically involved with the boy’s father. I ended up asking him if he wanted to play with my daughter, and spent about an hour encouraging them to play together. The stepmom wandered off at some point and sat under an awning at a table on her phone, ignoring us entirely. I thought several times, I could just walk away with this little boy, and that woman would not even notice me doing it. I wondered a couple of times if she’d even call the cops. It’s the only time in my life I’ve had any impulse like that. I just tried to show him an adult who genuinely wanted to interact with him, but I’ve never wanted to just run away with a child more in my life. Eventually, his father showed up, and the stepmom was suddenly sickly-sweet and talking to him about “this nice lady’s daughter wanted to play; I just didn’t want to be in the way, just let me finish my conversation and I’ll come play with you again,” blah blah blah. The dad came over and talked with us, said thank you for playing with him. The stepmom was headed our way and I just gave the little boy a hug and said to his father, “I don’t care what she is to you, your son should come first, and I’d leave anyone who spoke to my kid the way she does,” scooped my daughter up, and left. I haven’t seen them at that playground again, but that doesn’t mean anything. I hope he dumped her and found someone worth being in that little boy’s life."
"  shamed for a fishy odor condition, doctors ignored concerns. Research revealed Trimethylaminuria, but medical care remained unhelpful and shaming.","Have you been so ashamed of a medical condition they had that they decided to ignore it/not see a doctor?

Well… here's my story.. When I was around 21 it started. If I ate fish, I would smell of fish from my vajay jay. It doesn't wash away. It fades slightly and comes right back and lasts a few days. Now I quickly figured out there was a direct link. You could even smell what fish I had. I had comments from friends and family things like “oh have you had lemon sole for lunch? I absolutely love that one from lidl""… yes I did… 2 days ago…” it's quite an embarrassing situation! Nobody wants a “fishy fanny"". So I stopped eating fish At a doctor's appointment I was asked about my diet. How often do I drink? Smoke? How many portions of fruit and veg daily? Eggs? Meat and fish? So I tell her why I don't eat fish. She looked at me like I was completely crazy. “you have bacterial vaginosis, nothing to do with eating fish"" “But it only happens when I eat fish, and you can smell exactly which fish I ate…” She looked even more like she was talking to a lunatic. “Riiight… come in again when it happens and we will swab you"" So I went home, ate fish, rebooked on an appointment. I was swabbed. “There is quite an odour, it's definitely BV, but a swab will confirm it for you"". The results were negative. It was ignored that it was negative. Never spoken about again. I'd vaguely mentioned it to a few other doctor over the years. The same “you're a crazy"" look came from their faces. But no further action. Then I got pregnant with my eldest at 29 and I had to see a dietician as I had gestational diabetes. Again questions about my diet. “Fruit and veg? Meat? Fish?” “I avoid fish, it makes my vaginal fluids smell of fish…” “That isn't a thing, I need you to eat a minimum of 2 portions of fish a week for your baby's brain development"". With lots of medical professionals sticking their heads and hands up and around my hoohah I didn't want to smell of fish from several meters away so I declined and ate more eggs instead. But I did go home and research it. After some research I discovered I wasn't alone. There is an entire forum of us. Mainly women, but there are men who get it too, the smell coming from sweaty areas. Doctors also either ignored them, diagnosed bacterial vaginosis or STIs if they did listen or like me were given a look like they were insane. After digging through hundreds of comments I had an answer. Trimethylaminuria (TMAU) aka fish odour syndrome. Many people actually smell like garbage with it. It's caused by not being able to process some proteins. So it releases them in sweat and other fluids. There is no current cure. But the group had managed to discover through their own experiments that drinking strong lemon drinks. Real lemons, not an artificial flavouring, taking cranberry tablets 30–60 mins before eating fish, or whilst youre on antibiotics. Obviously it's not advised to live on antibiotics though so you can eat fish. But I finally had answers. It had a name. People understood. And doctors had been no help at all. They made medical care unapproachable. Felt shame for even mentioning it."
"  a stepmom hid snacks for her own kids, leaving the protagonist and their sibling excluded. The memory still hurts deeply.




","What happened to you as a child that feels like a punch to the gut every time you think about it?

I was 4 yrs old when my dad married my step mom, who had 3 kids of her own. One night me and my sister was woken up by my dad who told us to come into the kitchen. We could instantly tell by his tone that he was mad about something, and I wondered what I had done this time to make him mad at me. The kitchen was a wreck, all the cabinets were open and stuff was thrown everywhere. On the table was a pile of bags of cookies, snack cakes, candy bars, and all sorts of goodies. My dad pointed to the table and said “Go ahead! Eat what you want! Eat all of it if want to!” My stepmom, stepbrother, and stepsisters were all standing in the kitchen not saying a word. My sister and I nervously walked up to the table, took something and began cautiously eating our treats. The snack cake I was eating was one I had never had before. I reached up to the table and got another and said “These are really good, you want one?” and offered it one of my stepsisters. A look of fear crossed my stepmom and step siblings face as my dad snatched it out of my hand and threw it back on the table. “No! I said YOU eat it!” my dad yelled. My sister who is older than me asked “What’s going on?” My stepmom yelled “Just eat the damn cake!” and my dad shot my stepmom a look that made everyone else not say a single word until me and my sister finished our snack cakes. “You want another one? Go ahead eat everything on the whole table if you want to!” My dad said. My sister and I feeling really nervous having everyone watch us eat said we weren’t hungry and went back to bed. We never spoke of that night again. It took several years before I realized what had happened that night. My stepmom, whose kids were much older than me and my sister, had been hiding the snacks and giving them to her kids after she sent us to bed and my dad caught her. After that night there always seemed to be snacks in the house. I know a parent loves their own kids more than stepchildren, but to purposely exclude me and my sister like that just showed me how little she cared for us."

","I am going to hell for this and I do not care 

Back when I was growing up I always seemed to float between two worlds. In school, I would be considered to be a quiet nerd that was left alone. At home hung out with a pretty rough crowd and was always getting into trouble. Between the drinking, the fighting, the substances, and other dumb shit I always tried to keep those 2 worlds separate. I got bused to a different school due to being Special Ed so keeping the 2 separate was pretty easy for the most part. There were at times some bleed over, at times ( I was in woodshop class and the style at the time was to have the velcro straps hanging off the back of my hi-tops and another student grabbed them causing me to fall. He ended up in the hospital for catching a claw hammer in the face. Between having to deal with the psychological counseling and the trial I decided to avoid this kind of petty crap in the future. I sent the message and it was heard loud and clear.). I pretty much had the reputation of don't eff with him, when he snaps he is dangerous. As I cleaned up my drinking and drug use I figured I would leave the violence as well. Not that I was not good at inflicting it on people but quite the opposite. I was too good at it and having fed the darkness within, the high was better than any drug. Fast forward some years and I am attending a local community college and while I am no longer running with the same violent crowd but I still see them every now and then. I am taking some classes with my friend's little sister and having seen her go from a bratty little girl to a woman kind of made it like she was another younger sister to me. She had started dating a guy who I knew from reputation to be a real piece of shit from high school. This guy was a year younger than me and the rumors floating around was the school did nothing about how he would grope females in the hallway because he was the star WR for the football team. He lost his scholarship to the state college due to his grades but the rumor was he had a few assault allegations that were swept under the rug. I inform her of what I know about the guy but she does not listen to me. After class, I approach the POS to inform him that his GF is someone I think of as a little sister and to tread lightly. She attended a school function with POS and then she was missing from all of her classes for the next week so I drop off the notes at her parents' house. I found out POS had roofied her drink, took advantage of her at the function, and left her there under the bleachers for people to be found. To make matters even worst he gave her a few STDs. The revenge on my part was I knew where he parked for classes every day. So I skipped class and waited for him to go return to his car to beat him down. Due to him driving an SUV I knew he kept a broom in there for cleaning off his car for snow. I had taken a pair of brass knuckles and I went to town on him. I grabbed the broom and carried him into the woods to stick that broom where the sun don't shine. I left him bent over a picnic table with the broom sticking out his ass like I just planted a flag. I stroll into the local pharmacy to pick up some hydrogen peroxide to clean off the blood and I go visit her older brother at the prison to give him a heads up. I tell him what happened, what I did and to keep an eye out for him on the inside. I must have a guardian angel as the list of people who wanted him dead for doing similar things was quite long. I got questioned about him but I gave them nothing and pointed them towards the people I suspected might have been victims of him in the past. The Blackhole revenge. I made a few inquires into where this POS was going to be sent to once he got out of the hospital. Turns out he was going into one of the camps at the same prison the older brother was at. Even though it was a different unit it was still close enough in the sphere of influence that he could be gotten to. I was given a few names to make contact with and drop off some cash for the commissary to grease a few wheels to get at POS. I figured that he would have been shanked and it would have been done with him. Turns out POS was gang-assaultd by 10 guys one of which infected him with HIV. They slit his rectum to make it wetter and to increase the possibility of infection. After doing all of the messaging I was approached by someone who played a cell phone video of the whole thing before I went into class. Turns out he died of sepsis a few weeks later. The orderly was pocketing the antibiotics and pain pills. He was double-dipping as he was paid to do this and he sold off those pills as well. The only witness to my part of the revenge was now dead and all that was left was trying to rebuild little sis. I know I am going to hell for this but I do not care. Maybe the nightmares I had for years after this will be penance enough but who knows."
  a persistent bicycle space thief met their match when the owner locked their bike and refused to unlock it. Lesson learned.,"Using my parking space? All good, you will be using it FOREVER.

So Im living in Japan now and here people ride bicycles a lot. You cant leave your bike anywhere and you have to pay for parking, between 1 and 2 dollars per day. There are very few free parking areas for bicycles. Most people leave their bikes at the same place so they pay monthly because its cheaper and you have your own space. This started a couple of weeks ago. Someone in my building started having a guest who decided to steal my bicycle parking space whenever they came to vistit. Sometimes they stayed the whole night so I had to go to the station, pay one dollar and come all they way home walking, which meant I would need to walk to the station the next day (getting up earlier, walk like 20 minutes to the station while carrying my heavy bag). All the bicycle spaces have a number, which means they are reserved for someone. Mine is the 105 but this f*ker decided to take mine whenever they came to visit. The second time this happened, I told the building manager but they didn’t do anything. The third time I saw the bicycle there (it was the same red expensive bicycle) I left a note in Japanese saying “please don’t leave your bicycle here, this is my space and I am using everyday. I found the note taped (with the tape I used to tape it on their bike) to my parking space and it had a couple of bad words in Japanese at the end. Basically he was not only stealing my space but making fun of me by insulting me. Fine, its just fine… I probably wouldn’t have done anything about it if he hadn’t written those words, this triggered me and got the worst in me. This person did it again a couple of times, so I knew this would continue. I was thinking about buying another bicycle, a better more expensive one I could use to go on cycling trips so a good chain/ luck was needed anyway. I bought one of the thickest they had at the store and decided to try its efficiency. I locked his bicycle next time I saw it there. It hasn’t moved for the last 7 days. There where two notes, the first one was a very aggressive one, with more bad words and threats about going to the police (which I don’t care, lets go that way buddy), second note days later was an apology and they begged for me to unlock the bike because they tried to brake it but they couldn’t. I guess he has learned his lesson. Im pretty sure he wont do it again but I just want to enjoy this "
"  a disruptive neighbor repeatedly damages a mailbox, but faces consequences when it is reinforced and he crashes into it.","New a hole in a peaceful neighborhood learns his lesson

So I live in a quiet little town in the Midwestern United States. My house is the last house at the end of a sleepy little dead-end road. New guy moves in next door, let’s call him “meat”. meat was probably one of those guys who was so popular in high school that he thought he had it made without doing any work and tried to spend the rest of his life living off being the “cool guy”. Type of guy who drives a lifted truck and a motorcycle. (Don’t get me wrong, I ride motorcycles myself. What I don’t do, is sit in my driveway at 2 AM and rev my engine.) There’s a bit of a downhill slope from the middle of the street to our houses at the end, and meat likes to race down this hill, then lock his brakes and “drift” into his driveway. The first winter after he moved in, I notice that my mailbox has been crushed and there’s fresh tire tracks in the snow leading down the street, over my mailbox, and into his driveway. A few days later I see meat standing outside and ask about this. He denies the entire thing says he doesn’t know what happened to my mailbox and that it must’ve been a delivery guy or something. I figure whatever and fix my mailbox. A few months later the same thing happens again. I fixed my mailbox and move on. Sometime later, this happens yet again. This time, I’m pretty pissed. So, I talked to my cousin who’s a commercial welder and had him make me a mailbox out of some scrap quarter-inch steel plate which was mounted on a length of old railroad track for its post. A little bit of glue and some cedar shingles and you’d never know it wasn’t a typical wooden mailbox. Also, the railroad track “post” was sunk in concrete four feet into the ground. For the next several weeks I waited with anticipation every time I heard his truck roaring down the street, but nothing. Until, about five months later when I heard his truck, then a crash. By this time I had forgotten about my mailbox and thought for sure he’d struck another car. I ran out to the street to see if anyone needed help, and there was his truck broadside against my mailbox all smashed up. He saw me walk up and started yelling about how I had destroyed his truck and he’d make me pay, and he called the cops. A cop showed up to take his report and meat pointed out how my mailbox had been specifically designed to destroy his truck. I gotta admit, I got nervous at this point. The cop looked around at the truck and the construction of the mailbox then turned back to us and asked me if I’d had trouble with my mailbox before. I explained how it has been smashed several times in the past year. The cop then said “It’s pretty clear what happened here. This is an obvious case of wanton destruction of property.” My heart sunk to the ground and meat got a smug look on his face, but then cop turns to meat and says “I’m going to issue a citation for this, as well as reckless driving”. You should have seen meats face at this point. He was boiling with rage as the cop wrote him two tickets AND told him he needed to pay for the repair of the damaged wood on my mailbox. (The metal was fine, hadn’t even tilted it, but the wood camouflage had broken off)"
"  an employee, undervalued by owner, resigns after bonus discrepancy, starts successful competing business, takes clients and former teammates.","You're replaceable. . . Okay, bye!

I worked for a company for just under 5 years. The company I worked for existed for an additional 10 years prior to me. While I worked at this company, it ballooned to be the number one provider in the region for its unique service with about 75% of the market. It was a small business of about 15 employees. I loved my job and the skills I learned while working there were quite valuable. I loved my team, and the clients we provided services for. My twice yearly reviews with the owner were always 10/10 with no recommendations for improvement. I was exceptional at my job in every way. I handled company operations, HR/payroll, customer service, marketing, employee management, schedules, employee and client training, and many other things at this company. I was also able to step in and do any of my teammates jobs if they were out sick or on vacation. The owner of the company was giving out a bonus late summer last year and mine, while being more than previous years, was notably less than my teammates. I asked owner, ""Are the bonuses related to performance, and if so, what could I have done to earn more?"" Owner replied, ""The bonuses are not performance related, you are just more replaceable than the others."" ""Oh, okay,"" I replied and I proceeded to process each of the bonuses then went to lunch. I called my spouse to gain wisdom and advice. I was pretty lit but didn't want to make a rash decision. My spouse is very intelligent and, while they are not a fortuneteller, they have an ability to foresee various responses and all the potential outcomes. They are business wise and have been on the executive team of a large company for the past 21 years while also serving on several community boards and business advisory boards. We decided together to continue forward with our scheduled vacation and use the time away to calm our minds, relax, have fun, and to also determine the best course of action for me. We were leaving after working one more day, so I worked like all was normal the rest of the day and the following day, then left on vacation. While away we discussed several scenarios, the potential outcomes, consulted with a business advisor and a business attorney. With all the advice I received I determined that upon my return from vacation, I would resign from my role with a two week notice. However, in a fit of rage I was immediately terminated by owner. Which was one of the scenarios we thought would happen, so I was prepared for owner's poor reaction. During the next couple weeks, I created and opened a competing business offering similar services. However; I offered more customizable options with higher quality service and results. I knew our clients wanted these options and had proposed said options several times at old workplace but was never green lighted to implement the changes for no reason other than owner didn't come up with the idea so it was a stupid idea. I also maintained communications with a few people from my old team. My old team did not relay the day to day happenings at my previous workplace and I never asked about the company; however, they would vent to me on occasion. I would listen without comment. I knew service, quality, and the work environment in general suffered since my departure. Moral went down and clients were less satisfied. I also read the Google and Facebook reviews for old company. Yikes! Additionally, two full time and one part time persons were hired to fill my role and a portion of my responsibilities, like HR and payroll, were filled by outside companies. I quickly built up my business and within 3 months was able to hire several of my old teammates. They were able to jump in on day one with minimal training as they were the best employees at my old workplace. The quality of previous workplace's offerings continued to fall which sent additional business my way and quickly caused incoming work to be nonexistent at old workplace. My old workplace went from being the number one provider of unique service in the region to nothing in a matter of months. My previous employer is now searching for gainful employment. I know this because over the weekend owner applied for a position at my spouse's company. Side note: I think my spouse's company should bring my previous employer in for an interview but when they arrive, surprise! I'm the interviewer and all I say is, ""How replaceable am I now?"" My spouse, rightfully so, has said, ""No."" Moral of the story, don't tell your employees they are replaceable because they might create a competing business that is better than yours, while taking your best employees and your clients which will leave you with no business to sell (owner's whole retirement plan was to sell business) and starting all over by searching for employment under someone else. Looks like your company was replaceable, not me."
"  how incoming college freshmen should be open to changing majors, explore other classes, utilize libraries, attend clubs, and consider part-time jobs.","People in College, what’s the one high school habit each incoming freshman needs to stop doing on their first day of college?

Be ready to change your major if you need to. What you actually do in a given field of study is often radically different than what you'd imagine. Had a friend go into physics, spent the last two years of his degree programming simulations. Switch early enough and you won't have too many headaches.
You can sneak into other classes. No one is going to stop or even notice you. Do this a lot and you'll eventually be able to talk about just about anything.
Use the library. Steal from databases. Outside of college, knowledge is expensive and libraries are sorely underfunded.
Most clubs are kind of bullshit. Attend anyway. Catch a couple club members outside of the meetings, get a couple drinks in them, and you'll probably get something closer to what you were looking for.
Even if you're living off your folks, if you can swing a part-time job, get one. Having a bit of scratch makes having a social life a lot easier (and it's going to stay that way after you graduate, regardless of how cozy you are.) Having a social life makes having an intellectual/professional life a lot easier, too. The right friends can do wonders for your academic performance."
"  a newly married woman overhears husband admitting to friends he doesn't find her beautiful, causing her to feel hurt and insecure.","My husband admitted to his friends that he didn’t find me beautiful. Nothing feels the same anymore.

I’m newly married. After our honeymoon my husband had a group video call with his best friends. After I said hello and chatted for a bit with them I excused myself to go for a walk. I decided I needed to get my raincoat because it looked like it was about to rain but my husband and his friends thought I’ve already got out. They started interrogation about our honeymoon and they were all teasing and laughing until one of his best friends asked him if my looks were still an issue for him. My husband told her that he loved me and that we had a great honeymoon and that I’m beautiful on the inside and he said “you can’t have it all”. She insisted on wondering wether he felt he’d downgraded from his ex girlfriend and he said “maybe, but she (me)makes me happy.” Another friends then interjected and said I wasn’t bad looking if I lost some weight, my husband agreed.
Nothing feels the same anymore. I always knew I wasn’t beautiful but I thought that he liked how I looked, or at least, didn’t mind it so much. I know he values my other qualities and that he loves me and is very kind to me but I don’t feel good with him and I haven’t been happy since that day (5 weeks ago).
I have lost weight under these weeks and he’s paid me a lot of compliments about that but I don’t want him commenting anything about my physical appearance anymore. I hate every encouraging word he has to say and yet I feel like I need to be more appealing to him. I feel so much hurt it’s insane! "
"  man loves best friend of 24 years who transitioned to a woman, but fears confessing will jeopardize their friendship.","My best friend of 24 years (born a male) is now a transgender woman. I'm in love with her and not sure if I should tell her

My friend and I (both 24 years old) have been best friends our entire lives, we're practically brothers. Our parents grew up together, went to the same schools - so my friend and I were together ever since we were little babies. We've always had each other's back, protected one another, cared for each other - when the whole world felt like it was against us, the both of us knew we were always looking out for each other. My friend is an amazing person, someone I can go to and trust completely. I'm blessed to have this person in my life.
My friend transitioned to a female a few months ago, she's completely physically a woman. She's been through hormone replacement therapy these past few years, seeing her becoming so much more happier is amazing to see. I'm absolutely proud of her! It's beautiful to see my friend now be so free, being comfortable with herself and always having the greatest smile on her face. But I'm falling for her, and these feelings aren't going away. I'll admit that I'm in love with my friend, the friend I've known for 24 years is who is stealing my heart and I don't know what to do. I don't want to lose my friend, but my feelings of friendship for her are turning to romantic/sexual feelings & attraction.
After my friend transitioned, we continued hanging out and talking like nothing changed. We continued going out to clubs/bars, the movies, restaurants, playing video games - nothing changed, we kept doing what we always did. During this time when my feelings began to change, I started falling in love with her. You know what attracted me? Her, the way she is. My friend is now acting like herself, acting free and full of life - always laughing, dancing and being goofy. It hurts me, because this is someone I grew up with and I'm afraid my feelings are going to push her away or make this awkward. Like always I'm insanely happy being with my friend, but my feelings for her are killing me right now everytime we're together again.
I've fallen in love with her true self, her true self is absolutely beautiful.
I've spoken to another close friend of mine about this, I just got made fun of. ""Haha! You wanna f  your bro, seriously?!"" Is practically what I got. They didn't understand where I was coming from, they didn't understand what an insanely amazing person my friend is. This friend of mine feels it's ""creepy"" and ""nasty"" that I'm falling for my best friend. They also aren't taking my friend's transition seriously, which is another reason why they're acting immature. All he did was make fun of me, so ever since then I haven't spoken to anyone else about how i feel.
Also, aside from being scared of losing my friend, I'm afraid of what our families will think. What happens if my friend and I do end up together, and our families suddenly start to panic. I'm afraid of not only ruining my friendship, but the friendship our parents have with themselves for many years. Both of our families were completely supportive when my friend transitioned, not a single negative comment. Everyone is proud of her, and the love our families have for her hasn't changed at all. I feel I'm over thinking all of this, especially because being friends is very different from being in a serious relationship.
If anything, our families would be insanely happy we're together and be so annoying hahaha. But I'm more worried about the negative response, which is why I believe I'm over thinking this whole thing.
Plus, if I plan to even confess my feelings for her - I have to do it soon. She's always being asked out on dates, but she tells me she's looking for the right person to spend time with. I feel this is my opportunity to confess, but I don't know if I should. I don't just want to confess how I feel about her, I want an actual relationship with my friend.
If any of you have some advice, please definitely share it! because I have no clue what to do. I'll love to tell my friend how I feel about her, but I don't want to lose or ruin our 24 year friendship. I also don't want to make it seem that I'm falling for her just because she's now a woman, I don't want her to feel that way at all. What do you all think I should do? I'll absolutely appreciate the advice/input, I'll greatly appreciate it so much."
"  person shot stalker 5 years ago, now harassing again after parole release. Frustrated with lack of help. Seeking options for protection.","Shot my stalker in the chest 5 years ago in self defense. He immediately started harassing me again a few days after being released from parole supervision.

Throwaway because the stalker comments on pretty much every post I make on my main account. I even got flagged for karma manipulation for having a ""friend"" comment on my post. He's not my friend.
Anyway, 5 years ago I was stalked for six months by a guy I knew less than a month as an actual person. We dated very briefly, I broke things off and things seemed amicable until he started showing up outside my house and demanding I be with him or else.
He had decided that he was a good man and he deserved a chance. He threatened that if he didn't get a chance, he'd off me or hopefully I'd off myself.
After 6 months of daily threats, 10+ police reports, multiple restraining order attempts, moving, getting rid of all social media, he found me and kicked my door in at midnight. I ended up shooting him. After a lot of games on his part(refusing to come to court, self imposed starvation) he was finally sentenced and went to jail for 5 years.
I guess he was on parole for about 4 months after his release because I immediately started receiving messages and comments from him, he just picked right back up where he left off. I contacted the parole board and they said he was released from supervision a few days before.
I have contacted the police, and was approved for a restraining order but of course they haven’t been able to serve it.
They said they can’t prove the messages are from him despite him using his name, posting his pictures and literally commenting on my name and talking about the shooting in comment replies. The detective is waiting for a subpoena from reddit to prove it’s him. I am documenting every bit of harassment of course..but I am just...exhausted.
I am so incredibly frustrated with the lack of help available and closed doors there are for people being stalked.
Is there anything else I can do in the meantime?"
"  persistent pursuit pays off as rejected suitor proposes through a Scrabble game, eventually leading to a 23-year-long marriage.","People who have been denied when they proposed, what was the end result?

People who have been denied when they proposed, what was the end result? My dad proposed to my mom the night he met her. The way they explain it, they ""bared their souls to each other"" that might. They talked for hours uninterrupted. And even though my dad wasn't looking to get married, he just knew. She said no, but did say yes to another night out. He proposed again. She said no, but again, accepted another date. This went on nearly daily for 6 months. One night, my parents played Scrabble against each other for the first time. My mom loves Scrabble. She kicks people's ass up and down the block, and this is a woman who takes pride in being well read enough to serve as a quick reference thesaurus. After a hard fought game, she lost for the first time she could remember. And my 105 pound 5 foot nothing mother swept the board and pieces of the table sending them flying across the room. She looked at my dad and said in a fury, ""Fine, I'll marry you!"" My dad responded, in classic male fashion, ""Uh. I need to think about it."" He thought about it, and barely 8 months after they met, my parents married in a tiny chapel in Vegas. They celebrated 23 years this year."
"  terrifying encounter in the forest with a lurking voyeur; led to a missing boy, guilt, addiction, trauma, and lasting night terrors.","What is the scariest encounter with another human you have ever experienced?

What is the scariest encounter with another human you have ever experienced? I was at a sleepover and my friend and I decided to visit the forest of the school grounds. There were rumours of a great playboy collection there, hence our visit. While there my friend stepped off to the side to have a pee. A few seconds later he comes rushing back and says “run”. I didn’t know what his deal was but as a kid in the forest with only the light of the moon, I figured asking questions was a secondary option to being left alone there. We ran until we couldn’t run anymore. Finally my friend explained that there was some weirdo looking at him pee. He said that the guy was rubbing one out. Being kids with a history of pranks I thought he was messing with me. Then I looked back and saw the guy a long way back but moving in our direction. We kept running towards my friend’s place and he kept following. When we got back we thought we lost him. We snuck back inside and turned off all of the lights in the basement. We laid there silently and terrified. About 10 minutes later we see something move by the window. We knew someone was out there. We stayed completely still and quiet. A minute later we hear a noise coming from a room in the basement. We both lost it and started yelling for my friend’s dad. He came running down the stairs and we were yelling that someone is in that room. His dad flung open the door and the window was open and there were fresh marks on the wall from someone climbing in or out. For some reason he didn’t call the police. He decided to stay downstairs with us for the night. I didn’t really sleep and in the morning my friend’s dad made me walk home with him. A few blocks away and there were a bunch of police. As we walked by one of the cops stopped us and asked if we saw anything suspicious last night. We told him the story which kicked off further questioning. It turns out that a kid went missing from his room right around the same time that we got chased home. They found the guy a few days later and he had taken his own life. He had also abducted a boy. They never found the boy he abducted. We had a lot of trouble with that. My friend’s dad felt guilty for not calling the police. He became addicted to sleeping pills. My friend was traumatized with just how close he came to being grabbed in the forest. He turned to drugs and eventually took his own life. I went through therapy for awhile and still have occasional night terrors from that night even though it happened almost 30 years ago."
"  tragic car accident claims husband's life, revealing massive hidden debt. Widow faces financial turmoil, seeks legal help and support.","My husband was killed in a car accident and I have found out we are tens of thousands of dollars in debt.

My husband was killed in a car accident and I have found out we are tens of thousands of dollars in debt. My husband passed away very suddenly recently and in the weeks since his passing I have discovered that he was keeping huge secrets from me. In going through our financial information, I have discovered multiple credit cards in his, mine and the kids names that are at maximum balance, 2 sets of loan papers from different banks for over $20,000, paperwork that says our mortgage is 4 months behind and a ton of other things that I can barely make sense of. From what I can tell, his business hasn't been making any actual money in over a year and our savings accounts are drained. There is evidence that he has been using some gambling website and has lost thousands and thousands of dollars. I've been a stay at home mom for our entire marriage and he owned his own business so he handled everything with the money. I have no idea how to deal with any of this or what to do. I know I need a lawyer but our accounts are pretty much empty and I am at a total loss over what to do. Edit: I was able to find some legal help and we are working on sorting out the mess my family is in. Things were far worse than I even knew when I made my first post. All together, the debt that was accumulated is close to half a million dollars. At this point I have no idea how much I am going to end up responsible for. The lawyer has said it could take years to sort everything out. No matter what happens, we are going to be losing the house. I am working on finding us somewhere to stay before they actually foreclose so we don't get evicted and have that on my record too. I have 3 kids, so that is what I keep saying. The older two are from a previous relationship but I have contacted social security to get benefits started for my youngest. My husband's business was a tech repair company he ran by himself. He had a few people he would call in to help with larger jobs but 95% of everything was him alone. The last year or so it appears he wasn't doing any actual work and there was no money coming in. He took money from the business to cover what he took from our personal accounts and then took out loans to cover the business and pissed it all away on gambling and repaying his debts to various gangs, something I don’t know about and have no idea how he has any ties with gangs nor do I know what he did with the money. It is looking increasingly likely that the crash was intentional. Nobody else was involved, his car went off the road and hit a tree. He had life insurance before, but he stopped paying the policy months ago. I am in contact with the police about the credit cards in our names and the other things that were discovered. All in all, things are looking really bleak at the moment but I have faith that eventually it will work out. I have a few leads on jobs and have picked up a little temp work here and there the last few weeks so that we have something coming in. I have signed up for food stamps and Medicaid so once that goes through it will be a bit of help. I applied for housing authorities as well but they said the waitlist can be a few years so that is a kind of longshot. My sister will hopefully be able to let us stay with her temporarily until I can sort things out and get us back together. She is my only living family and has been my rock through all this."
"  a college roommate's mental health deteriorated after experiencing sexual assault, facing disbelief and dismissal from those around her.","Have you ever seen someone’s mental health degrade completely?

Have you ever seen someone’s mental health degrade completely? My college roommate, after she had a man force himself onto her. I met her junior year when she was randomly assigned as my roommate. Through the year, we became close. She was this happy, jolly girl that never failed to make me laugh. I'm not kidding, sometimes I would have an asthma attack from laughing so hard. I taught her how to drive in my car and oh the times we had. We became really close so I decided to live with her the following year. Except, the girl who came back from summer break just wasn't her. Till this day, I miss who she used to be. I miss the times we had, I miss her. We moved in and things seem to get weird. She stopped sleeping at night. She would do laundry at weird points in the night. She started waking me up in the middle of the night asking if I heard the voice or saw the shadow pass by. Upon asking, she would say she was just tired. About 2 months in, I overheard her crying on the phone and she came to me to tell the truth. She had a man force himself on her from church back home. She was talking to her family, I heard her dad say: ""You need to move on already"" and her brother basically said: ""I don't even think that ever happened."" Her co-worker told her that she must have been asking for it or provoked the guy in some way. Basically everyone around her dismissed her or made her feel worse for even telling her truth. She shut down. She stopped talking to anyone, only me, sometimes. I distinctly remember her saying, multiple times, ""Hey, sometimes I think people's reaction to my truth makes me feel worse than the actual event."" Her mental health quickly deteriorated after that. She stopped leaving the apartment. She would order food under fake names and sometimes under my name. She stopped going to work or classes. She became a paranoid person and just thought that those people would get her. She just shut down. She admitted that she had locked herself in the bathroom a few times with a knife. I remember sitting on her bed with her, late nights, and just let her cry and talk to me. It used to pain me so much because I couldn't do anything except just be there for her. I blamed myself for a really long time for not being able to do something more. Then she disappeared. She packed her bags, dropped out of college and just left. I tried to reach out to her but all these years, I never heard from her. I never forgot about her. She had worked so hard, took loans, came from a very very poor background, worked multiple jobs and had made it all the way to 4th year in a prestige university. She came from a really bad background and wanted to just make it through college. Most people in her family never even made it through high school so she would be the first to not just attend but graduate from college. She had this dream of being a college graduate and working as a translator in the government somewhere. If only she had the right help, the right people, the right support system? Maybe she might have made it."
  a casino bartender witnessed a regular family's sad story unfold as they coped with terminal illness and developed addictions.,"People of Reddit who work in a casino, what’s some of the saddest moments you witnessed?

People of Reddit who work in a casino, what’s some of the saddest moments you witnessed? I was a bar bartender at a casino. I had a lot of regulars. I got to the point that I knew what drink people wanted and how often they would want one, and what they would switch too based on wins or losses. I had a regular family that gambled together. A father, mother and daughter who was about my age. After a year or two of seeing them come in at least once, sometimes twice a week, we got to know each other pretty well. The parents would always try to set me up with the daughter, she wasn't my type and I was in a relationship at the time so I always let them down easy. Anyway, it came to pass that the father got diagnosed with terminal cancer. Mother and daughter came in way more often, almost everyday, complaining of the high medical bills every chance they got, how the father was suffering so much. I felt so bad for the father. Knowing he was dying of cancer and instead of having family there for him, they were at the casino spending money that may or not have been needed on medical bills and end of life care. Regardless of the money. Seeing them at the casino while he suffered alone was a lot to deal with. I wish I could've said something, but I needed my job more than moral high ground. After he passed away. The mother and daughter were there the next day. I brought their drinks. I also brought his favourite drink, a white russian. The mother cried. She stopped coming in as much for a little while. I don't feel like it was a spiteful act. But I think it did put things into perspective for them. Probably too little too late. I was invited to the funeral but unfortunately had to work. They were way better tippers when the father was alive. And after he died the mother would order as many screwdrivers as I was legally allowed to give her. So she and her daughter started really having a crippling gambling addiction as well as possibly developing alcoholism. I hope they are better now. They were excellent, nice caring people, who had an addiction."
"  unexplained encounters with a creepy man: watching through mirrors, appearing at different locations, and unsettling confrontations, leaving lingering questions.","What is the most unexplained thing that’s happened to you that you still wonder about to this day?

What is the most unexplained thing that’s happened to you that you still wonder about to this day? Years ago my best friend and I were in a cafe just wasting time and we saw a man watching us through a mirror hanging on a wall across from us. Something about this man was so bone-chilling, so creepy, our gut immediately kicked in and we both looked at each other, and acknowledged how creepy and off this man was. He continued to watch us so we left the cafe and joked about on our walk home, we were about 16 and just brushed it off. About a week later this man came into my work, his face and whole presence was unforgettable. I texted my best friend and informed her that he was at my work, yet again, staring at me without ever looking away, he was pretending to browse the store’s inventory but obviously intended on not buying anything. He stared and stared. I told a co-worker and walked away for a bit. Strange, but small community and you see people everywhere. Side note, both my best friend and I have lived in this community for most of our lives and had never seen this man. Alright fast forward to a few weeks later and we are at a store late evening in a completely different part of our huge city and we are browsing and the man is there, at this shop that we hardly visit, late, and he was there, he walks in the downstairs entrance and looks directly up at us, as we were looking over the upstairs railing. We nervously giggle and shout profanities, in disbelief this really off putting man is here, it was crazy. We told our other friends we were with and we immediately left. A little later he returned to my place of work, spooking me just as much as he did the first time I saw him. My co-worker and manager tell me to go upstairs and pretend to do something to not be around him, he immediately follows me upstairs and then my manager follows him, as he is aware of the situation and my strange sightings of this man. He hastily walks up to the desk I was behind and before my manager can pull him away from me & ask him to leave the store, he looks right at me and says “can I ask you something? Do I make you uncomfortable?”. I don’t know what it was but something took over my body and I was filled with dread and fear and immediately started crying. I have never had anything like this happen to me. This man had never talked to me before, just looked at my friend and I really intently. My manager tells him he needs to go now and never come back. The thing is, everyone immediately picked up on the very strange, creepy, uncomfortable energy he put out. My co-worker had no idea what he looked like as I had never explained, and he immediately pointed him out when he entered our work and asked if that was him."
"  youngest sister's harrowing experience with psychopathic oldest sister who inflicted physical and emotional abuse, displaying manipulative behavior and violent tendencies.","Siblings of psychopaths when did you realize your sibling wasn't normal?

My oldest sister is a psychopath. I'm the youngest of three girls and we grew up fairly poor so both parents were out of home a lot working to give us the basics. Because of this my oldest sister ""looked after"" us. My earliest memories involve me running through the kitchen in a diaper feeling so scared trying to get away from her. Anything and everything set her off. If attention was not 100% on her she would flip out, scratching, kicking, hair pulling. My parents were pretty oblivious to all this, or more my dad was also unstable (BPD who frequently went off meds) and my mum was too emotionally abused to do anything to help. She had to have presents on everyone else's birthday, had to have the same presents as everyone else on christmas, or better ones. As I was 4 years younger I was much smaller than her and easy to catch. From my toddler years to 16 I had crescent scars all over my arms and ankles because she would dig her nails into my skin. The very first time it clicked in my head that no one would ever help and she could manipulate her way out of everything is when she stabbed me in the shoulder with a pen. I was about 8 years old. She had yanked out a chunk of my hair so I told her to ""eff off!"". The look on her face was horrifying because she looked so happy because my dad had been sleeping and woke up to me swearing which was strictly not allowed. She knew I was going to be in trouble so she grabbed the pen off the table and stabbed me then yanked it back out. I ran upstairs to get away from my dad, which was a whole different scary experience and he wouldn't believe that she had hurt me. I came downstairs a few hours later when he ""allowed"" it, with blood all over my shirt. My aunt was staying with us and saw it, pointed it out to my dad and they still believed my sister hadn't done it. I gave up all hope for help after that. That turned into 8 years of her scarring any exposed skin, pulling out my hair, cornering me and screaming about how disgusting I was, taking every moment to remind me I was fat (She has been anorexic/bulimic most of her teens and adult life), throwing things at me, telling me men will only like me because they're chubby chasers, etc. I am more of an extrovert than most of my family so I always had a lot of friends and ""boyfriends"" in elementary school and then actual boyfriends in highschool. When she went away to university my mother thought it would be a great idea for me to visit her there. A whole weekend being alone in her dorm with her. She spent the first day reminding me how disgusting I was, then acted all nice until the evening. She wanted me to watch ""West Side Story"", I think, it's the one with the opening scene of the two gangs finger snapping down the street. Me being 16 thought it was funny so I laughed. Wrong move. She started screaming, threw out all the food, cornered me and let me know how no one in my life actually likes me and they're all just putting up with me because they don't know any better, I'll only ever be in abusive relationships, I don't deserve anything better than that, I'll always be fat and disgusting, etc. Then she kicked me out and made our mother pick me up a day early. Mid year she was home and in a rare moment of civility she wanted to ""talk"". She asked me how you're supposed to feel sorry for other people. As in how do you feel empathy? She couldn't figure it out when her professors talked about it. I carefully got out of that conversation. Later that day after she'd done her usual ""you're fat and disgusting"" rant I decided to turn my back on her and not engage. She picked up a text book and hit me as hard as she could over the head with it, yanked me by the back of my head and pushed me in the cupboards, to let me know ""you're not allowed to ignore me"". I have not spoken to her since that day, I'm now 26 and she's 30. She's still living off my mother and has zero social skills. The last time I saw her she had drank a bottle of wine on christmas eve 2011 and she just laid on the living room floor for the day. She's pulled a knife on our other sister, she's been evicted for trashing apartments that are in my mother's name, had so many pets die ""unexplainably"", expects to be showered with gifts and attention by everyone around her, she will get angry if family are paying more attention to children than they are to her, she still has to refer to our mother as ""mummy"" and in that high pitched voice, she can't hold any platonic relationship, has never had a romantic ones and she still hates me viciously for being able to have relationships. I will not be surprised if she ends up ending someone. She is the spitting image of our father in personality. She lives in another province from me, is still in school, and my mother is smart enough to never let her know where I live. Those close to me know who she is and know not to give any information."
"  man lets pet snake snuggle in his shorts, but it turns out to be a painful encounter with a dangerous outcome.","I let a large snake snuggle in the leg of my shorts. The outcome wasn’t pretty

At the time, I had a good sized Florida kingsnake named Gumbo. She was about four and a half feet long, about as thick as a broomstick. Despite her size and fierce looks, she was tame as a puppy. Even though she was as friendly as a snake can be, I had rules about when I'd handle her. If she'd eaten within the last day or two, the movement of being handled would make her poop. And snake poop is some nasty stuff. On the other hand, if it had been a while since her last feeding, she would be really fidgety and squirm around, looking for food. Luckily, on this particular Monday evening, it was prime Gumbo snuggle time. She had eaten on Friday, pooped over the weekend, and wouldn't eat again for a week. I grabbed her from her aquarium and plopped down on the couch to watch a few episodes of Futurama on Netflix. My wife sat on the other couch, doing her school work. But Gumbo was a pain in the ass. She kept trying to get away. Over my shoulders, behind the couch, in between the cushions, into my shirt, back out the collar. I spent most of an episode trying to get this little lady to chill out. I would've put her away, but I'll admit, this was back when I used to smoke and I was feeling pretty lazy at that moment. Finally we reached a very uneasy settlement, she curled up and stayed put just inside the left leg of my shorts. Now, I wasn't a fan of this idea. But I was feeling kind of lazy, and she was finally holding still, and I had just started wearing briefs instead of boxers. The elastic band around my thigh would keep her away from my manhood if she tried getting frisky. I watched my show in peace. Until she moved north. I felt her reach a zone of my body where she was not welcome, felt her push against the elastic band of my clothing. I started to reach to pull her away. Most of you will never know the white hot, electric pain that I felt in that moment, and I'm envious. Gumbo was old enough to have mastered the art of capturing rodent’s, and she had decided to make a meal of slumbering trouser mouse. A gaping maw of recurved, needle sharp teeth overtook the head of my manhood in the same way I'd seen her overpower so many mice and rats. I gasped, and my right hand shot down to pull away from the ravenous serpent. Now, a snake whose meal is being taken from it will react in one of two ways. A shy, small snake will give up, let go, slither away. But Gumbo was a fighter. I felt her tense all four plus feet of her body, steel herself against my thigh, and pull backward. My vision blacked out for a second. Still, my left hand dove in and grabbed her by the neck. And now my pickle was in a pickle. I couldn't let go with either hand, because she might pull more or swallow deeper. But if I didn't let go, she couldn't either.
Somehow, my wife had missed the whole thing. With more calm than I felt, I called her over and explained the situation. She gingerly helped me slide my pants off. Her eyes went wide. ""Wow. She's uh, she's really got you there."" We discussed the situation; I felt helpless. Luckily, she remembered that many zoos keep rubbing alcohol near the cages for their large constrictors. If the snake attacks, pour alcohol in its mouth and it'll let go. We were out of isopropyl, but we had some Bombay Sapphire gin. She ran and got it. In that moment, I learned that there is only one pain worse than a large snake trying to devour your manhood. It's pouring alcohol into the wounds being created by the large snake trying to devour your manhood. Luckily though, Gumbo and I shared a disgust for gin. She unhooked her teeth and backed away. My wife took her over to the sink and rinsed out her mouth while I pinched to staunch the blood flow. I ran to the bathroom and showered, cleaned my wounds, and assessed the damage. "
"  car accident victim endures excruciating pain and neglect in the hospital, with a broken hand overlooked multiple times until proven visible.","What's the worst hospital experience you've ever had?

I was in a car accident, and T boned by someone going 65 M P H. My hand was caught in between the collapsing car and the steering wheel. When I popped my hand out, I felt the bone break and it hurt a lot. Amazingly enough, I had no other injuries. But the EMT's were taking no chances, and thinking I was in shock, they strapped me onto a backboard and hauled me off to the ER. While in the ER, I was asked several times if I was injured anywhere, and I repeatedly said ""My hand is broken, it hurts real bad. By the way, this backboard is hurting the back of my head, can I get off of it, please? Also, can you please call my mother?"" 2 hours later, I was still on the backboard, and I had lost count of how many people had asked me where my injuries were and me repeating, ""my left hand is broken"", but that was when I was finally taken down to the X ray department. There, they X-ray'd every bone in my body but my left hand. I am wheeled back to the ER, still on that goddamn backboard. By this time, I have a horrendous headache from where my head is resting on that 2 by 4, and I sit for another couple of hours. During that time I was able to talk a nurse into bringing me a bedpan so I could relieve myself, and that is when the cop came in, opened the curtains so everyone could see me, and gave me a ticket. Finally, after having been in the ER for 6 hours, I finally talked someone into calling my mother to come pick me up, the doctor had finally said I could get off of the backboard and when my mom got there, he let me know I had no injuries. ""Yes, I do. My hand is broken."" ""Young lady, I'm the doctor, I'll tell you when your hand is broken."" That was when I grabbed my ring finger on my left hand and pulled it out, and the break became visible through the skin. ""My hand is broken."" Mom, being an attorney, just looked at the doctor and said ""Does the word malpractice mean anything to you?"" Back down to the X ray dept I went, and lo and behold, my hand was broken, but the Doctor was all how it was well hidden and that's why they missed it the first time. "
"  officer's haunting call: unresponsive baby, suspected SIDS. Mistaken for live baby in ER, waits alone in morgue. Heartbreaking, lingering trauma.","Cops, what has so far been the creepiest call you've ever had?

I responded to a report of an unresponsive infant. When I arrived, all the family members were standing around casually in the front yard pointing into the house. I found the baby in the back room laying on her back on a bare mattress. I started CPR, but realised the baby was probably already deceased. We rushed her out to the arriving ambulance hoping they had a way to bring her back. I learned she was the mother's second suspicious SIDS death, and I had her other children removed from her care. The difficult part was when I left the scene and went to the ER to see what came of the situation. As I walked in and asked where she was, an ER nurse walked over to me and handed me the deceased baby swaddled in a blanket and told me to wait for someone to show me to the morgue. So I'm standing there in the ER in uniform holding what everyone thinks is a live infant, and several people stop by wanting to see her and commenting on how cute it is to see an officer holding a baby. I just smiled, but I cried inside. I was ushered back to the morgue after what felt like an eternity, and told I had to wait with the baby until the medical examiner arrived. They took the blankets off and laid her on a stainless steel gurney and left me alone with her again. I lounged around the morgue for about an hour waiting. By the time I got home several hours after the end of my shift. I layed down on my bed and cried for a long time. My young daughter was in daycare, and my wife was at work. I really needed to hold both of them, so the house felt incredibly empty. My daughter was only slightly older than the infant, and when I was looking at her earlier, I kept seeing my own daughter. I didn't get any sleep at all before going back in for the next shift later that night."
"  a grandmother's severe alcoholism included neglect, hospitalizations, and a journey to recovery, ultimately finding stability and sobriety.","What's the worst case of alcoholism you have personally witnessed?

The worst case of alcoholism I've experienced was my grandma.
I remember about 20 years ago, my mom abruptly stopped allowing me and my siblings to see my grandma. At the time, she didn't give us a reason or explanation until I physically saw my grandma for myself. My grandpa, from whom she had separated from a few years prior, passed away. Grandma moved back into their home and cut off contact with my mom. Mom got concerned and decided to just drop in and check on her while mom and I were out running errands. I was around 10 at this point.
The entire house was empty except for a bare mattress on the living room floor. My grandma was semi conscious on the mattress, which was stained with urine and vomit. Liquor bottles and beer cans were everywhere. She was no longer of a healthy weight. She weighed about 80 pounds, at 5 foot 6. I remember trying to get her to eat while mom called an ambulance. She ate a few bites of bread before throwing up. Grandma was combative and aggressive, and was committed on a 72 hour hold. She agreed to go to rehab, for the 3rd time.
After her release, she moved across the country to stay with her sibling. A few more years pass with no contact. Mom found out grandma had moved back to our town without telling anyone in the family. By the time we learned of her return, she had gotten an apartment and a job, successfully becoming a functioning alcoholic.
The drinking progressed and she again lost her job. Somehow mom learned of her return and had a surprise visit. I was maybe 11 or 12 at this point, and was with my parents when they showed up at her apartment. The place was trashed with bottles and beer cans. This time, mom just let her go. I didn't see or speak to grandma for about 4 years. My aunt had a miracle baby which brought grandma back into our lives. At this point, she was sober and stable. Everything seemed like it was coming back together; she was welcomed back into our lives and slowly trust was rebuilt, as was our relationship with her.
After being sober for several years, grandma received a stage 3 cancer diagnosis. She admitted to us that she coped with the news by drinking a bottle. She said she woke up the next day feeling like hell and decided she didn't want to go out like that. She restarted her sobriety and opted for chemotherapy. A little over a year later, she was in remission.
That was 10 years ago. She is still sober. Recently, she had a terrible case of pneumonia and had to be in the hospital for several weeks followed by a 2 month stay in a nursing facility. My husband and I visited her there, and I had a breakdown when I saw her. She looked so frail, it reminded me of when she was drinking. I couldn't stop myself from crying. She just held my hand and told me everything would be okay.
Currently, she is well enough to live on her own. She's still sober, and I feel so blessed to have her in my life."

This guy was my closest friend.
I lived with him after letting him co rent a place my mother owns so he could pay lower rent and save up his spare cash. About six months in he keeps vanishing at night, giving reasons like ""I'm going out with work"" and ""I'm meeting the lads"", turns out he was sleeping with my girlfriend and didn't have the nuts to confront me about it and talk it through. After months of angry messages I cut my losses and decided to be the bigger man. By this time I've found myself a new girl who is utterly amazing and my best friend is dating my ex girlfriend. So I put my best foot forward and on a trip around Europe sent him a message telling him I'm happy to put things behind us and when I get back we'll sit down with a couple of the german beers I was bringing back and get back to being mates.

She sits me down and explains that over the past couple of weeks my friend has been sending her text messages begging her to sleep with him. She shows me the messages and I haven't spoken to the guy since. The urge was to meet him with a baseball bat, but that idea was quickly dismissed as lunacy."
"  engaged to high school sweetheart, relationship soured. After breakup, ex demanded engagement ring, assaulted protagonist, legal involvement ensued.","What is your ""crazy ex"" story?

I was engaged to my high school sweetheart who I pretty much allowed to treat me like dirt for years. After high school, while we were living together, it was apparent that the relationship wasn't going anywhere and I finally found the courage to end it. I was the one with the job and the money so I was keeping the apartment and asked her to move out. I think I gave her like two weeks or something but it was a long time ago. Eventually she shacked up with some guy I think and was out of my hair. Every now and then she would pop in because she left all of her shit at my place while she was ""trying to find a new place"". I kept hearing stories from everyone of her epicly high body count and just tried to stay away from it as best I could. At some point though, out of anger, I went into her jewellery box and took back the engagement ring I'd given her. It was several weeks before she realised it was gone and I'd already sold it by then and told her so when she confronted me in my apartment.
She lost her shit.
She started demanding that I give it back to her or at least its value in cash. I told her that's not how engagement rings work and she can go away. She started hitting me and trashing my place. I didn't have to take it, but she was smaller than me and I was, at the time, a black belt but I just let her take out her anger. She ripped my shirt, slapped me, punched, kicked, bit, everything. Finally she hit me square in the face and drove my head into the door behind me. On the other side of that door was a calendar hanging on a nail that stuck through the door just a small amount but enough to drive into the back of my skull and it go through my skull forcing me to bleed a little. I just grabbed her hands to stop her from flailing anymore and directed her over to the door. She could tell that I had lost my patience so she just stormed out.
About an hour later she shows back up, this time with her Mom and the police. The cop took my statement, took one look at me and asked me if I wanted to press charges or if I needed an ambulance. I declined both and then he escorted her and her Mom off the property and advised that they take it up with small claims court if they wanted to proceed any further."
  gym girl's unconventional stretch technique led to a cute date and ongoing playful moments. They're still together and happy.,"Men, what is the wildest thing a woman has ever done to gain your attention?

There was one girl that worked at the gym I go to, she was really nice and we talked pretty often. One day I stayed until she was about to close the gym, and just before she closed she said she needed to do stretches because she had a dance class the next day. She invited me to do the stretches with her, I thought she meant me just helping her, like pushing her down or lifting and holding her, just being of assistance to her. Instead she wanted me to do them with her, as in do the stretches myself. Now, she's a semi professional dancer practising modern dance, her stretches are not human, not something i can even think of doing.
So I bite the bullet and do them anyway because why not, she's nice and it's kinda funny toppling over every time I try to do something. Anyway, at some point we were to do one of those stretches where you sit down, put the soles of your feet up against each other, pull them as close to your body as you can while still keeping them on the floor, and then push your knees down while bending forward. After toppling over a couple times I managed to get stable and actually do it but I can't get my knees very low because I am stiff and have shortened tendons in my legs. She laughs literally rolling on the floor crying from laughter.
So to help me she gets up behind me, mounts me, literally climbs on my back, spreads her legs around my ribs and starts pushing down my knees with her own knees. All she had to do was stand in front of me and push my knees down with her palms, but instead of doing that she saddles me like a horse. She ends up falling over me and I grab her as she's falling over so she doesn't hit the ground face first. It ends up looking like one of those cringe cliche anime moments. She fell on her back and I fell on top of her with my hands around her. Safe to say I had a hard time keeping my composure because she's really good looking, being a dancer and all.
It really didn't feel crazy at the time, I found it pretty cute honestly. We ended up having an impromptu date that night, when I asked her why on earth would she mount me like that she said that she just wanted a reason to climb on me. We're still together and to this day I still tease her about it, and she still keeps climbing on top of me."
  wife tells husband to shut his mouth at a kid's birthday party. Husband considers divorce. Talks planned to resolve issues. AITA?,"My wife told me to shut my mouth in front of everyone at a kid’s birthday party.

My wife told me to shut my mouth in front of everyone at a kid’s birthday party. My wife and I are at odds lately over her sister in law who is also her best friend, who is married to her brother. Long story short, she bends over backwards to accommodate their every ask, including babysitting, errands etc. This extends to volunteering me to help them without my knowledge or consent etc. She never sees my point of view or agrees with any criticism of them I have. We were at my nephew's birthday party today. My sister in law is the one who's hosting it, so my wife is super keen for things to go well. Things were going ok, my daughter was a bit upset because her balloon animal had accidentally been popped. So she's standing with my wife getting a cuddle, and a boy sprints into her and knocks her over. She's crying obviously, and I pick her up. My wife is making a joke of it saying ""oh she needs to watch where she's going"". I said back to her ""don't blame her for getting bowled over by the bigger boy"". Now, apparently the mother of this other kid was in earshot, which prompted my wife to tell me in front of one of her other best friends and a couple of other guests to ""Shut my mouth."" Then she had the cheek to tell me to not have a moody face. I got home and sent a consultation to a divorce lawyer. Edit: I spoke to my solicitor first thing this morning, and we had a good talk. He knows that I'm angry and upset at the situation, and he says that he will get myself and my wife in for a consultation if we decide to go down that route. The issue in Scotland is that for a divorce where only one party wants out, it can take upwards of a year to get it unless both parties agree to unreasonable behaviour as the reason for the courts granting the divorce. Long story short, I can't proceed without her buy in if I want it resolved fast. So I took my daughter to my mum's after this, and then sat my wife down. I told her that yesterday's situation was absolutely unacceptable, and that if I had told her to shut her mouth in front of my friends, that I'd be getting crucified from everyone we know. I told her she was lucky I ""kept my mouth shut"" at the party , and that I didn't give a crap about how Sister in law would have taken it. We fought again about sister in law, and again, she defended her actions, saying that I'm the selfish one who won’t help out my family when they need it. I then did the move of dropping divorce leaflets I'd printed from my solicitors website in front of her. I said to her ""I absolutely want to help my family, and this is how I do it."" I told her about how I was tired of playing third wheel in my own marriage, and I told her that I was not prepared to subject my daughter to a lifetime of this subservience. Finally, it looks like what I've said has had an impact. She cried and I think she was close to having a panic attack. This made me feel guilty, because fundamentally I don't think she's a bad person, she's just brainwashed into thinking her sister in law is the second coming of the Messiah. So she promised that when I've finished work today we can have a serious talk about things, and she will listen to my concerns. Right now I'm not buying it, but I owe her and my daughter at least a chance to sort things out. So I'll see where it goes."

","Let's See If You Like A Taste Of Your Own Medicine

There is a faculty member (let's call her Lola) who is beyond annoying. What makes her so annoying? Well, she tended to make everybody wait for her. It didn’t help that she was the one responsible for supplying us with what we needed in our classroom. For example, when you try to get her to do anything or answer a question, she would always say “Oh, give me a moment. I’m so busy” and never gets back to us. Sounds like nothing, right? Well, when you approach her again, Lola responds with the same response. Eventually, you would get so fed up with waiting for her that you would just figure out the solution on your own only for her to complain that you should have waited for her. And, when you tell her that we got tired of chasing her, Lola would always counter with “I’m just so busy. You must be patient with me.” This had been going on for about a few weeks now but I mostly ignored her; I'm self-efficient and usually buy my own things. That was until she got involved in our Starbucks run. Every time we planned a Starbucks run, the process was always the same: we post it in the group, everybody puts down their order, and our boss collects and pays. But, every time, Lola would say “Wait, I’m so busy” only to not order anything an hour later. She did this a few more times until I announced that I had enough. My colleagues wanted to know what I was going to do and I told them that I got an idea. So, on Monday, I started taking orders. She did her usual antics and I told her that she got ten minutes. She tried to object saying that she was so busy but I stood my ground. Ten minutes later, I ordered. Thirty minutes later, we got our order, and she was fuming. She tried to protest but I told her that I meant what I said. Then, she said that I should have waited for her. For the whole week, every time she tried to talk to me, I would just give her usual response (“I’m busy”, “Oh, give me a moment”, and things like that). And I do mean every time. Soon, it got to the point where she refused to talk to me which was fine because, again, I'm self-reliant. Now, here’s where the real fun begins. My colleagues started to join in on it, which started to piss her off even more. Nobody wanted to let up even after being spoken to about it. We all just informed her that we're just doing what she's done to us. Then, today, the students got involved. I don’t know if they saw what we did or heard about it. All I know is that they started to do it, too, and, being teenagers, they were relentless. Even when she said “Hi” to them, they gave Lola her usual responses. After dealing with this for a week, she finally broke down and cried. I got called into a meeting with my boss after Lola singled me out. He told me that what I did was cruel and requested that I tried to make amends with her. I refused and countered that she needs to grow up and stop acting like she is more important than she actually is. "
"  wife endures mistreatment, exposes husband's illegal activities to his company's rival, bankrupting him and securing her freedom.","What’s the sweetest revenge you’ve ever witnessed?

There is actually a TV show that is about real life couples who want a divorce and their reason for wanting a divorce. The couples fight in court because usually one person wants a divorce while the other one doesn't. This one particular story about a couple will always be imbedded in my head because of how epic it was. The beginning of the episode started off with the husband treating the wife like absolute crap because according to him she was too naggy and ugly and whatever other reason he had. They had one daughter together, and he gave her shit for that too because he wanted a son. Then one day, he Brings home his mistress (who, by the way, is considerably younger than both of them) because she was pregnant with his child and has the audacity to tell his wife that she's living with them from now on. He kicks his wife out of their bedroom and she's stuck sleeping on the couch and he adores and treats his mistress like a princess because she's pregnant with a boy, like he always wanted. He orders his wife around like a maid and she basically is a maid for the mistress. The wife didn't want a divorce because she was extremely poor with a daughter, and she didn't have a job money or a place to live if she left him. It is important to note that the husband is very wealthy from his business. Then one day, the husband started to physically mistreat the wife and that was when she decided she had enough. She sought out her husband's company's biggest rival group and asked to talk to the CEO of the company. She made a deal with the CEO telling him that she would leak all of her husband's illegal trades as well as business secrets and partners in exchange for a huge amount of money. He agreed, and the wife earned a shit ton of money while her husband lost his company, ended up completely broke AND in debt (with a kid on the way too). He kept begging her to stay and ""work things out together"" and she was like lol nope and wanted a divorce immediately. She ended up getting what little he had - house, car, land property. All in all, I'd say it went down very very well."
"  towering height led to excruciating chest pain for a fifth-grader, caused by a punctured lung and nerve involvement.","What’s the worst physical pain you’ve experienced?

I'm a tall guy. 6 foot 7. Back in 5th grade, one night while I was getting ready for bed, I started to get some pain in my chest. I went out to the living room and just tried to relax, but it was really nagging at me and starting to get stronger. Naturally, my mom came out to complain that I wasn't in bed yet, so I told her that something wasn't right. She went to conference with my dad about what they should do. At first, my dad didn't want to take me to the emergency room, but that question was answered when I started screaming. My parents rushed me to the car and blew every red light in NYC to get me to the emergency room. At this point I was writing in pain and screaming at five second intervals, I couldn't tell them or the triage doctors anything but my chest hurt. I was rushed to the front of the line and into an x-ray that didn't show anything. My vitals were fine, and I had no internal bleeding. At one point I had five doctors on my case, all of them without answers. They gave me a total of three doses of morphine  to stop the screaming. Four hours later my pain was gone and I was allowed to go home. It was three days later before my general practitioner figured out what had been wrong. He spotted a small dot on the x-ray that had been taken that night, on my lung just above my bronchial tube. Turns out that my bronchial tubes had grown as though I was a normal sized, stockier kid, and my lungs had grown long and thin like my body. My left bronchial tube punctured my lung and air started to leak between the lung and this sort of protective sac that surrounds it. This leak slowly tore the lining from my lung, like having skin being slowly torn off. Worse, it happened right beneath a ""non-localized"" nerve cluster, so not only was the pain amplified, I felt it across my entire chest."
"  an eccentric guest went beyond boundaries by becoming a neighborhood weed dealer, bleeding everywhere, and engaging in inappropriate behavior.","What was the Worst thing a guest did when they took ""Make yourself at home"" too literally?

Our good friend and her boyfriend came to stay with my fiancee and I for a week. Our friend was a saint, her boyfriend was a literal goblin. To this day I have no idea how this man survived into his 20s, he was the absolute strangest person I've ever met. Very friendly, but very strange. We'll call him Sven.
He was fine for the first couple of days. Took us all out for drinks, acted like a total gentleman. A couple of days in, he decides he wants to be a weed dealer in our neighborhood. For reference, we lived in a residential family neighborhood in ""the hood"" of our city. There were already several dealers on our block. We tried to convince him this was a very bad idea, specifically because we didn't want the other dealers on our block thinking our house was the competition. Sven did not listen. Fortunately nothing serious happened and he didn't run into anyone important. He did, however run into our next door neighbor, and invited himself into the guy's house.
Now, at this point Sven texted his girlfriend saying he was at the neighbor's house just hanging out (our neighbor was a nice dude, but not someone we've ever actually hung out with), so we begin the process of trying to extract him. He's not picking up on it because he has no understanding of social cues whatsoever. Suddenly Sven stands up and exclaims ""Aw shit I'm bleeding!"" His shin was bleeding a lot, he had apparently picked a scab. Our neighbor asked him if he wanted a bandaid, and Sven just said ""nah man I can handle it"". We eventually got him out, but not before he bled all over the place.
The next morning my fiancee gets up before the sunrise to use the bathroom and sees Sven in the back yard jerking off with his pants down. She decided not to confront him because it was weird. We later asked his girlfriend about it and offered to leave if they wanted to have s x, and apparently he believed it was rude to have s x in someone else's house and thought it would be polite to jerk off in the yard. Again, residential family neighborhood. No idea what possessed him to think this was okay.
Sven had a condition where every time he was cold he would grab at his stomach and make audible ""uhhh...brrrr"" sounds, and complain that his stomach hurt. We couldn't figure out what that had to do with being cold.
At one point Sven bought a gallon of milk and a can of chili, rapidly ate the chili and chugged the milk, and then projectile vomited all over the backyard. When we asked his girlfriend why he didn't just use the toilet, she said he'd told her he ""wanted to be polite"". I asked him about the vomit later on and he just said ""uhh...ate too fast"" and left it at that.
There were some other things that weren't exceptionally noteworthy but were still annoying. He'd sleep in our living room all day and fart a lot. He'd take hour long showers and use up all of our hot water, shampoo, and conditioner.
On the day they're supposed to leave I decide I've had enough and I'm burned out, so I get in my car and start driving to the local CVS on my street to pick up a few things and get out of the house. Lo and behold, Sven hops our fence, slides in my passenger door, and says he needs a couple things for the trip so he'd be coming with me. When we get there he's just being loud and yelling across the store trying to have conversations with me, and at this point I'm just counting down the minutes until he leaves.
We get to the checkout line, he cuts in front of me, and before the cashier even starts ringing him up he starts asking for discounts. I believe he asked for the “out of towners discount” and also tried to apply for a credit card. At a CVS. When this doesn't work and his stuff comes out to more than he wanted it to, he said ""aw shit...hey man can you get me this drink, I thought I'd be able to get some discounts"". I reluctantly add his drink to my basket because I don't want to deal with the hassle. He looks in my basket, which contains shampoo and conditioner to replace the ones he used up, and says ""damn dude, you go through a lot of Suave for a bald guy"". No words."
"  rejected guy's extreme reaction: Email with suicide attempt, threats, harassment. Years later, contacts recipient before wedding. Psychotic and dangerous.




","Girls who have rejected a guy, what’s the WORST way someone has taken it?

He sent me an email with a 3 page essay attached. It was written entirely in 3rd person recounting his first rejection by a girl named Tania at the age of 16. There were a lot of solitary beach walks, 'she's the perfect girl' talk, him not talking no for answer and the story eventually ends with him drinking anti-freeze, slipping into a coma, hospitalised and eventually recuperating. Only to tell poor Tania that she could avoided his, and his parents pain by agreeing to date him. The email said ""so you know what you are getting into""
I was 19 and did not see this extreme level of crazy coming but knew I needed to really make how I felt clear. I immediately called him to reiterate that I do not want to be with him, I no longer want to be friends with him and if he contacted me again I would change my number. I let a friend of his know what was going on. 5 days later he called from a different number to tell me he was out in the country one with a gun to his head and if I didn't agree to be with him then an there he was pulling the trigger. I lied and convinced him I had to leave because I had a family emergency (aunt sick in the hospital) but we would talk the next day. Had mutual friend call him and report back as is suspected he was full of shit. Sure enough I was right, he was totally fine.
He called the next day and with the most sing song creepy serial killer tone said ""you think you're so niiiiiice. What type of shitty human being doesn't agree to what someone needs when they tell you they're going to kill themselves? You piece of shiiiiit."" I. Lost. The. Plot. Told him I'm changing my numbers, and the next time he contacts me it will be the police involved. He just laughed the whole time and told me he hopes I die alone, like I deserve.

"  Chinese immigrants discover media censorship after leaving China, leading to shock and conflicting feelings about their homeland's perception.","Immigrants from china, what was a piece of media you didnt know was censored until you left china?

Chinese immigrant here. My family has political ties so I heard more propaganda than usual. What surprised me the most was that people outside China seem to hate/dislike China so much.
Inside the country, the focus of our education was less about censorship but more about propaganda aka China is BEST PLACE EVER. All 5000+ years of beautiful art and heroes etc. That’s why so many Chinese people will defend China so passionately, and ignore any contradictory facts. No need for censorship because people were already non-receptive to any bad things said about their dear motherland.
Anyway that’s why it’s extra shocking to hear people hate on a place that felt like the BEST. Even knowing all the facts now, most Chinese people will only appear to be ‘enlightened’, to fit in = not make trouble or cause people to judge them. Secretly they remain loyal to China. It’s like this: imagine if you had a great childhood (subjectively) and your mom loved you and you loved her. Then imagine some strangers present ‘concrete evidence’ that your mom is a terrible person and did terrible things. Can you hate her? Agree with the strangers? Just toss away all the good memories?"
"  woman receives email from ex-husband who cheated with her sister, reminiscing about their past and seeking reconciliation.","My ex-husband who cheated on me with my sister emailed me after 6 years

My ex-husband who cheated on me with my sister emailed me after 6 years. I met my ex-husband (Dan) almost 15 years ago at a restaurant when I was celebrating my 18th birthday. He was really nice, charming and mature. He made me feel loved and special. For some context, I grew up in a dysfunctional family. My mom and dad used to always fight. My dad would sometimes go out and not come back for months. He died when my sister Abby was born. My mom was way too fond of Abby since her birth rather than me. Abby was basically babied by my mother. She didn't neglect me at all, always did her best as a mother and provided for me but I always felt something was missing. After Dan came into my life, I didn't feel like there was something missing from me. He supported me and was caring. He would always buy me gifts and take me out on long drives. I felt complete when I was with him. We got married after dating for 4 years. I wanted to start a family right away but Dan encouraged me to do my masters and helped me build my career. He wanted us to be in a stable position financially before we start thinking about having kids. Seriously, he was the best guy I could ever ask for. After 5 years of being happily married, I discovered that my husband was cheating on me with Abby. I discovered the affair when my husband made an excuse that he will go out of town for a week but he stayed in town and he booked a hotel room where he and Abby can get freaky in the sheets. This has been going on for 6 months behind my back. I was really devastated. Abby and I were close growing up. I loved her and cared for her. How could she do this to me? After D-Day, Dan and I had a fight. I asked how he could do this to me? That too with my sister who just turned 19? He said that he didn't love me anymore, that I didn't give him enough attention and that I am not the same girl he fell in love with. Between this mess, I discovered that I was pregnant. But due to the stress, I lost the baby. He didn't even care enough to visit me at the hospital when I lost our child. He was having a weekend getaway with my sister. I should have seen the signs. Abby would always be touchy with Dan. Dan would sometimes stare at her. But it is still very disturbing for me. My mother as usual took Abby's side and told me to just make peace with it. I wanted to off myself because I had no one left. I lost my child and my husband, my whole family. Then, my best friend Tina came to my rescue. She was moving to another state and asked me to come with her. I said yes. I was already divorced at that point and we lived in a small town. So, I would obviously run into my ex and my sister. It took me a while to settle into my new life in a different state but I met some kind people there. It helped me heal some trauma. I still have trust issues. I met my now husband Tony after one year of moving to the new place. I was really hesitant and kept my guard up but he showed me that he is trustworthy and loves me a lot. I was so happy with him that I almost forgot about the life I had back in my hometown. His parents were really welcoming and generous people. We got married a year ago. I am now pregnant with our first child. Yesterday, I got an email from my ex Dan. It just brought back all the bad memories. I am just paraphrasing his email. He mentioned that he misses me. He tried to find me but couldn't. He is very miserable with my sister. She is very dumb and doesn't care about him like I do. I used to bake him a cake and throw birthdays for him. But Abby only texted him Happy birthday and didn't even bother to buy him a cake. Plus she is very rude, she doesn't respect him, she is always at the bar with her friends. He also mentioned that she has cheated on him 5 times already. The last affair was with his cousin. Our mother also doesn't stop her. He will soon file for a divorce but lately he has been missing me a lot. He wants us to try again as a couple. He wants us to become a family just like before. Since I do not have social media except for instagram which is private, he probably doesn't know that I am married and I have a baby on the way. I don't know if I should feel pity for him or just laugh because the grass on his side is very brown rather than green."
"  fiancé wants open relationship, plans to leave for coworker. Heartbroken person discovers betrayal through text messages. Devastated and seeking support.","My fiancé is planning on leaving me to be in an open relationship with his co-worker.

I had been with my fiancé for 4 years and he proposed to me on my birthday last year. I always thought our relationship was great and that we were unstoppable but I guess that was wrong. Usually, he has always let me use his phone (games or because my phone would be screwed up). Recently, he was being very distant and even getting upset if I asked for his phone. We’re always open about our phones and if the other would like to be sure if we haven’t been disloyal, we were both okay with it. I shrugged it off as maybe he’s planning something for my birthday since it’s coming up. A couple days ago, he asked me if we could try opening up the relationship. This took me by surprise because he’s never been the type to get physical or emotional with anyone else but me. I told him that I’m uncomfortable with the thought of that and he kept explaining how it could build us up emotionally to see other people’s perspectives on how we can improve our love. I continued telling him no and saying that it doesn’t feel right. I never wanted to be with anyone else but him. He has been trying to convince me for the past day but I didn’t budge. He ended up saying “whatever” and going on a walk for a couple hours. When he left, I cried my eyes out because it made me think he wasn’t being loyal. Unlucky for him, he had left his phone on the counter in the kitchen so I took it upon myself to check. To my horror, I saw my worst nightmare. He was messaging a co-worker, we’ll call her Kim, for a couple weeks. Messages saying “I love you” and “Let’s plan a little date together”. I cried and continued reading, I saw that they were trying to plan a way to leave me or get an open relationship started. Seeing as though the open relationship plan failed, they started saying that he should leave me and they can be in an open relationship. I’m so hurt and distraught by this. I thought he would be with me through thick and thin. Not to mention, I have a daughter (6) that has absolutely loved him and thought of him as her dad. I’m crushed and betrayed for both me and my daughter. She was going to be our flower girl and have the prettiest dress and now I have to tell her everything. My worst nightmare is coming to fruition and I can’t stop crying. I’m trying to be strong for her but it’s so hard. As I type this, I’m watching my daughter play with her dolls while watching tv and my fiancé is upstairs playing a game. For now, I’m thinking of my next steps and staying strong for my girl. Edit: I know it’s only been a couple hours but thank you everyone for your support so far. I’m taking everyone’s advice and I do plan on leaving. I’m going to come up with a plan to put all of his stuff out while he’s working one day and completely cut him out. Also, a couple questions I’ve seen that I should clarify on. With his messages, he had asked me a couple days ago to open the relationship and I told him no. I should’ve clarified that for the past day he had been nonstop pestering me over opening the relationship. My fault, at the time of writing I was so distraught. After asking me the first time he told Kim what my answer was and Kim had said “You should just leave at this point (etc etc)”. But he thought it was best to keep trying to convince me. Like I said that was my bad, it was mostly Kim saying that he should leave. Also, some people may be confused at him leaving his phone while he was away. We live in a wide open rural area and usually when he needs to blow off steam, he goes through the backyard and to the woods that’s a little down the yard. I never had a need to check his phone but I trusted him at that time. He usually left to “blow off steam” or something. Again I’m so sorry for any confusion during my distraught time of writing this. And thank you again."
"  student teacher fixed a student's spelling test to secure a class pizza party, aiming to protect the student from embarrassment.","I, a student teacher, secretly corrected my student's spelling test so the class can get a pizza party

I started student teaching in a 4th-grade special ed class in September. My teacher told her students that if all 12 of them get 100% on their spelling tests, we can have a pizza party. So far, that has not happened yet. This past Monday, my teacher told them “This is Ms. K’s last week with us. Let’s all work really hard to finally get that pizza party.” The kids were really excited. During their free time, they would all study their words. I never saw them work so hard.
What makes this situation difficult is the bullying between Gabby and Sam. Sam has severe dyslexia and struggles with spelling. Gabby constantly picks on Sam for it. My teacher and school take this seriously and intervenes. However, Gabby still picks on Sam.
After my teacher said “Let’s all work really hard to finally get that pizza party,” Gabby shouted back “Can you make sure that Sam studies since she’s really bad at spelling?” We addressed this with Gabby. Even though she is only 9, she pisses me off with her passive-aggressive comments. Sam practiced really hard for the spelling test. I even stayed after school Thursday to help Sam study.
On Friday morning right before the test, she was crying because she didn’t want to be the only student to fail and ruin the pizza party. I told her that she worked so hard this past week and she is smart.
For the spelling test, our teacher will say the spelling word out loud and the students will write it. 11 of the students have the same words. Sam has a slightly different set of words which are a bit easier. My teacher whispers Sam’s words to her. When the teacher does this, Gabby will sometimes snicker. I can’t FLIPPING stand this. We addressed this before, but Gabby still doesn’t change her behavior.
I finally lost it. This past Friday, Gabby snickered again. I went up to Gabby and angrily whispered “I will take your test and fail you right now if you don’t stop. And you will ruin the pizza party for everyone. Stop it.” She started crying in her seat. I didn’t care. Maybe it will finally get through to Gabby.
Once the kids are done, I walk around and collect all the tests. The kids go to lunch, and my teacher gives me the tests to grade. She leaves for lunch duty. I start grading each test and it's 100% after 100%. I am so proud of my students. I get to Gabby’s test and it's 100%. I finish grading and every single test is 100%. I feel so proud and excited for them. But then I realize, I only collected 11 tests. Sam’s test is on my teacher’s desk.
I go through her test and she is spelling all the words correctly. I never felt so proud. But then, it hits me. The very last word which is always a “challenge word"" is spelled wrong. She wrote “because” as “becuase”. I am still proud of her because she got 9/10 correct. She never scored that high before. And sight words are very challenging. But all the students will figure out that Sam “ruined” the pizza party for them. Even if we don’t announce who failed, they will figure it out.
I could talk to my teacher about letting them have the pizza party anyway- but my teacher is a stickler for the rules. “Everyone needs to get a 100%.” I can’t let Sam feel like a failure or get bullied. So, I erased the “u” and the “a” and switched them. Sam probably won’t notice. And I won’t tell Sam or she will feel bad. She will eventually learn how to spell ""because"". I need her to have her moment.
The kids came back from recess and were told the good news. They were so excited. Sam was so proud of herself! I came back on Monday for the pizza party!"
"  a person has pretended to be Jewish for 20 years, starting as a joke, but it spiraled out of control.","I’ve lied to everyone in my life for 20 years that I’m Jewish...

I’ve lied to everyone in my life for 20 years that I’m Jewish... I’m not jewish, not even a little bit. If you asked me any questions about Judaism, I couldn’t tell you, but still, everyone thinks I’m jewish. It all started in high school, 11th grade. I had just moved from California to The South and it was a rough time. I was called every horrible name in the book because I talked different and got the SH*T beat out of me multiple times. Well I slowly befriended some of the guys on the football team and my closest friend was the center, we’ll call him Greg. Now Greg is a super chill guy compared to everyone around him, but he’s still very very racist and very open about all his opinions. Well one day I’m driving Greg and a few other football players home from school and he makes a comment about synagogues. Without even thinking, I mention that I’ve been to one... and this is where it all started. This prompted one of the other guys to joke that I was a Jew, and trying to be chill (since these were the only friends I had) I went “haha, yep, I’m jewish.” And then that’s when it all went down hill. Greg told everyone on the football team how his new friend from California was a Jew, and they all believed it since most of them thought there were only Jews in California anyways. And the football players spread that to the rest of the school. At this point, I still thought it was a joke and everyone was just jokingly calling me jewish, so I just kept going with it. Then I became known as “The Jewish kid” and started to actually become popular, since everyone wanted to be friends with the different kid, (and the fact my dad had money, a lot compared to the poor area I went to school, so I could afford to buy nice things and people tend to be attracted towards that). And so being Jewish almost became my identity, it became who I was. So whenever someone would ask my religion, I just automatically told them I was jewish. Fast forward to the end of high school, and the councilors are walking people through scholarship stuff, and my councilor calls me into his office and hands me a slip for a $5,000 Jewish American scholarship. Now as soon as I read jewish American scholarship, I was going to walk out and throw it out, but he made me sit down and fill it out with him, and then took it from me to submit it. I felt horrible for even doing it, but somewhat relieved when I heard that they only gave it to people who were also ethnically jewish, so I knew I wouldn’t get it. I got it. I received a letter in the mail saying I was chosen as the winner of this $5000 scholarship. I got accepted to Dartmouth due to the fact I worked my ass off in high school and was the valedictorian, though my competition wasn’t plentiful to say the least. But I never thought I would have been able to afford it, but this scholarship was huge in helping me towards that. I considered spilling everything then, declining the scholarship, telling everyone at school, telling almost every single form I’ve filled out, saying I’m not actually jewish... I decided to tell my dad and ask him for advice as he’s always been a guy you can talk to about anything whatsoever."
"  unfortunate string of incidents, including injuries and hearing loss, taking a toll on a teenage girl's physical and emotional well-being.","My daughter has the WORST luck of ALL TIME

My daughter has the WORST luck of ALL TIME.
(16F) had a terrible 2022 from a physical standpoint. Last January she broke three fingers after her brother (13M) accidentally closed a car door on her hand. In June we were at a wedding and she sprained her right knee after someone pushed her and her heel got stuck in-between an opening of a pedestrian bridge and in July she broke the same three fingers again after getting her hand stuck in the bathroom door. Those three incidents are bad but manageable. September is where she had really bad luck. My daughter is partially deaf. She developed an ear infection when she was 2 months old and it resulted in loss of hearing in 80% of her left ear and 30% in her right ear. She’s worn a hearing aid her whole life and is understandably a little self conscious of it at times. We were afraid she would lose more of her hearing and it unfortunately happened. The same infection my daughter had as a toddler returned in July and she ended up losing most of her hearing in her left ear by September. The doctor said she will most likely lose all hearing in her ear by January. My daughter is a strong person but she was a little emotional when she found out. Thankfully, her health insurance covers 75% of the costs of a cochlear implant so she is in line to get one. THE VERY NEXT DAY AFTER SHE FOUND OUT SHE IS DEAF IN ONE EAR, SHE TEARS HER ACL AND MCL LIGAMENTS. She plays volleyball for her high school and one of her teammates fell into her knee and tore it up. She had surgery the next week and her recovery has been going well but my wife and I have noticed a change in her. She has been a lot more quiet since tearing her ACL and has been a lot more irritable. She had purple highlights but dyed her hair back to all black and stayed in her room all day. On Friday, my daughter might have reached her breaking point. We went to the doctors to get a check-up for her ears and they told us her surgery to get a cochlear implant was postponed until may. This the fourth time her surgery has been pushed back and we are starting to lose patience. She has told me how difficult it’s been for her to hear in class and she feels like an outsider because she can’t hear what her friends are talking about. She has her hearing aid but it’s been giving all sorts of problems recently so she barely uses it outside of class. My daughter did not say anything and walked out of the room and out the hospital door. She wasn’t waiting by the car when I walked out of the hospital but I saw her sitting on a nearby bench. It was raining so I ran and got her back in the car. I asked her if she was okay but she didn’t respond and was quiet the whole ride home. As I pulled into the driveway I heard some sniffling so I turned to my daughter and she was starting to cry. I asked her again if she was okay but she told me not to look at her and ran into the house and locked herself in her bedroom and I have barely seen her since Friday. She stayed in her room all weekend and only left to use the restroom and get some to eat early in the morning and late at night so we didn't see her. My wife and I are worried about her. She wasn’t able to play volleyball which we know had a big impact on her but more importantly she’s taking her hearing loss extremely hard. Outside of class she can barely hear us speaking and her tone of voice is becoming higher to compensate for her deafness which is causing to talk even less than she normally does. I have heard crying from her room multiple times this weekend but my wife and I will be yelled at to go away if we knock on her door. I’ll try to have a conversation with her tomorrow but I’m deeply worried about her mental state."
"  friend's husband falsely accused her of having a crush, causing issues with her fiance. Seeks help in resolving the situation.","I learned a hard lesson about herself

My best friend Sarah and her husband Matt have put me in a very difficult position with my fiance Jack. I knew Matt since my childhood, he was my neighbor and we were friendly. Sarah and I were roommates in college and became close friends. When I introduced Sarah and Matt, they hit it off and started dating each other. I was happy to see two of my friends get together but also annoyed that I became the third wheel and was often ignored or set aside because they were so into each other. By the time I graduated, Matt had completely dropped me as a friend. That saddened me but I was still good friends with Sarah so it was what it was. Sarah and I would frequently hang out, but I never talked with Matt other than the occasional polite hellos. Sarah would sometimes try to do couples dates with her and Matt and me and my dates. I found that Matt had developed an unpleasant personality and would frequently be rude and condescending towards me. However, he’s a very devoted and loving husband to Sarah so for her sake I ignored him. When my fiance and I got engaged, we had no plans to do a party. Sarah was disappointed that we didn’t throw an engagement party so she organised a small get together at her home to celebrate with us. The party was nice and as things were winding down, my fiance and I went to thank Sarah and Matt for their sweet gesture before we took our leave. Matt was pretty tipsy by then and out of nowhere he suddenly hugged me and in front of my fiance said that he was so glad that I was finally settling down and he is relieved that now I’ll be over the crush I had on him. I was shocked and told him that wasn’t true. He just laughed and told Jack that I was always chasing him and he had to work hard to keep me away. I dragged Sarah in and asked her to please fix this mess and she was all like oh he’s drunk, ignore him and say, you know I always trust you, I know you wouldn’t act on your crush. Jack was pretty mad by this point and he walked out. I ran after him and tried explaining that this isn’t true but he told me he doesn’t want to be anyone’s second choice or their backup plan. Since that night he hasn't talked to me or returned my calls. I have talked to Sarah multiple times to clear things with Jack but she’s brushing me off. I don’t understand why they believe this or why she’d stay friends with me if she thought I was into her husband. I was at her wedding party and did all the work because her sister who was the maid of honour was too busy. I have helped her through her pregnancy and have babysat her kid so many times. She never gave me any indication she thought this and why would she want me close to her family if she believed this? I feel humiliated that these people think I was pining away for a jerk like Matt. I need help in convincing Jack this isn’t true."
"  a designer refuses to copy a dress for spoiled cousin's wedding, upsetting the family tradition and her parents.","AITA for ruining my family's tradition because she’s a spoiled brat.
As a family tradition I have designed all the wedding dresses for any of my family members. When my eldest sister got engaged she asked me to design her dress since I'm passionate about design and she’s always loved my style. Her dress was a knockout, everyone loved it and ever since whenever one of our relatives announces their engagement they ask if I can design their dress for them. I've always said yes because I absolutely love designing dresses. My cousin is getting married next February and called me up to see when we could meet so she could share her ideas for her dress and I can start designing it. I do not like this cousin at all, her parents spoiled her beyond rotten. I decided to still meet with her though and see if anything has changed since she's now an adult. She immediately shows me some photos of wedding dresses by Sara Burton and tells me she wants something exactly like the pictures, I try to suggest a change in neckline or color and she shuts it down and tells me she wants exactly that. I told her I would not be making her dress as I love designing clothes that embody their wearer and suit them, not rip off others designers so she can look fancy in a knock off. Some of my family and especially her and her parents are beyond upset and have been blowing up my phone because I've ""broken tradition and my baby cousins heart because she's been looking forward to having me make her wedding dress for years now"" I feel kind of bad but at the same time she's taking the fun and bonding out of designing a wedding dress.

How did your marriage fail? I had a career ending accident at work that left my left arm and much of my left side parallelized ( high voltage electrocution). The doctors said they could not predict how much I would recover. My wife and I were in our fifties married for twenty years. To her credit she cared for me until I was mostly able to care for myself. I could fix my own meals, dress myself etc.. After six months she set me down and said she still had a lot of living to do and didn’t want to spend the rest of her life caring for an invalid. She had been having an affair with a bachelor neighbor as a means of coping and he invited her to take a vacation together. and she was going. While she was gone I sorted my possessions as best I could and moved them into an RV we owned. I found an RV park I liked and some friends helped me to move. Now seven years later my left side is better though weak, I moved to be near my son and his family, I’ve started a new career doing voice overs, narrations and talking books.

"  a patient man, ex-SAS, who calmly handles disrespectful troublemakers in a pub, leaving them beaten outside.




","What happened that time you saw the fury of a patient man?

Me and a few of my friends used to frequent a pub in my home town.
It was a small place in the town centre, a traditional English pub, complete with attractive barmaid and consistent regulars, us included.
Every time we were in there, a guy would be sat at the bar, on his own, with a half of bitter. He'd occasionally join the banter, but was never loud or drunk. He was a nice bloke, always said hello and smiled. We knew him only as Ray.
Now Ray was about 60, but fit, not big, just a normal looking guy, a few forearm tattoos, pretty standard for the north of England in the 90s.
One Saturday afternoon, me and 4 of my friends were having our usual couple of drinks, as it was Saturday there was a football match on. 3 ""away"" fans walk into the pub, already a brave move, but this is a friendly place, everyone eyes them suspiciously but carries on drinking.
They walk to the bar and immediately start being horrible to the barmaid. Making lewd comments, complaining loudly about the beer etc.
Ray looks at these 3 guys and says ""No need to be rude boys, she's here to do a job"".
Queue a stream of verbal abuse from the away fans, ""Shut the f up grandad, what you gonna do about it?"" etc.
The regulars are having none of this, everyone, me included, stands up and stares at these idiots.
Ray turns to everyone and just says ""Sit down lads, I'll deal with this."" turns to the away fans, ""You 3, outside, now.""
These 3 guys, obviously there for a fight anyway, are all "" come on then grandad, let's go"".
They all walk out of the bar, and not 20 seconds later, Ray walks back in, without a word, sits back on his stool and sips his half of bitter.
Curiosity got the better of us so we all ran outside, to see complete carnage. Two guys out cold on the pavement, one on his backside with blood pouring out of his nose.
It turns out that Ray was ex SAS. And the barmaid was his daughter.

"  persistent ex used tactics like prolonged denial, false accusations, and relentless contact to win them back, causing a tumultuous relationship.","What’s the Craziest thing an ex said to try and win you back?

When I first tried to break up with her she just kept saying ""no"" until I gave in. She said no for more than 10 minutes. The second time I tried to break up with her she pulled the same trick, but this time ready for it I beat her at her own game and said yes in response. When I got bored of this back and forth, I said ""well it's a yes, so I'm sorry. Good bye."" She then messaged my brother and sister-in-law (whom she had never met), telling them that I needed to call her back right away because she was unstable and didn't know what she was capable of. When my brother told me that I told him to ignore her. She continued to message them saying everything from she was pregnant to ""she deserves better, she deserves me."" After 24 hours of relentlessly contacting my family, a family of 7 total, I turned my phone back on and saw I had 150 texts and 19 voicemails from her. As an aside, this is where I learned an iMessage can only be so long, when it exceeds the maximum character count you have to press on the message and it is opened up on the notes app. When I called her back, she immediately started yelling at me saying things like how dare I, who do you think you are, she deserves better. I told her I would hang up and block her every where I could if she didn't stop yelling at me, I called to have a conversation about why I wanted to break up with her so she could get some closure. She calmed down and in the coolest tone I've ever heard her speak, she told me that she would tell her dad that I was physically and verbally abusive to her if I didn't get back together with her. Her dad was not a particularly big or scary guy, but he works with my dad where I also work and it would have been a career-ender for me if they had believed her. I decided to roll the dice and tell her that her dad knows she has mental issues and there is no way he would believe her. I knew her dad before I knew her so I was 25% confident he would take my side (she did have mental issues). For whatever reason, she believed me and went back to crying and yelling at me. I said good bye, please don't contact me again. After 6 more months of repeated attempts to contact me, I found out she got engaged to some poor guy. I don't know how, who, why, or when it happened but I was happy it was finally over for me. Unfortunately, I was wrong. She will still follow and unfollow my girlfriend and her dogs Instagram account as well as like and unlike 2+ year old pictures on their accounts. She is now married, as of a few months ago, and is still pulling this shit every once in a while. If she wasn't so messed up or if I didn't respect her dad so much I would have contacted the guy she married and told him, but at the end of the day it's just not worth it. I may have handled it poorly, but she was a complete nightmare to date. She had crazy mood swings, would yell at me in front of my family and friends, was incredibly bossy, and we had nothing in common. Only a crazy person would think the relationship was going somewhere."
"  kindergarten teacher recalls student's desperate need to be first, resulting in entertaining outbursts and a comical punishment threat.




","Teachers of reddit, what’s the funniest thing you’ve heard a student say that you unfortunately had to punish them for?

Kindergarten teacher here. I had a boy who was an only child and did not understand why he wasn't always 1st at school. Would throw himself on the floor and have a screaming fit if he wasn't first in line, first to get whatever I was passing out (even work), first to be called on when I asked a question... and so on. If I ever said that someone was doing well, did a great job on the assignment or was being a good friend I would hear, ""WHAT ABOUT ME!? WHAT ABOUT ME!?"" When I would ignore him, he would freak the f out. It was pretty entertaining.
On top of all of that, this poor kid was the slowest, weakest kid ever. Wasn't a fat kid or anything, just not a physical or athletic type in any way imaginable.
His mom got pregnant when he was in my class and she was a miserable pregnant. She began to tell him no. A lot. I'm not sure if it was because she finally realized that he was a spoiled nightmare, or she was just tired of dealing with him because she realized she would soon have 2 of these running around and wanted it to stop ASAP.
Cut to one day during math... he hit another kid because the other kid opened her math book to the right page before him (remember his freak outs from not being first). I asked him to apologize and he had a screaming fit. At this point, his mom was so big (pregnant wise) that she wouldn't chase him anymore. When she would tell him no, he would hit her and run to his room and she was too tired to go after him, so he was used to not getting any kind of consequence for hitting. I wasn't going to force him to apologize, but he probably thought I was. When he told me no, I got down to his level and told him that hitting other people was not acceptable and that he would have a consequence for it. He yells, ""No!"" and hit me, then tried to run away.
Sorry, dude. No place to run. He didn't realize he didn't have a game plan and ran to a corner (very slowly, remember), so I just walked behind him and he was trapped. I took his hands with one of my hands and told him he needed to calm down so we could talk. He started screaming and jumping around. Was trying to pull his hands out from mine, but he was soooo weak. I was holding his hands together with my middle finger and thumb. Literally nothing else was touching him, but he still couldn't pull away. I just let him have his fit and instructed the rest of the kids from that corner. At this point I've been holding his hands for 10 min or so while he's been screaming and flailing.
It was about this time when he said, ""YOU BETTER LET ME GO OR IM GOING TO COUNT TO TWENTY!"" That made me giggle. Number one, you can't count past 13 because of your speech impediment and number two, what are you going to do when you get to 20? He sees my smile and he screams, ""YOU BETTER NOT SMILE AT ME RIGHT NOW! I MEAN IT! SMILING AT PEOPLE YELLING WILL GET YOU IN BIG TROUBLE!""
So I had to turn away and try not to laugh more. After 20 more minutes he calmed down, climbed in my lap, hugged me and apologized without me saying anything. He was exhausted. He had a few more fits when he didnt get to play at the end of the day (for hitting people), bit we just ignored him and he accepted his fate.
He's in high school now, but I still remember this like it was a week ago. Cracks me up every time.

I knew a guy that called a number written on a a $5 bill. He figured she must be a quality girl because it was a five and not a single. She had a great voice on the phone so they made a date. He played guitar in a popular local band, and there was a hip restaurant next to the club they were playing, so they arranged to meet before the gig. He figured they'd have dinner and then he'd impress the shit out of her with his playing (he was a truly fine guitarist). So he walked into the restaurant and looked for a girl in a pink dress. There was one, and she was enormous. So he slipped out before she saw him.
So during the show, he sees the crowd part as the girl in the pink dress makes her way to the front, where she glares at him during the entire set. Afterwards, she screamed at him for standing her up. He felt a little guilty, but he said he'd felt worse if he'd had dinner with her and then dropped her. After all this, his warning was to not call numbers you see on currency."

Anyways, there was a kid in his grade who was the biggest asshole. He was mean to everyone, even the poor kids who were his friends. He always picked on my brother and his friends, calling them retarded and everything else.
One day, we get a code red. Everyone is stuck in their class rooms and there had been a recent trend in girls fighting in the bathroom, so everyone assumed that was what was going on.
No. I wish it had been a girl fight.
I get called down to the office about an hour later. My brother and his best friend were walking to class. They were at the top of one of the stair wells when Asshole McAsshat came up behind them and shoved my brother down the stairs as hard as he could. My brother tried to grab onto the brick wall to stop himself from falling and ended up dragging his hand down the bricks, ripping his hand apart. He still has the scar. He hit his face on the tile at the bottom after doing several head over heels rolls down the stairs. His nose and lip were bleeding and his back was hurt so bad they thought he had broken it. He ended up going to the er.
Fast forward a week later. He's back in school and the principal calls him to her office. This bitch...I don't know how this bitch was ever allowed to work in a school. She made my brother SHAKE HANDS WITH ASSHOLE AND MAKE UP. She said the alternative was BOTH of them getting suspended because she did not believe my brother did nothing to provoke him from pushing him down the stairs, despite TWO witnesses telling her what happened. My brother has been bitter over that ever since.
Also, when my mom found out he had to shake Asshole McAsshats hand, she went to the school and confronted the principal. The principal told my mom, ""well maybe if your son wasn't annoying it wouldn't have happened."" My mom pulled her across the desk and a secretary had to pull her off of her.

Being assaulted and laughed at.
I'm 6 foot 4, 240 pounds and used to work as a bouncer. I tried my best not to be aggressive or anything because I know sometimes alcohol leads people into making stupid decisions. So I'd always approach everyone in a very polite, non threatening way. Usually that worked because it used to de escalate things and all.
One night, this group of girls were starting to create trouble at the club I used to work.
When I came to know what was going on and possibly calm things down like I'd ways do, one small intoxicated girl jumped me.
She was insane. Screaming, cussing, being loud and racist (I'm Latino, she was white).
I tried to calm her down but since that wasn't working, I told her I was gonna escort her out. I reached for my radio and called for back up (she was with a big group, 7 to 10 girls).
Out of nowhere, she started to barate me, trying to scratch my eyes (slashing my neck in the process), trying to kick me in the groin and crap. Other bouncers came and took her off me. Manager finally showed up.
Police were called.
When they arrived and collect statements, I came over to them saying I wanted to press changes due to the fact I was bleeding profusely in the neck and hands, they laughed at me said they ""won't waste their time"", ""nothing will come out of it"" The girls were let go by the police and went their way laughing at me. I went over to my manager, complaining he was suppose to help us or something. His response? ""man up, clean myself up and get back to work"".

","Lawyers, what was your “HOLD IT!” moment where you knew you would win?

I’m a trial lawyer. I have a ton of these.
My favorite was probably a DUI where the cop was in a Buffalo wild wings with my client watching a fight. Like, the cop was standing at the bar in full uniform, then when my client walked by him to leave, followed him out.
Client was only actually going to his car to grab his phone charger because he was going home with the bartender (like, he hadn’t even closed his tab yet). Cop arrested him and charged him with DUI for opening his car door, then fabricated this story for his report about how the client got in the car, turned it on, and began to pull out of the space to leave the parking lot. He also denied being inside the BWW - on the stand, under oath, to my face.
Surprise! I talked to the bartender at BWW and got the security tape. It very clearly (like surprisingly good quality) showed a cop standing at the bar, watching my client walk out the front door, then follow him 30 seconds later. Parking lot cam also showed the client barely touched the door handle before the cop stopped him."

About a year later after people started calling her out on her inconsistencies, she put on her Facebook that she had been feeling sick all week. She puked twice that morning and went to the hospital. And the doctor declared her cancer to be gone. She, puked up, her cancer. Of course some dummies commented on her status congratulating her for being cancer free. My comment was deleted though. Something to the effect of, really? You puked up cancer? Why the hell would you take attention away from your daughter's birthday with this crap?"

","What was the biggest plot twist in your life?

I was 19 and casually seeing a girl. Then one day I found a lump in one of my nuts while I was taking a shower. Went to the doctor and it turned out that it was can ker and that they would have to remove it. Oh and I would have to have at least 2 rounds of the most intensive chemo out there if I wanted to survive. There was also the very strong chance that I would be sterile for the rest of my life. Realising that this was something that I might not survive, I ended things and dropped off the face of the planet for the girl I was seeing, as I didn't want to end up being the dead boyfriend. She found out what was going on though and basically insisted that she be with me through it all. She came to every single 8 to 10 hour chemo session and helped me through recovery. Fast forward 6 years and we are happily married with 2 kids and our third on the way. "

","Ask me to marry you as a minor? I’ll make sure your life is ruined.Ask me to marry you as a minor? I’ll make sure your life is ruined.

 I’m 15 and this 30 year old man asked me to marry him. This happened about a year back. The apartment we lived needed electrical repairs, so an electricity company was hired and got about 30 people to come do the job. I was home with my younger brother and our maid, who was leaving soon but I convinced her to stay thankfully. Two men where ordered to fix the electricity in my room. I wasn’t comfortable with being alone with two grown men in their 30s (especially since we live in Mozambique), so I brought my dogs into the room with me. The men were terrified of my dogs and wouldn’t work near them, so I had to take them all to the backyard, but I kept the biggest dog with me just for safety. Anyway, they did their jobs. I was still a bit uncomfortable, but they where professional and there weren't many red flags besides them asking about my personal life and school. One of them was also a bit touchy and hand holdy. Once they finished the job, I escorted them out the house and then one of them decided to ask how old I was. Since there weren't too many red flags and he was otherwise very chill, I told him i was 15. He then procedes to ask me to come home with him and if I could marry him and be the mother of his future children. Mind you, this is a grown 30-year-old man. Obviously my reaction was a strong and firm no, but he asked why and insisted that he would come and pick me up the next day. He wasn’t taking no for an answer and almost grabbed me and ran if it wasn’t for him seeing my maid behind me. The coward then says goodbye to the maid and runs away as fast as possible. She comes and asks what just happened and I explain everything. She replies with “you shouldn’t tell anyone about this it will get him in trouble” and then she left to go home. Me personally? I could care less if he got in trouble. So I then called my mom about this and she was very surprised because she was on the phone with him earlier and he was a very chill dude. To my surprise, My mom is friends with the manager of the electric company that employs the guy and she told him all about what happened and asked for the dude’s phone number. The dude obviously denied everything and said I was lying, but thankfully my mom believed me and not him. That same day he was put under investigations from the city’s ethics committee. My god-father, who is a tall, scary and very influential man in our city, even went to the guy and told him that he is coming for him for what he tried to do. After the investigation, he was found in possession of illicit content of children and was jailed immediately after. Thankfully he’s locked up now. Who knows what he could’ve done to me or other girls my age if he was left out there. Eff that guy."

What’s the most depressing meal you’ve eaten?
When I was 19 after my ex left me broken and homeless, I used every penny I had left and put down a rent deposit on a run down, spider infested, cold and dirty one-room apartment. I had no furniture and was sleeping on the dusty, wooden floor on a pile of towels in below freezing temperatures, while wearing layers upon layers of clothes, gloves and a wooly hat just to keep warm (more difficult than you’d think as this was in early January in North Scotland). At that time, I was working at a fast food restaurant and received one small but free meal on my half hour break at 2am (I worked 10pm - 7am six days a week) For the first 3 weeks, I lived in this flat where a free burger was the only cooked meal I would have. On my days off I'd tend to buy anything I could afford from the local store when they reduced items to pennies at the end of the day prior to closing (usually past its sell-by date and disgusting things such as a squished bar of chocolate or mushy tomatoes). My last day off work right before I would finally be paid my crappy month's wage was the worst. I woke up at 9pm as usual and just laid in the dark on the floor. All I could think of was how hungry and helpless I was. At around 2am when I would usually get food at my work the hunger was becoming unbearable and no amount of cold water from the tap was diminishing it. I raided through all my jackets and bags still in cardboard boxes around the apartment in the hopes of finding something, anything, that could help. And that is where I found my most depressing meal. A sachet of curry sauce from the restaurant. I cried while squeezing the 25ml condiment into my mouth and crawled back onto the towels to lay there until I could go back to work 19 hours later. I am now 22 and have a house with the love of my life, who I met at the same time I moved into that apartment. Every night I come home from a 9-5 office job, to a warm home and a soft bed and I get to cook lovely homely meals for us both. Every day I remember the conditions I survived through and made the best of. Because of that experience and others I had living there I am always appreciative of the life I have now and the work it took to get here."
"  a secret pregnancy, followed by a heartbreaking miscarriage, weighs heavily on woman's heart as they navigate the emotional turmoil alone.","Reddit, what secret are you “taking to the grave”?

Several months ago I (22) had I'm lonely and you're lonely s x with my ex girlfriend (19). The next day we woke up and decided mutually that it was a mistake and we should move on. Well, that small mistake turned into a larger one: she got pregnant. We wrestled with a lot of things for the next few weeks. Did she want to consider abortion?(No) Did she want to consider adoption?(Possibly). How do we tell our parents? My parents would be upset, then immediately turn into the supportive parents they are. Hers would absolutely cut her off, never talk to her again, completely disown her(they told her they would, hundreds of times, when she was growing up). So, we struggled. 1 week turned into 2, which turned into 3. She was now 8 weeks pregnant. I get a call one night last week around 1 am, she says that she is heading to the hospital, that something isn't right. I meet her there, she describes incessant bleeding and very, very bad cramps. After 5 hours in the hospital, the doctor confirms what we'd already begun to fear: she had had a complete miscarriage. Just like that, then, she was no longer pregnant. Even in the middle of this terrible incident, she said she wanted no one to know about it. No one. About the pregnancy, about the miscarriage, about anything. I'm still conflicted; miscarriages are very emotional events, and I can't go to my parents to talk it over with or hug it out with my best friend or anything."
"  strict food control, limited cooking privileges, and a months-long punishment reveal the unreasonable rules of oppressive parents in childhood.




","People who grew up with strict parents, what was their most unreasonable rule?

My mom was insanely controlling about food. Weird rules were in place like ""one slice of lunch meat per sandwich."" No one but her was allowed to cook. She'd make one giant batch of spaghetti or something and we'd have leftovers for days, so she only had to make dinner twice a week. She did not work or anything, just didn't like cooking every day. Breakfast was cold cereal and you'd only be allowed a small bowl with just enough milk to moisten it. Occasionally she'd bake something she called Corn Toasties which was simply cornbread baked in a sheet pan. She'd cut them into squares and fill the freezer with them and we could have one of those for breakfast as an alternative.
Once when I was fourteen I bought a pack of hot dogs at the store, snuck them home, and lit the grill. I was almost done cooking them when she came out screaming about fire hazards and swatted the plate out of my hand. She had been making spaghetti, what an ungrateful little bastard I was.
So then she orders a pizza for the rest of my family, wraps individual servings of spaghetti in freezer paper, and puts them away. She tells me that I will be eating nothing else until it's all gone. Took about two months to choke it all down. Went without eating a lot of days. I was also grounded for over a year."
"  a fourth-grade class develops an elaborate bean sprout industry, trading, housing, and fertilizers, only to face downfall when exposed.","What things did you do as a kid that you now realize is extremely weird?

When I was in fourth grade, so around nine or ten at a private school, we used pinto beans as counters during math. Well, one day someone realized if you put a bean in water, it would sprout. And it became incredibly fashionable to keep a couple living bean sprouts hidden in your desk at all times. This turned into a whole industry, sneaking to the cabinet in the back and stealing the beans was risky. So people took on those roles. The beans were old, so getting them to actually sprout was valuable. Others would sneak the sprouts in and out of class to get sun. A boy's grandparents had bought him a science experiment kit that came with hundreds of these little plastic vials that stood up on their own. They were the perfect size for keeping a sprouted pinto bean. So he started trading them. Another two kids had water bottles with a straw that fit neatly into the vials and made it easy to water the sprouts. They turned it into a service. One pretty talented group of girls started making houses out of paper and cardboard for the sprouts to live in. This allowed bean families to become a thing. Another girl realized that the houses meant there was a market for bean sprouts, furniture. Kids starting pulling textbooks out of their desks and stashing them around the classroom to make space for larger and larger houses. The houses were a turning point because they ran anywhere from $5 to $10, which was the first time anyone had charged real money for something instead of bartering. In addition, demand for sprouts went through the roof. Since you could fit four or five in a house. The kid who had been successfully sprouting the beans is under immense pressure to produce, and we've crossed a threshold so people are willing to pay real money now. Into this high pressure situation, walks my classmate, Julia. Julia brings a tiny bottle of purple liquid one day and tells Bean sprouts her kid that it's the diluted slime of an extremely rare snail from the forests up north that she collected herself while camping with her family. It's such a strong fertilizer even diluted that one drop in each vial will guarantee that of being will sprout. In addition, a drop to which already sprouted bean will ensure a nice green plant. There's enough for around 50 sprouts in there, but it's going to cost them $20 for the whole bottle. Well, if you're selling the sprouts at $1 each, $20 is a steal. So the kid comes back the next day with the cash. Julia gives him the fertilizer and he puts a drop in each vial just before we leave to go home. The next day, all has been sprouts are dead, and he's pissed. Turns out the fertilizer was just Julia's mom's perfume, and it killed all the plants. Well, bean sprout, her kid is not the kind of person to take this lying down. So he goes to the teacher to tell her that he got conned. And the whole thing unravels. The teacher is upset that her students have been devoting hours of in-class time to beans. Parents are upset that money they thought was for snacks or field trips was for beans. The principal has to announce to the whole school that growing plants in your desk is now banned, which just confuses everyone else. And my class is angry at poor bean sprouting kid for snitching and ruining everything. All their hard work is now in the trash. The bean sprout industry never recovered."
"   regretful person rejects best friend's romantic advances, realizes feelings too late, faces cold treatment, and desperately seeks reconciliation.","I regret rejecting him

I regret rejecting him. So I have a best friend who we'll call J who's also my schoolmate, classmate and we live in the same residential area. A little description on J. He's tall, handsome, athletic, fit, smart, funny and sweet. He even has good hair and the most beautiful eyes. J and I had been friends from kindergarten up till high school. When we were in primary school he confessed many times but I only considered him a friend. I never saw him to be as handsome and amazing as everyone else did. Because I saw him almost all the time of my life. About a month and a half ago, J once again confessed to me. This time he did it more maturely and more in a sweet way that I actually felt butterflies in my stomach. But, I wasn't sure I felt the same. His confession did really make me think of it but I really valued our friendship more and I didn't think I felt anything for J. So once again I rejected him in a way I regret to this day. I laughed and said, ""So I'm still your little obsession. Grow up and move on already J. '' His face after I said that made me regret my words. He didn't laugh like I did. It seemed like he was fighting back tears. I honestly didn't think he was being 100% serious because he would always say how he will confess 100 times a week to wait for me to say yes. J just walked away and left. He didn't come to school the next day. He didn't come outside when I went to call him to walk together to school. He ignored my calls and texts and when he did see them, he never responded. At first I was angry at him. Why was he taking rejection so seriously? I already rejected him enough times for him to get used to it, That's what I thought then. But the more I didn't get the notification of his text, his random FaceTimes, the goofy TikToks he'd send me, The more I didn't get to see his name pop up on my notifications, I felt bad. I had made so many tries to text him when I finally sent him an apology of a paragraph but it was then I found out, he blocked me. He came back to school after missing 2 and a half weeks out. Those 2 and a half weeks I thought of him always. Our desks were together so I'd zone out while staring at his desk. One of my friends even told me I might have fallen for YOU but I denied it. I denied it until I saw him when he came back. J looked like a whole different person. He had dyed his blonde hair jet black and had gotten an amazing haircut. His aura completely changed as soon as he entered the class. Everyone looked at him and I did too. He sat down at his desk and didn't even turn to look at me. Everyone came and showered him with compliments about his good haircut and he suddenly had the most charming smile as he thanked everyone. Well everyone but me. I turned to him with a happy smile and said, ""Black hair really suits you well. You look so handsome."" But he ignored me and continued to speak to this other guy who even stopped talking so J would react my comment but nothing. He ignored me the whole morning and when our homeroom teacher came he asked to switch seats but was denied. He ignored me and hang out with the people he knew I didn't like. He always walk away when I tried to talk to him. I had actually come to accept that I liked him back. I even asked my friends and my sister and even my mom if feeling certain ways after he left meant I liked him and my mom said, ""Maybe he just needed to leave for you to realize how much you care for him."" And my friends and sister said the same. I decided to go and tell him the day after he returned. I didn't get the chance in the morning because he went to his new friends and when I tried to talk to him he went away. I felt so bad that I went crying in the girls bathroom. I regretted it. I regretted it so much. I wished I had just accepted his feelings then and tried to see if I'd fall for him with time. I shouldn't have waited this long. He ignored me completely and acted like we were never even friends for the rest of the days that followed. I had enough of it though. Since he had me blocked everywhere I took my sister's phone and sent him a long message confessing my feelings, apologizing and asking him if we could be friends again and telling him how much I missed him. I begged him to talk to me and really hoped he would see it. Now I'm waiting for his reply. I feel so distressed I wanna cry. I feel anxious. I feel like he'll make fun of me. Or reject me even worse but I'm ready for any response as long as he talks to me and reads my message. I don't care if he hates me now. I know I made him angry and I want to fix it. I feel sorry for how mean I rejected him too."

A month later, I checked the phone bill to find that it never stopped. Confronted her again. Cue more begging and more denial on my part that she would let the life we had built go down in flames. This went on for a few months. So many promises. One night, I caught her on the phone when she thought I had left. Suddenly it's not just texts. Sometimes it was phone calls too. Just a friend she could talk to that she let things go too far with. Promised to break all contact. Swore it was never physical. Then I found emails. She detailed things that made me sick to read. But also included descriptions of his house. She broke finally, but swore it was all just in the line of duty. That's how she met, you see? Visiting nurse service, and this guy was a client. Promised she was done. Loved me, you see? No chance she was going to let 15 years go like that. I wasn't buying it anymore though. She announced she was going out one night with a work friend. Promised they were only going to the bar, then she'd be home. Maybe late, but not too late. She had taken over her own phone account by then, but wasn't bright enough to understand that Google Latitude was still showing me where she was, and I wasn't about to show my hand. She kissed me goodbye and bee-lined right for his house, and was there until the wee hours of the morning.

I've suffer for at least 6 months, finally I can push her into the darkest pit of hell. It's a long story, so let me light up a cigarette and tell you all about it. I met my girlfriend when we were on a same vacation tour back in 2006. The first time ours eyes met, I've made a promise to myself that I have to make her my girlfriend. The process wasn't hard by any mean, I just poured my truest, deepest love out to her, to make her moved by my true feelings. I loved her, I truly, really loved her. But due to my job, I had to travel a lot. Sometimes I would be away from home for 15 days to a month. About 6 months ago, I noticed she had been showing signs of a cheater. She's always tried to hide away from me when she was on her phone, either if she was texting or calling someone. I just lay my eyes on her phone and she would turn it off. I can almost confirmed that she was cheating but I didn't have any kind of evidence. I have an email account that had been login in for a good while but rarely use, and then one day there were hotel bills sent to this email. I checked the emails and some other things and found out there were some note lines about the bills. After that there was nothing left to clarify. But one man's soul can't truly die when he haven't dead, me and some friends had found out about the man she had been fricking with and the hotel's location. The first thing I felt when her cheating on me was confirmed was anger. I was furious, not a bit of heart-breaking. It is the feeling when you wanted someone to die, gone, disappeared. I wanted her to suffer and die. So reality has proved that money can solve anything. I found the way to contact the other man, his wechat, (it's like Facebook for Chinese) to be exact. I have friends that really, really talented, smart people, if I could tell. I made friend with a doctor back in August last year. I told him my story and what was my plan, also sprinkled in a bit of ""You can have benefit out of this too, of course I'll pay the money"". He made up his mind for a few days and then gave me contacts of some female patients that have HIV (there was no mention about the strict policy in the hospital about patient's privacy). Out of 3 patients I've met, only one agree. Most of the ones who have HIV haven't had a ""clean"" life. When you have the money, you really can control the devil himself. I gave her the other man's contact and an amount of ""fee"", and required her in the shortest time she could, give him HIV. This modern life make it really easy for a woman to sleep with a man, it only took her 5 days. I worried that only one night wasn't enough for him to have HIV, so I asked her to be his FWB for a while, and gave her 15.000 yuan (~2150 USD) My girlfriend still haven't known anything. She did really fall for him. I knew it since reading her texts. About 2 weeks before Tet, she had a fever. A terrible, agonizing fever. I knew she already had HIV (We did had intimacy but I had my rubber on). I told her to go to the hospital but due to my job, I had to be away for several days so I couldn't cut it to the hospital with her. I would pay a fortune to see her face when she found out about the HIV tho. After 2 days I went home and saw her being upset and all, and then after asking my friend at the hospital, it is confirmed that she has HIV. I.was.ecstatic. But I played it cool, I was the dumb boyfriend that haven't know anything (she didn't know that I already got the info about her HIV) . We're still being together for now. I want to witness with my own eyes her being slowly dying on the hospital bed. That's all, if there's anything happened I'll tell you later."

I was installing an electric dog fence in my teens and I had to do something with my hands so I put the electric leads between my teeth for a moment, activated the power and shocked myself in the face. The electricity clamped my jaw muscles shut and I had to rip the wires out of my teeth.

When I was a kid we had a subtraction math test, but I accidentally did them all addition, so I just changed all the - to + and hoped the teacher wouldn't notice. When I was in my early 20s I started a new job and to try to ingratiate myself to the office staff I put up a white board and a couple times a week I'd put up a new movie quote and try to have people guess it.

The next day the board was gone and someone informed me the owner and CEO had a mentally handicapped child. Until a few months ago I didn't think US mail in ballots got counted unless the election was close. When I was 15 I was batting in baseball and took a pitch to my knuckle, which then broke. I kept batting, wondering why it hurt so much. As a teen I was in gym class and wanted to try the parallel.

A while ago I posted about my husband on another account. Both account and post have since been deleted but you can find it if you look for it. Some of you may remember my husband, who we shall refer to as Frotan. He used to fart in public, rank and rancid, and find it hilarious. There were gross sounding farts and often when I went to clean his clothes there was mucus in his underpants which reeked of ancient sewer systems. I have him an ultimatum - simply to stop farting on purpose when in public and at parties and family gatherings, or I’d leave him. He promised me. He continued his behavior though. At a family dinner at our house, he trusted a fart and fully blew chunks into his pants. At first he tried to say the sound and smell came from me, and I just stood up exasperated and left the table. When the stench stayed without me in the room, everyone knew it was him and he once again tried to blame me, saying that I cooked him bad eggs for breakfast. Everyone ended up leaving as he had literally spurted slime down the leg of his pants. I was mortified and had to tell all of our guests about his constant flatulence later on when they asked why I was divorcing him over this. He’s tried to win me back by promising not to fart any more and saying that he’ll even clean his own washing. It’s all too late though, for a 40-something year old man to act in such a way. His family has suggested I support him through whatever he is going through at the moment and said that brain conditions like Alzheimer's run in his side of the family. Call me cold but diarrhea runs in his jeans and I’ve had enough, medical illness or not. I’m done. I’m leaving."

Comparison:
My husband worked in a lab during grad school where his best access to the fancy machines for his research was in the middle of the night. So he'd often get back to his apartment at, say, 3 AM, after many hours of working in a place where you can't eat, hungry. One night, he put some chicken breasts under the broiler. Walked to the other end of the long, narrow apartment. Sat down on his bed for ""just a second.""
He was awakened at 5 AM by the fireman who had just chopped through his apartment door, waded through the billows of black smoke, and extinguished his chicken. The fireman was shouting at him for a while, and had to grab him and shake him. When my husband woke up to a fireman in full gear with an ax in his hand standing over him, WITH THE SMOKE ALARM STILL GOING OFF LIKE IT HAD BEEN FOR OVER AN HOUR, he just started laughing while the fireman berated him.
BONUS: He didn't clean up the black ooze under and around his stove (the dried mixture of chicken-ashes and extinguisher-foam) for months. Not until his mom was coming to visit. Not unlike the mess in our twins' room, which makes me want to curl up in a ball and scream profanities and develop a drug habit.

She said the party was at 5 but she wanted to come over around 330 even though it was a ten minute ride there. Totally figured she wanted to hook up first so I totally prepared myself for that. She shows up, I invite her in and I ask ""how long before we have to leave?"" She says it has already started so we have to leave now.

It was an open bar but she didn't drink so I resisted the temptation.

Eventually they convince her to drink. One sip becomes a whole drink and one drink becomes three. She is really drunk but still being kinda flirty. I didn't drink anything and played it on the safe side because I was driving. The plan was to leave halfway through and go to a house party. So I drove her and her coworkers there. What a horrible idea. We get there and it's one of the shittiest places I've ever seen. There was a 75 year old man playing Madden instead of watching the super bowl. There were kids running around while people were doing various drugs and talking about selling Crack along with pregnant women drinking.
Little uncomfortable but eff it. We all play a drinking game and then the girl goes to go to the bathroom down the hall. About 3 minutes later two of the coworkers went down the hall to the porch to smoke. About ten minutes goes by and her ex gets up to go see if the bathrooms open. He comes back and lays this on me: ""John.... Uhh.... Jen is getting plowed by both those guys right now. Don't go to the bathroom"".
I was absolutely stunned. I had no idea what to do. I sat there and just watched the super bowl. 5 minutes later she comes out literally pulling her pants up. She completely ignores me and continues playing. 5 minutes go by and she goes to smoke weed with another guy. One guy goes to check and comes back to let me know ""Yeah sorry man she's effing him now too"". The guys at the table start saying how nice a guy I am and that it sucks that I'm her date and she's effed three guys. Then they start getting weird. They start whispering about me and pointing at me. Was entirely sure either was going to get my ass kicked. She comes back. I tell her we're leaving at 5. One guy at the table stops me and says ""Wait! She's already effed Tim, Bill, and Mark, I figured me and Mike could get a go and you can have her the rest of the night!""
What. The. Hell. I left immediately with her. Unfortunately, her car was at my place. She kept saying the whole car ride that she hates it when this happens and this is why she doesn't drink. Took the long way home because I knew she was drunk. She tried to prove she wasn't by slapping herself and then saying ""I'm not drunk, I see the three yellow lines in the road. I know there's only two but that's how I know I'm sober"". Tell her to stay for an hour knowing I could prolong it so she can sober up. She throws a hissy fit that her phones are dead and her parents are looking for her. She says she has to drive home immediately. Get home. Say ""K bye"". She apologies and leaves saying she'll see me soon. Never talk to her again. She posts on Facebook for three weeks about how bad she screwed up, how her coworkers don't take her seriously, and how she has to move because of it. ""oh""."
"  bewaring of the overpriced Volcano roll at Japanese fast food restaurants; it's just a fancy California roll with minimal toppings.




","Fast Food workers, what's an item people should absolutely stop ordering from your restaurant?

I've posted about this, but I worked at a Japanese casual fast food restaurant for a while and we had this thing called a Volcano roll. It cost $7.25. A California roll there cost $3.75. The Volcano roll was a Cali roll cut into the shape of a triangle and topped with spicy mayo that has been heated up with about $.10 worth of fish, literally just a few bits. You are much better off ordering a Cali roll and paying $.50 extra for spicy mayo on the side and asking them to heat it up.
I had one guy come in with a girl and he ordered a couple of regular rolls like spicy tuna and yellowtail, along with a Volcano roll. When served in the restaurant, unless they ask us, we would put the sauce on top so it looked nice, like a Volcano. When I brought that roll over he was like, ""Oh, I didn't know you guys put the sauce on, I've only gotten it for pick up and the sauce is always on the side. I don't really like it, could you bring me one without it?"" I tried not to laugh and said sure. I went back and the sushi chef asked what was wrong. I told him that he didn't like the sauce and wanted one without it. He laughed and said alright, so he took a Cali roll, cut it up, and put it on the plate. I brought it back to the guy and he was super pumped. 
Basically this guy paid $7.25 for a roll that would have cost him $3.75 and me and the sushi chef got to split a free volcano roll. Normally I would have just told him about it, but the dude was being pretty arrogant the entire time. I'm guessing he acted like he was a sushi expert to impress the girl he was with.
If you're ordering rolls make sure to look at the ingredients and see exactly what you're getting because you could end up overpaying for a glorified California roll."
"  difficult clients: unrealistic expectations, time-wasting indecisiveness, and lack of self-awareness, making the tattoo artist's job frustrating.","Tattoo artists of Reddit, what clients irritate you the most?

I've had two people who I really just wanted to slaughter:
1. (Note, this happened within the first couple of months after my apprenticeship ended) A woman called ahead, wanted a tattoo covered up, and needed a female artist. Lucky me! I tell her I can't promise anything for that day but she can come and we will take a look. She shows up with her dude and four small children. I ask her to come back to my area since this is obviously a regrettable vag tattoo. The whole party comes with it! Neat. The best way I can describe this tattoo is a tribal butterfly over the whole ""mound"" area, with the ""body"" being some dude's name right along the lips. She wants the name covered by....ANOTHER NAME. Because this guy she is with is probably pretty sick of sticking his soldier into a punani that is clearly labeled as belonging to ex-dude #1. Smart cookie as she is, she can't understand why a name won't cover another name, especially not on these saggy old lips. Me being a baby at all that, I refuse on the premise of not having any experience tattooing actually on punanis (although honestly there's no amount of money that you could pay me to deal with this crap.) she's outraged because she drove twenty whole minutes and so forth, switching to angry half-Spanish somewhere in there. She refuses to talk to two of my male coworkers who say they will do it but it won't be cheap. She tells me she doesn't care that I don't have experience, I internalize the fact that this is the basis of what is wrong with the industry- nay, the universe even- and let her lead her caravan elsewhere.
2. Emails me telling me she loves my work/style, wants to get a couple smaller tattoos, we set up an appointment. She comes in with ten crappy butterflies with swirly garbage around them printed off from some website akin to 'freetattoodesigns.com' or something. I say, ""hey, if you like my work, let me draw some custom butterflies up, that'll be cool."" She says, ""oh I just like these, these ones are fine."" She somehow spends an hour dictating where each crap butterfly will go and how she wants the swirls. She refuses to get tattooed that day, as she decided that it was instead a consultation. For two two-inch tattoos. If you are wondering, this is EXACTLY how I like to waste my time. She comes back the next day and wants to change half of this swirly nonsense and dictates every line of it as if she has a discerning eye. Screams and squirms through the whole thing. Makes me stop with every color so she can point exactly where she wants the next dot of purple. The whole situation takes three times longer than it should have purely because she is terrible, but I'm stuck with the price quote I gave her previously. Icing on the cake: she has at least 4 other tattoos that are also just butterflies and swirls. I asked her, and the bitch doesn't even like butterflies that much."
"  a teacher misinterprets students' friendship as a mutual crush, only to discover they are cousins, leading to an awkward realization.




","Teachers, How Easy It To Tell If A Student Has A Crush On Another?

My students are all between 8 and 10 and a few have noticeably hit the point where they are obviously starting to notice the opposite gender. 
I have two students that I'll give fake names: a boy, James, and a girl, Lucy, in my class. They are always together: recess, lunch time, free choice, the two are always working together. They are both very shy and giggly and it seemed a mutual crush was there, noted by me and their math teacher as well. 
One day, I hear James getting teased by some other kids for his crush on Lucy. His math teacher and I pull him aside and have a talk with him. We tell him that we'll be talking with the class as a whole about crushes and teasing (he's not the only one). His math teacher also tells him that, if he does have a crush on Lucy, it's nothing to be embarrassed about because she's a nice, sweet girl. James just looks awkward and asks to go so we let him. 
A few days later, I'm walking my kids out to the parent pick up and I see Lucy's dad is here to pick her up. James waves to both of them as they leave and I ask if he's been over to Lucy's house to play and if he knows her dad. 
""Yea, miss. That's my uncle. ""
OH CRAP. I HAVE ENCOURAGED COUSIN RELATIONS. 
I awkwardly gather my nerves and start to say, ""ah, you remember that talk we had about Lucy and liking her? Ah well, I didn't realize she was your cousin so-""
""I thought you didn't. That was weird, miss. "" Then he just laughed and said he liked a different girl anyway from his older sister's class. "
"  a dangerous individual details a sinister plan involving theft, violence, trafficking, terrorism, and bioterrorism, beginning with just one dollar.","How Far Can You Go In Life With One Dollar?

I’m a menace so let’s get this started. Buy a small matchbox or lighter at a gas station near a state border, knock the guy at the counter unconscious, steal everything, pour a trail of gasoline leading to the main tanks, light it, and speed away at more than 100 miles per hour over state lines. Steal the cashier's identity and paste your own photo over his. Sell all the stuff from the gas station online and in person, make some quick withdrawals with the guy's cards and checking account before he notifies his bank, and use the combined money to buy some hard drugs on the other side of the Mexican border and resell them for more money in the States. Buy the services of as many slaves as possible with the majority of money you acquire, then drug them and put them in cages using supplies you bought with the remaining money. Sell the slaves in Mexico. While there, buy an AK-47 with your trafficking profits and get it smuggled over the border. Once you cross back over, pick up the AK. Drive your car into the front window of a gun shop in a reasonably remote place, end anyone inside with your AK-47, and take as many firearms, ammunition units, and accessories as you can fit in your car, plus any cash and wallets you can find. Attempt to buy some alcohol at small liquor stores in different states later on by writing checks in the names of your victims, using fake IDs created with theirs, and their cards. I'll break off into another paragraph here for the benefit of your eyes. At this point you're way too wanted to live in a registered residence, so you'd better steal some food and camping supplies to make a makeshift home in the wilderness somewhere. Holding up an outdoor supply store will do. Think of it as living out of your car, but you have to sleep in a tent because there are several thousand dollars of stolen firearms in your backseat. Now it's time to get big. Move your home to a location a few dozen miles from the Mexican border. Steal a bicycle. Bike to the border, illegally cross, and then seek out your contacts with the cartel and various human traffickers. Put out the word that you're looking for enough ricin to partially fill an envelope, and you're willing to pay with cash, substances, abducted people, or kidneys. If they choose kidneys, travel to a small town and kill some people before cutting their kidneys from their corpses. If they choose any of the others, you know what to do. When your ricin order comes in, make the necessary payments and mail it to the White House. The Secret Service will intercept it, and your fingerprints will be all over the envelope, but who cares? Now you've clearly and directly threatened the President's life, and you're easily the most wanted American citizen alive. Retreat to your car, make sure it's in a rural area not directly visible from satellite footage, and get to work. Raiding grocery stores in nearby towns can give you the resources to make basic improvised explosives. You should probably also steal a bigger car, a big windowless van should do the trick, just make sure you steal someone else's license plate to put on it so cops won't be looking for the right combination of car and license plate to get you on the spot if you pass by. Painting the car a different color is also a good idea. Buy a chestplate of Kevlar armor through your black market connections. Train in the wilderness for several months, all while rubbing a different kind of animal urine on your body after each big robbery to throw off bloodhounds. Rob some relatively low-security banks and burn the cash while you're at it. You're also going to need to steal some canisters of gasoline. Finally, get your black market connection people to hook you up with some form of RPG and some ammo for it. Kidnap people to trade if you have to. When you feel the time is right, drive your van to Atlanta, weapons in tow. Launch an armed assault on the CDC, inflicting as much damage as possible. At some point along the way, hold someone hostage and have a staffer show you where they keep the smallpox then end them both. This will inevitably be on maximum lockdown, but try to break in with your explosives and RPG if you can. If you get in, do whatever it takes to get the smallpox virus into the water supply or onto a place people touch a lot - crosswalk buttons would work. Fortunately for the population of Atlanta, you will almost certainly not succeed. Police officers and national guardsmen will soon be swarming the building, so entrench yourself in the smallpox room and fight them with everything in your arsenal. You'll die, but you'll be one of the most infamous Americans in history. And years later, someone on reddit would bring up the theory that it all started with a dollar bill."
  a bisexual individual finds women visually attractive but dislikes spending time with them due to incompatible dating preferences; prefers feminine gay guys.,"Women are boring, so I go for feminine gay guys.

I'm a bisexual guy. However, I have a very strong preference for women when it comes to visual attraction. Over the course of the years I've realized that I find women attractive on a surface level, but I don't really like spending time with them. I'll explain why later. I've been lucky to meet a few feminine guys who are called femboys usually and a few transgender women these past few years, some of them were really cute and decent people. It's happened on the Internet and in real life. Because I'm bisexual, I'm very open-minded and I don't care about a person's gender or sexual orientation or biological sex as long as they are attractive to me and I like who they are. I want to make it clear that I don't fetishize femboys or transgender women, to me they are just people. I have to say this because I know they don't like to be fetishized and I know they just want to be treated like normal people. The reason why I like them better is that they suit me and my dating preferences better than biological women do. After spending time with feminine gay guys and transgender women, I've realized I've lost the motivation to date biological women. There are many things about them that I really don't like and that make it impossible for me to want to be around them. One of them being the fact that women like to take things slow. Biological women tend to give me attention and hints regularly because I'm a conventionally attractive man, however, this still doesn't please me. I need more intensity and fire than women are able to provide. For example, if I walk into a gay bar, I'll have plenty of people approaching me because I'm attractive. It's not that I'm only looking for intimacy, I do want relationships and I do enjoy the emotional aspects of a relationship. However, unless I don't like you and I don't want to take things further, I expect things to go fast and wasting time turns me off instantly. I don't like how women approach dating and that's why I avoid them even when they like me, I'd given up on dating altogether and I was sad about it then I've realized I prefer feminine gay guys. They have the looks I like AND the mindset I like."
"  how cheaters often want to fix the marriage after being caught to avoid financial losses and losing their comfortable life.




","Why does a cheater want to fix the marriage after being caught, but rarely want to fix the marriage before they cheat?

Why does a cheater want to fix the marriage after being caught, but rarely want to fix the marriage before they cheat? I can only answer for my husband, who is the cheater, not for anyone else. I saw trouble brewing in our marriage 10 years ago. I talked to him about it. I told him he had made a career decision that would drive us apart if he didn’t change course. He agreed, so we decided he would stay in his position for two years, and then move up in his company, something that was certainly available to him. Two years went by. He didn’t express interest in changing his career course, so I reminded him of the agreement we had made two years earlier. He told me he liked the path he was on and intended to stay on it until retirement. I told him he was reneging on our agreement. I told him he was never home, I was lonely for him, I missed him, and I missed our life together. He told me he didn’t care; his career decisions belonged to him. So I accepted this and adjusted my life. I understand my husband cannot be everything to me, and I understand that no marriage is perfect. I pursued new interests, made new friends, and created a life I was happy with. Every year, I talked to him about my loneliness and my feelings of betrayal over his broken promise and my hurt over his greater commitment to his job than to me. He told me he is happy, and I should be happy for him. This went on for 10 years, as I said. I cannot go into more detail because I am starting to become upset. I’ll just say that during many of the years I was feeling hurt, lonely and betrayed, he was unfaithful. He told me it was so nice to have someone in his life who truly cared about him. He told me how he loved having someone to talk to. He told me she is his best friend. He said when I found out about her, I ruined everything for both of them. I don’t know why he said that, because I never told him to break up with her. She can have him, you see. The thing is, he wants to fix our marriage now. Why is your question. I’ll tell you why. He took me for granted for decades. He used and misused my trust and faith in him, and he never, ever thought doing so would blow up in his face. If I divorce him, he has a lot to lose, and he doesn’t want to lose his comfortable life or his agreeable wife. We have been married for a long time, so in our state, everything we have gets divided 50/50 in a divorce. He doesn’t want to lose half of everything. On top of that, I alone hold the mortgage to our home and land. In our state, this means that in a divorce, I keep the house and the land. If I sell or pass away before him, only then will he receive his half. He doesn’t like that. There are other financial losses as well. They apply to both of us, of course, but losing the ability to live in our home on our beautiful property is something he cannot handle. So now he wants to work on our marriage. He doesn’t get it, though. I’m not lonely anymore. I don’t miss him anymore. I don’t want to spend time with him. My eyes don’t light up when he walks into the room. I don’t smile at the pleasure of seeing his face. I rarely make eye contact with him. I will discuss the weather with him. I will remind his of his appointments. I make sure the bills are paid. I will never do or say anything to harm him. And when I’m emotionally and psychologically stronger, I will let him go."
"  young patient's desperate struggle to be heard by parents and doctors, resulting in a delayed diagnosis of leukemia.","As a doctor, have you ever thought a patient was lying only to find out that their condition was serious and potentially fatal?

As a doctor, have you ever thought a patient was lying only to find out that their condition was serious and potentially fatal? Not a doctor’s, but a patient’s perspective. I was six years old. It all started very suddenly, I was feeling very tired, exhausted even after lying down. I complained to my parents, but they thought I was making excuses so I wouldn’t have to go to school. (Mind you, I was a very bright kid who never had problems at school and at that time I even enjoyed it.) I tried to reason with my parents and prove that I was really not feeling well. I was six, no one believed me. Instead, my father would walk me to school the next day himself to make sure that I really went. That’s when it went really wrong. My elementary school was, let’s say, a 5–10 minute walk from my home. I couldn’t make it. I had trouble breathing and, after a couple minutes of walking, I wasn’t even able to walk anymore. To this day I will never forget how my father dragged me by my arm while I was choking, crying my eyes out and unable to raise my leg to make another step. He yelled at me for “throwing a tantrum” and I still had to go to school. This went on for two more days before they took me to see a doctor. She was a very nice, but also very old, lady who unfortunately sided with my parents. She talked to me about how school was a nice place and that I should be looking forward to it. I tried explaining that that’s not the problem, the problem was I couldn’t breathe when I walked. It’s like no one was listening though, and she kept going on about how learning new stuff at school is exciting, then proceeded to ask me if any classmates were bullying me and if that was the reason I didn’t want to go there. She did note, though, that I looked “a bit paler.” That’s about the biggest euphemism I have encountered in my life since I was literally pale as death. But thank god it at least made her draw my blood. The following day, I was yet again being forced to get up early and get dressed for school. Fortunately, before my father could literally drag me to school again, the doctor called. She said the blood results came back and that my parents needed to drive me to the hospital (which she had already contacted). I heard the word leukemia for the first time in my life. I kept the medical report; I still have a copy to this day. I was immediately admitted with my Hb levels at 56 g/l, pale as a ghost, barely able to walk and put on blood transfusions. Next day I had my bone marrow extracted. Those two tiny scars on my chest are the only reminder of what happened. Needless to say, I did get better, but I don’t think I will ever forget the helplessness I felt when no one believed me."
"  the parent supported their child's act of defending a friend from harassment, risking the child's academic future, but valuing justice.","What is the most badass thing your parent has ever done? 

This happened during college. I was down with viral fever and had to take a break for three days. My best friend, a girl, was in constant touch via phone and she sounded dull. When asked what the problem was, she said it was nothing and I thought she worried about my health. Day 4, I return to college and I learn that a guy from a different department was teasing her (in an abusive way) and was stalking her everyday. And she, being a very reserved and not so brave, did not even tell it outside. I went and punched the mofo right on his face and broke a couple of teeth. His friends came for his help and started attacking me and my friends came in from nowhere. Once this gang war was done, I and that guy were taken along with our friends to the principal’s office and he started hurling scoldings one after the other. I was a bright student and was always in the good books of every professor and thus it came as a shock to everyone. They called all of our parents and my dad came. Even my friend was taken into account here and her mom was called to the college (She didn’t have a dad). Everybody - My head of the department, my principal started scolding me and gave my dad a transfer certificate to fill up for me to take me out from the current college and put me somewhere else. They also told me I had spoilt my career now due to this and for also having a relationship (typical Indian brains ya know, roam around with a girl and she is your girlfriend). My dad remained calm and filled up the form and asked if there are any more procedures to be done. The principal and HOD were stunned (they were apparently just trying to scare us) and asked him if he wasn’t worried about my future. I still remember what he said “If I was him, I would have done the same, what he did was right. No one should stand by when a woman is being harassed. I want my son to be on the front lines to stand up for any sort of injustice. I know the girl for the past 14 years and she and my son have been friends since then”. Everyone got a month’s suspension and the opposite team got two months suspension, except for that guy who harassed her, he voluntarily got a transfer to some other college. I came out of college as a guy with triple placement and being the highest paid recruit of that year."
"  single father faces assumptions, lack of changing facilities, and limited access to parent-child activities due to societal norms and expectations.","What's something that sucks about being a man?

Thirteen years ago I brought my new born son home from hospital and began to raise him as a single dad. With no extended family to help, I was on a steep learning curve but totally focused on doing my absolute best for my son. We spent many days going out shopping, at parks, play centres, museums, galleries, restaurants, swimming pools; anywhere babies were allowed. I got used to the casual assumption from people that I was separated/divorced and enjoying an ‘access day’ with my son. A major problem away from home was my son’s habit of soiling his nappy (or diaper I believe in the US). A typical exchange would go “Excuse me, are there any baby changing facilities please?”, to which the general reply was “Yes sir, they’re in the womens toilets.” My reply being “Are there any facilities NOT reserved for mothers/female carers?” was usually met with “No, I’m sorry”, with a wide-eyed implication of “Why on earth should there be?” What male would want to change a nappy at a resturant/leisure centre/swimming pool?’ So, off I’d go to the mens toilets, go in a cubicle, and change him on my lap. No purpose-made changing table, nappy dispenser, nappy bin etc. On occasion, the look of shock and suspicion on other men’s faces as I’d emerge from a toilet cubicle with a baby/toddler shrieked “wtf? Is this guy a pedophile; what’s been going on in there, shall I call the police?” When my son was at crawling stage, I took him to a government-funded children’s centre, and booked him in for a stay-and-play session. I was trying to maximize the amount of time my son got to socialize with other kids. On the appointed day, we turned up for the session and I was asked who would be staying at the session with him. When the staff realized I would be with him, I was told no. My son had to be accompanied by his mother. When told that he has no mother or other living female relative, I was told that unless I could find a female to accompany him, he would not be allowed to attend. However, the centre did have a Dad’s day, usually spent playing sport and games at the local park. My son was still too young to even walk. I used to take advantage of cheap foreign holidays during term time when my son was pre school. Passport control always involved my son being asked where his daddy was. Hotel staff would look awkward and uncomfortable checking a single man into a room with a small boy. I fully understand the reasoning here, but understanding never lessened the discomfort and embarrassment. I believe things are a little easier now in the UK. I see changing facilities in some malls, separate from the toilets, but still often labelled ‘mother and baby facilities’ or similar. I still see advertising for ‘mother and baby’ activities, groups, forums etc. Mumsnet; a great forum for parents. Mothercare; great shop for baby accessories etc. Mother and baby club; great opportunity for mums/babies to socialize. I know being a single mum is hard, but in my experience, I believe being a single dad can be even harder."
"  a woman falls in love but stays with husband for family's sake, prioritizing their happiness over her own desires.","What does your heart say but you can't do it?

Leave my husband of 30 yrs for another gentleman that I fell madly in love with 11 years ago. Soon after we met and both fell madly in love with each other I was going to leave my husband. He knew nothing about us. But as I looked around my house at all the memories, all the fun, all the love, even all the rough times, I realized that I was about to shock and hurt my whole family. My husband doesn't deserve this, he has done nothing to bring this on himself. He had just said to me a few weeks before that he still loves me as much as the day he married me. My kids will think I'm a monster. “How could you do this to Dad?” I could already hear it. “How could you hurt Dad like this?” “How could you be so selfish?” And the kids would be right. Now understand that this was no little crush. I was 45 years old and happily married. Now when I married my husband I thought I was in love. Hes funny, loving, kind, intelligent, great in bed, I had it all, I thought. When I met this other man it was fireworks from the start. Romantic, exciting, passionate, and mind altering Love. For both of us. We were walking on clouds. Before long we just wanted to be together 24/7. He had great success trading stocks and was quite wealthy with several homes on all coasts of the US. We only had small amounts of time together up to that point, but were head over heels in love. After realizing that my husband, who is 63, has given me the best years of his life. He's a thoughtful and loving husband who truly adores me. We never had much money but always made ends meet. He was beginning to have heart problems and needed to be cared for sometimes when he felt really bad. One night I looked at him and suddenly he looked really vulnerable, weak, and old. The longer I though about what I was about to do to everyone I love, the more I didnt like me anymore. That forced me to make a decision right then. The next day I told the gentleman goodbye, it broke my heart. And his heart too, he was confused and clearly didnt expect this. I haven't talked to him since. That was 7 years ago. My family never found out about him. Even though I know I will likely never experience that kind of all consuming love again, I also know that the man I fell in love with 30 years ago still opens doors for me, still holds my hand in the mall, and will get back up out of bed to turn off the bathroom light I forgot, again, without bitching, will still be there, (even if hes dead) when I take my last breath. My children will not hate me for tearing our family apart. And best of all I don't hate me! My man has taken care of me in a lot of ways for alot of years. I will be there when he needs me, for everything he needs, with my whole heart. It doesnt even matter if I lost great happiness by making that decision. The enormous amount of pain it would have caused people I loved unconditionally ,that was avoided, far outweighs any benefits, no matter how grand that I would have gotten. I dont regret it but can't help trying to imagine how life would be if I had gone. But can never get a clear picture in my mind. That's probably a good thing because I would torture myself with it anyway. Jan. 5th we celebrated 30 years of marriage and this summer expect grand babies 4 and 5. That makes 2 granddaughters and 3 grandsons. I am painfully proud of the kind and loving adults all of my kids grew up to be. I am blessed and grateful beyond measure. And wouldn't change a thing. I want to clarify some things some of you guys are confused on. 1st is I never said I cheated on my husband, but things were headed that way fast. A lot transpired in a very short time, the force that was pulling us together felt almost like a magnetic attraction. We acknowledged that both of us felt it. And another thing was I didnt spill my guts about something I have never told anyone for some for validation that I “did the right thing”, I know I did the right thing.

"  avoiding inciting the narcissist. Cutting off contact, blocking them, and don't engage or ruminate. Rediscover your worth and forgive yourself.","What’s Something You Should NEVER do when you are dumped by a narcissist?

First, let’s cover what you should do and that would be get down on your knees and thank your Lucky effing stars that he has *released you. ( *released being a relative term, as I should caution you a narcissist believes that you are at their disposal for the rest of your live long days). I’ve come to realize that a discard is basically the narcissist Realizing that you are onto them and they’re not gonna be able to pull their bullshit off anymore without lots of resistance and lots of discord and on top of that, probably bored because you know you can only torture somebody for so long and then you want to move on to torture somebody else, am I right? So here’s what you DON’T do… You DON’T incite them… Because A narcissist is already of the mindset, That you, the main supply, is the reason his life is shit. You are the reason he’s unhappy. And narcissist always hold grudges, and will not forgive, therefore retaliation and revenge are almost always to be expected. Don’t Engage with him ever again! About anything! Do block him. And forget keeping ANY of your mutual friends because I guarantee you that person will be willing or manipulated into becoming a personal spy for the narcissist and if you think they kept tabs on you when you were “his”, give thought now to What he considers your punishment as he plots and plans ways to make your life a effing hell…forever!  DO NOT RUMINATE. That is a trap set by your own internal conflict as you try to come to terms with what just happened to you. It’s a process and trust me you will get through it, but the average person goes back to the narcissist seven times. I’m above average I went back 17. In 17 months since I’ve been removed from him, I would say the first half was nothing but self-loathing, guilt, shame and having to accept my own part in my abuse, because let’s face it…we effing stay or go back. Then the second half was forgiving myself, allowing myself to see the truth, beginning to heal, learning more about self-love and self-care, and then through that you start to See you’re worth. That is how you know you’ve made it over the hard shit. And you are actually going to be OK, when you can actually look back and say I can’t stand that effing piece of shit and if he comes near me I’m calling the police! DON’T take his calls! DON’T listen to his messages. You simply DON’T engage! For the first few months, DON’T let your guard down… They are conniving, calculating, hateful effs that will forever look for opportunities to eff with you. And I’m talking mine blew up my truck after I left because I was dying in the hospital and didn’t want to tell him what hospital I was in, so I lose a 2009 Tahoe that was paid for. And we were broke up when he killed my cat because I disobeyed him and went to court. He destroyed every phone I had in that relationship, which was nine phones, and almost every time we were either making up from a fight or in a fight and breaking Up. Either way you can rest assured he is either going to send you out with a bang or bring you back in with a painful reminder, so be on guard for the first couple of months. And now, for the most important DON’Ts of all… don’t forget that you had something amazing and attractive and wonderful about yourself, which was why you were targeted, and now you get to rediscover all the beautiful things about you and bring them back into the picture because if you were dating a true narcissist, the first things he took away from you were your smile, your laughter, your joy…they are emotional murderers. So now you have the opportunity To bring back That which was stolen from you, and if you don’t think there’s enough to bring back, then reinvent yourself because you’re not the same person. First thing I did was put on a dress and stop saying F bombs and a little polish for me went along way. Also, don’t forget To forgive yourself. Because even though we have some responsibility, in what just went down, you truly were conditioned and tricked and manipulated and abused and for that you could have a little grace for yourself."
"  a designer refuses to create knockoff wedding dress for spoiled cousin, causing family drama and guilt. Tradition disrupted.","AITA for ruining my family's tradition because she’s a spoiled brat.

As a family tradition I have designed all the wedding dresses for any of my family members. When my eldest sister got engaged she asked me to design her dress since I'm passionate about design and she’s always loved my style. Her dress was a knockout, everyone loved it and ever since whenever one of our relatives announces their engagement they ask if I can design their dress for them. I've always said yes because I absolutely love designing dresses. My cousin is getting married next February and called me up to see when we could meet so she could share her ideas for her dress and I can start designing it. I do not like this cousin at all, her parents spoiled her beyond rotten. I decided to still meet with her though and see if anything has changed since she's now an adult. She immediately shows me some photos of wedding dresses by Sara Burton and tells me she wants something exactly like the pictures, I try to suggest a change in neckline or color and she shuts it down and tells me she wants exactly that. I told her I would not be making her dress as I love designing clothes that embody their wearer and suit them, not rip off others designers so she can look fancy in a knock off. Some of my family and especially her and her parents are beyond upset and have been blowing up my phone because I've ""broken tradition and my baby cousins heart because she's been looking forward to having me make her wedding dress for years now"" I feel kind of bad but at the same time she's taking the fun and bonding out of designing a wedding dress.

"  a son cares for sick dad, but refuses to live with abusive, addicted brother and wife. Family divided, opinions vary.","AITA For telling my dad that if my brother moves in, that I will leave?

My dad was diagnosed with a pulmonary disease my senior year of highschool and has steadily been getting worse and worse as time went on. In my junior year of college my dad got to the point where he needed a caregiver, I was the only one willing and able to take on the role out of me and my three brothers. Justin didn't have a steady job or Vehicle, Jimmy wanted to charge our dad money and our dad couldn't afford it, and Zane refused to even help in any way. So I withdrew from college and moved to the town my dad lived in. I got a job to help ease the burden of the bills and took my dad to doctors and essentially did everything for our dad. Justin eventually moved in after 2 years to help ease the responsibilities I had and I am forever grateful for that. The issue is Zane is asking our Dad to move in and bring his wife Pixie. Zane is an addict who is still using. The reason I had no contact with him was because he is emotionally abusive to everyone around him, he and pixie are physically abusive towards each other and fight constantly and are always calling the cops on one another. He also put myself, our nephew and our niece in a dangerous situation last year that could have resulted in us getting our life taken. I also don't want him stealing from anyone in the house as he has a history of theft to help fuel his addiction. I know addiction is a disease, Jimmy was an addict for 90% of my life and is now clean and sober, our dad was an alcoholic who stopped drinking when I moved in to help. I have nothing but respect for those who fight their addictions, but I have no sympathy for my brother. When I got home after work my dad informed me that he invited Zane and Pixie to move in. I wasn't happy and told him that, he told me that he couldn't just let one of his sons be homeless then he reminded me that he could let anyone he wanted live here. The house is in my dad's name, but I pay half the bills while Justin and dad pay a quarter each. I've never used my paying a majority of bills against my dad and I didn't this time. I simply informed him that if Zane and Pixie move in, I would be moving out. He got angry and accused me of making him choose between his sons. I told him I would never ask him to do that, but I wouldn't live with them and just like how I couldn't tell him who he could invite to live here, he couldn't force me to live with someone I felt unsafe with and who has threatened me and stolen from me multiple times. Zane called me furious accusing me of using the fact that I was dads caretaker as leverage against him moving in. I hung up when he started calling me prejudiced insults. It's gotten out to our very large family what's going on and a majority are calling me a horrible son for threatening to move out if my brother moves in. However, my mom and other brothers are on my side."
"  car owner seeks revenge on neighbor by reporting party to police, leading to child abuse charges and foster care.","Hippity hoppity, you damaged my property. Bippity boppity, I'm calling the coppity. Bippity boppity boo, they're taking your kids too.

I apologize in advance for the length. TL;DR at the end
This happened shortly after college. My mom is a retired, disabled woman who now owns her house on a quiet residential cul-de-sac. She has lived there longer than anyone else. Her neighborhood has designated parking spaces at the end of the cul-de-sac, all with the addresses of each house painted in the parking space.
My mom doesn't get out much so I use her designated parking space. At the time, we lived in the same city and I visited her weekly to bring groceries, fix broken things, cook for her, etc. My mom parked her car in the backyard of her house, since she went out so little. Mom kept busy by gardening or baking/buying cookies for the children on the street.
Mom's neighbor, Ivy, never parked well. Whenever I stopped by, her car was always parked so close to my car that I had to park on the curb. I wouldn't have cared about Ivy's piss poor parking but for two things: 1) She had four or five kids and had parties almost every weekend, leaving trash in Mom's yards; 2) I loved my car, a 2016 metallic ice blue Dodge Challenger Hellcat, the first car I had ever purchased brand new. I washed that car once a week, detailed the interior, and had rules against eating, drinking, or even leaving trash in my car. It was my pride and joy.
Mom had called the police throughout Ivy's residence because of the parties. Ivy's guests would fill up the cul-de-sac with their cars, obstructing traffic, and get into loud, drunk fights at and after midnight. I often found empty beer bottles, empty condom wrappers, cigarette butts, and emptyncrack baggies on the fence between the properties, mostly on Ivy's side of the fence.
This is all important information.
One Saturday while having dinner at Mom's house, I heard a loud crash and my car alarm went off. I ran outside to see Ivy's older model Honda Accord back out of her parking space and speed down the street. Ivy's Accord had a dent from the front bumper to the door and the headlight had popped out. I approached my Challenger with trepidation and screamed in anguish at what I saw.
My car, my beautiful three week old car with less than 500 miles on it, had a dent stretching from the passenger's door to the front bumper and the right front wheel was tilted at a 30 degree angle.
I was livid and in anguish as I called the police, filed an online claim with my insurance, and arranged for a tow truck to take my damaged car to the dealership. The estimated cost of repairs came out to 3400 USD (total cost of repairs was eventually 6500 USD). I had a low insurance deductible (100 USD) but my car was parked and Ivy owed for the damages.
For two weeks, I knocked on Ivy's door or waited for her to come home. She stopped driving her damaged Accord and either rented or borrowed a Ford Fusion. When she was home, she didn't answer the door. When she wasn't, she stayed away until my rental car (a Dodge Charger) left Mom's parking space. I left a note on Ivy's door for her to call me, but only received harassing calls from restricted phone numbers or people blaring air horns in my ear when I answered.
The Revenge
About two weeks after the accident, Ivy's children came to Mom's house for some cookies. I noticed that two of them had bruises around their eyes. If Ivy hadn't hit my car, I still would have done what I did but maybe not as underhandedly. I had Mom take pictures with and of the children but waited until the next party to strike.
Ivy had a party that night or the night after. Mom called me to let me know and I installed an app onto my phone that gave me a fake phone number. I called 911 and reported the party. ""There's a loud party at 1007 Mountain Drive, and I'm worried because the children are around all these drunk adults. Please, hurry!""
Mom called to let me know the police had arrived. I drove to her house (stopping by the grocery store first so that appeared to be the reason), and saw Ivy and her boyfriend Bane already sitting in the back of a squad car. From a news broadcast, that night, I found out that Bane had warrants out for his arrest. Initially, the charges were disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace.
However, Mom turned over the photos of the children (anonymously mailing them through the post office with Ivy's address and name as the return address). Less than a week later, Ivy and Bane were charged with child abuse charges. I think Bane was charged with more severe charges as well for abusing Ivy's daughter. Either way, the children ended up in foster care, and Ivy and Bane ended up in prison."
"  new owner's tyrannical behavior, including unjust firings, schedule changes, mistreatment, and chaotic atmosphere, led to mass resignations and closure.","What happened at your work which caused multiple people to all quit at once?

Owners retired, they were literally the greatest people, both very sweet, but kept the place running like a well oiled machine, they took pretty good care of us and their restaurant.
When they left, they gave the restaurant over the their nephew who at the time was a busboy/waiter, kind of standoffish, didn’t really interact with us too much, a bit lazy at times, but for the most part did his shit and went home, he seemed okay. Until he got the power of being the owner, he fired four people, including two of the four cooks, and two of the three dishwashers, literally that same day, on a Friday night just before the dinner rush, all because he ‘didn’t like their attitude’.
He refused to allow people to take vacation that they’d already requested and gotten confirmed by the original owners, would change the schedule randomly without telling anyone and then scream at people when they missed a shift or came in late because of it. He’d refuse to replenish the kitchen until we were literally already out of things, then take forever to put in the orders, he showed up randomly and would drink at the bar, for free of course because he was the owner, and then bring in all his buddies to drink with him, together they’d get way out of hand and grab at women and try to start fights.
Within the first month of him being the owner, over half the staff had quit, usually walking out literally in the middle of their shifts, after being screamed at, they’d basically throw down their aprons and tell everyone else that they were so sorry but they couldn’t do it anymore. After the last cook, this big dude who usually kept the kitchen laughing and running at a decent pace, started crying in the middle of his shift and dropped everything he was doing after the boss came and yelled at him for being to slow and making ‘slop’, then walked out the rest of us just bailed along with him. Four months later the place was closed, his aunt and uncle were absolutely furious and devastated that he’d run the business they’d built up for over 30 years into the ground."
  person gifted concert tickets but missed VIP experience. Argument over going to a nearby bar. GF feels disappointed. AITA?,"AITA for ""tolerating"" a night out with my girlfriend?

Earlier this year I gifted my girlfriend (33F) tickets to a concert that she really wanted to go to that was this past Friday night. I'm (36M) not a fan of her music, nor the fact that this concert was in the city, but I wanted to make it a great gift. She was elated when I told her that I bought the VIP package (meet and greet, pictures with the band, etc.).
Last week my girlfriend began asking if we had to get to the venue early. Being the thorough, detailed person that she is, I assured her I would check. Instead, I was too busy with work. Honestly it was getting a bit annoying that almost every few days she would ask, so I told her I didn't see anything while deleting a bunch of emails from the venue for concerts I don't even care about. On Friday afternoon, she told me that she had tried looking things up and was only finding that the doors opened at 7. With that, I picked her up at 6 and arrived at the venue for 7.
Once inside, she showed security our tickets and asked about for the meet and greet. The bouncer informed us that the VIP was at 6:00. I froze, now my girlfriend turns to me asking if I received any kind of emails (the tickets were in my name). I told her that I deleted emails and she seemed to understand. I actually really enjoyed the whole time, so once her band's set ended, we decided to not stay for the last band. And this is where the trouble began.
It's 10PM, we're outside of the venue, and she suggests we go to a bar a block away and either walk or rideshare. Immediately I said there was not a chance. She mentioned that my car was in a secured lot and we wouldn't be far, but I lost my cool, which I admit was NOT the best way to go about things, and told her, ""You don't go out in the city. There is crime all over the place!"" She responded that we were in the city. I went off how I can't stand it here, so she said that we'll just leave. No raising of her voice, she just said she was fine with leaving. She was silent on the way back and I suggest that we go back to my place to finish out the night and she refused. This also pissed me off because I asked what was wrong with the bar next to my apartment and she shut that down with her short responses.
Overall, the night cost me over $300, and while she is saying more to me now as opposed to Friday night, she is being very distant. She told me she could live with not going to the meet and greet except for how things turned out afterwards and that is when the disappointment truly set in. My response was that I was only bringing her to the concert, nowhere else, and thinking of her safety. She continued that I shouldn't have bought the tickets if I was only ""tolerating doing so"".
I do accept that I made some mistakes, chiefly with making us miss the meet and greet. The timing of the concert should have made this an unforgettable experience since her grandmother just passed. Am I the a hole?"
"  sister asks person to style her hair for wedding after cancer treatment, but past conflicts and strained relationship complicate decision.","I’m Not Doing Your Hair Because You Had Cancer

My sister is getting married in a couple of months. She finished cancer treatments recently and her hair has been badly affected by this. She's very self-conscious of it so she wanted me to be her hair stylist on her wedding day, instead of going to a salon. She approached me about it a month ago and I said no. There have been some very mixed opinions in our family about this so I decided to post about it and see what the consensus would be.
Some bg/reason why I said no: She and I have had our many issues in the past. She lost one of her best friends around the same time I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder. She had expected our whole family to go to the funeral but our older brothers stayed home with me while our parents took her to the funeral. She was pissed at our brothers and at me. She said her friend had been the best person and we should have all been there for her. I, personally, did not like her friend. She was mean to me as a kid. She was mean to me up to the day she died even. So I wasn't grieving. I was also not good around people then. My sister told me she wished it had been me who died instead of her best friend, because at least her best friend would have cared.
About a year after that her boyfriend at the time had cheated on her. I had heard the rumors but our relationship was nothing at that point. She realized I must have heard the rumors and got mad at me for not telling her. I told her I hadn't cared about what was going on in her life, which is true. I reminded her of what she had said to me previously.
We kinda patched things up after not living together for a couple of years. We weren't close, but that's to be expected I would imagine.
When our oldest brother got married our SIL asked us both to be bridesmaids and asked if I could do her hair (I'm a hairstylist). She got really jealous of the fact our SIL spent more time with me, and that I was more involved than she was. She ended up mocking me for being so quiet and saying I must be a terrible stylist because everyone knows you go to chat to the stylist as much as to get your hair done, and I can hardly hold a conversation. Our brother was so furious with her that he almost kicked her out of the wedding party. It was then that I sort of detached from her entirely.
So while I understand my sister is vulnerable after having cancer and going through treatment, and I realize that she's self-conscious and really needing to find someone she feels comfortable with, I do not want to do her hair. I don't want to spend that time with her. I know what she thinks of me. She might find me the best option because we're related. But she has treated me badly for things I cannot control and has hurt me in some really big ways. My parents are pushing for me to do it and were horrified I said no, while our brothers are on my side. Am I the A hole?"
"  dream job lost due to past bullying behavior in high school, as former classmate threatens to resign, causing blacklisting.","I didn’t get my Dream Job because I was a bully in high school

I’ve been trying to break into a niche industry (30-40 jobs in a city with a population of 3 million) for a while now. I’m in my late 20s, and though it took me some time to decide what I wanted to do with my life, I have finished my degree and completed two internships. I’m working part-time in a related field and freelancing while searching for a full-time job in the niche industry. I’m willing to move for the right job, but I’d rather stay close to home — so I was stoked last summer when I got an interview for one of the very few entry-level jobs available in my city! I ultimately didn’t get it, but the interview went well enough they encouraged me to apply the next time they had an opening.
Then an acquaintance who works at the company called me up and asked if I wanted to get coffee. I figured she’d offer me tips on how to do better next time. Instead, she told me to give up on ever being hired there — turns out, a girl I had gone to high school with is a real rock star at this company, and she threatened to resign when it looked like I was about to be offered a job. (I hadn’t realized it was her because her married name is different.) I’ll be honest — I wasn’t a very nice person back then, and I probably was pretty awful to this girl. I looked my former classmate up, and her resume really is incredible. She graduated from college early and has won awards from people who’ve worked in our industry twice as long haven’t won. Her public-facing work is top-notch. I’m guessing she’s the kind of employee a manager wants to keep around.
My acquaintance’s prediction appears to be true: I didn’t get an interview for a new position at the company that would’ve been an even better fit than the one I’d interviewed for. When I asked why, I was told a staffer had raised some concerns and the company would not be moving forward with my candidacy. I’m heartbroken. I worked so hard for so long to get the training required for this type of work, and I don’t think I deserve to be blacklisted for something I said when I was 17.

"  person unknowingly encountered Ted Bundy at their mother's antique store, declined his offers, and escaped his sinister intentions.","People Who Encountered Popular Serial Killers Who Was It? How Are You Alive?

Everyone Knows This Person, but I guarantee you'll never guess who. It was 1977. I had taken time off work to have a baby and stay home with her. But I still needed an income, so my mother had hired my younger sister and me to do the dirty, back-breaking work in her shop while she took care of her first infant granddaughter. My sister and I were working at our mom’s antique store one summer day. Mom had just gotten a truckload of European oak furniture that needed to be cleaned and polished, had the handles screwed on and so forth. A nice-looking young man came into the store and started talking to my sister, who was 17 at the time. He introduced himself as Ted Smith, and we laughed and said we must be related as mom’s maiden name was Smith also. He chatted both of us up, but focused on sis for the most part. He purchased an armoire, but said he’d have to go get his truck, since at the moment he was driving his VW Bug—an old VW Bug. He then asked my sister and me if we wanted to go out to dinner that night with him. We were sweaty and dirty from work, I had a baby to care for, and sis already had a boyfriend, so we said “Thanks, but no thanks”. He asked me to ride with him to get his truck so he could drop his Bug off at the auto shop for repairs, but by that point I had to get home to my infant—-right away, because I was still nursing her and I thought my breasts were going to begin leaking at any minute. However, he wouldn’t give up trying to get one or both of us away from the shop. He said he could come back about 10:00 that evening for his armoire and asked whether one or both of us would be there. We replied, “No, we close the shop at six, and we both have places to be tonight.” He was persistent. “How about tomorrow night?” “No, we close at 6:00, except on Saturdays, when we close at 4:00.” He asked whether one of us could meet him early in the morning, like at 5:30 a.m., but neither of us wanted to. He was getting to be a bit creepy and sis and I were eye-rolling at each other. Eventually, he said he was sorry but he couldn’t buy the armoire if we couldn’t be flexible. We hated to give up the sale, but after he had been there for two hours, we thought he was just looking and taking up our time. We still had a lot of work to do on the furniture that had just arrived in the shop. Finally, we just wanted to finish our work and go home. At 6:00 p.mAs we were leaving, his VW Bug was parked outside and he asked us whether we wanted to go for coffee; he especially wanted my sister to go. We said, “Thanks, Smith, but no thanks, like we said earlier, we have plans,” but he continued to be insistent. Finally I said, “Sis, let’s go—I’ll take you home.” Even though she had her car there, for some reason I didn’t want to leave her to drive home alone with this guy around. So he drove off in his Bug and we really didn’t think of it again… Until the next year, when his picture appeared in the paper. The Man Was Ted Bundy.

"  intoxicated college freshman reveals a traumatic experience of witnessing his best friend's suicide, leading to changed behavior and eventual recovery.","What terrifying confession has someone told you while intoxicated?

Freshman year of college, among all the new friends I made that year, there was one guy who was always a goofball. Very laid back, casual, down for whatever. The biggest red flag we got from him was that whenever people were drinking and hanging out, he would always essentially black out. He drank way too much and would kind of spaghetti-noodle his way around the party. While also intoxicated, after the party had winded down one night, a few people and I asked him why he always goes so damn hard.
While dropping his head a ton, sloshing around, and slurring everything, he told us about how a few months ago (the summer before college started), his best friend called him. They lived in a small town by the beach, and his friend asked him to come meet him to watch the sunset by the water. He biked over there, sat down, and they talked for a while, everything seemed fine. Then his friend took out a pistol and shot himself in the head, killing himself instantly. Apparently my friend had to call the police while covered in blood, brains, and skull fragments, just totally in shock. And then a few weeks later he went off to college a few states away, still in shock and unable to sleep or focus on anything.
He didn’t remember telling us that story, and I don’t think any of us wanted to bring it up. His drinking habits didn’t change until he was about to graduate, by which point he started going to therapy, got a job right after graduation, and seems to be doing better in the years since (thank god)."
"  Narrator experiences a strange sequence of events, including a vivid dream-like experience, making them question the nature of reality.","What Story Made You Realize Life Wasn’t Real?

two weeks ago, I was about to get ready for a party at six. Just before I started getting ready, one of my friends messaged me, super excited because a boy she's had a crush on for the last four years finally asked her out, and he was coming with her to the party. While I was texting her back, my younger brother walked into my room and asked if I could drive him to his friend's house, which I agreed to do. Then I went to the bathroom to have a shower and do my makeup.
So I got in the shower, but when I went to wash my hair I realized that my conditioner was finished. I was pretty ticked off, because I'd only bought it a couple of days beforehand and it's an expensive brand (my younger sister always uses up my things, so I knew she'd used it all). She'd also trashed the bathroom, leaving water everywhere and her dirty towel on the floor.
I was pissed off, and was about to get out of the shower in order to tell her off and get some more conditioner. But as I went to get out, I realized at the last second that she'd kicked the grippy mat we have at the bottom of our shower-tub up (our shower/tub is SUPER slippery without the grip mat). So as I went to step out, my foot slipped and I fell with my neck down onto the edge of my tub. Time seemed to slow down in my head, and I remember my last thought was ""Wow, this is how I die? How stupid.""
But here's the thing- at the moment of ""impact,"" I woke up in a start, back in my bed. I know it sounds stupid and cheesy, like something from a dumb netflix show, but there's literally no other way to describe what happened. I was lying in bed right before I got up to shower the ""first"" time, but I don't remember falling asleep. And the thing is, I've been a lucid dreamer for the last five or so years, and if this was a dream, it was way more vivid than anything I've ever experienced.
What weirded me out though, was that the exact same friend who texted me the first time messaged me after I woke up to tell me that the boy she had a crush on had asked another girl out, and she was pretty bummed about it and didn't want to come to the party. I was weirded out that there was some similarity between that and the ""dream,"" but didn't think much of it at first. As I went to reply, my younger brother came in to ask if I would take him to his friend's house. All the blood drained from my face. He just stood in the doorway looking confused, and asked me what was wrong.
I rushed into the bathroom, feeling like I was losing my mind, and went to check the conditioner bottle. I know this sounds completely crazy, but the bottle was finished just like before. And the grip mat was kicked up.
At that point I went to lie back down in bed and texted my friends to tell them that I wouldn't be going to the party."
  father's legendary April Fools' prank involved a fake train sound and terrified a drunk dorm resident; he awoke confused and suspicious.,"What’s Your Greatest April Fools Prank Story?

As much as I'd love to take credit for being the prankster in my family, that honor belongs entirely to my father. He has a reputation for enacting fiendishly clever capers, like the time that he whittled a block of cheese into the shape of a bar of soap (complete with the Dial logo) and left it in the shower for my stepmother to encounter. I know I'll never forget the time that he started covering the entrance to my room with newspaper, and then - after I'd gotten into the habit of bursting through it head-first - nailed a sheet of plywood up behind it.
Still, my father's best-ever prank occurred during his college days, when he lived in a dormitory reserved for engineering students. There was one tenant who didn't quite fit in with everyone else, as evidenced by the way that he would come home drunk every night, stagger through the halls, and scream profanities at anyone unlucky enough to encounter him. He was also, it was discovered, the only non-engineering student in residence, and nobody was entirely sure how he had come to be housed in the building. One way or another, he was a nuisance.
So, on April Fools' Day, my father and his friends decided to teach that guy a lesson.
With the cooperation of the entire floor, they strung a series of speakers together in sequence, so that adjusting the L/R balance on a stereo unit would make the sound move up and down the length of the building. Then, they removed all of the lights in the hallway, leaving only the sinister red glow of the exit sign as illumination. Finally, they acquired a novelty record, which they queued to play a very special sound effect.
When the drunkard returned home that evening, he was greeted by a long, dark hallway and an ominous, eerie silence. According to my father, the guy mumbled to himself in confusion for a moment before beginning to stumble in the direction of his room. Then, from in the distance, there came a barely-audible sound. As it increased in volume, it became recognizable as a train, blowing its whistle as if in warning of some dire calamity. The inebriate faltered in his course, wondering aloud (and with obvious concern) what exactly was going on.
The sound of the train grew further in volume, to almost deafening levels. The drunk - now visibly panicking - began to shout for help. Finally, just as it sounded like the train was bearing down... my father's friend came running around the corner with a flashlight taped to his head.
Legend has it that the drunkard awoke in the hallway the next morning, unaware of why he had soiled himself, but intensely suspicious of the toy locomotive that was clutched in his hand."
"  a wild party unfolded with a wasted birthday boy in the tub, a girl speaking fluent Spanish, and a messy bathroom escape.","What is the most NSFW thing you have witnessed at a party?

We were throwing a house party for one of our room mates that was turning 21. Said birthday boy was wasted fairly early in the night and was placed in the bath tub with the curtain drawn. Their logic was that he could sleep and if he threw up he'd be in the tub.
A couple hours later this girl shows up. She was a friend of a friend, 18, maybe 5 foot tall super white girl who just got off her shift at ""Twin Peaks."" As the mostly sober host, I welcomed her and went outside to have a cigarette.
Maybe 15 minutes later I return inside to find the tiny white girl on the floor puking into a trash can. Well that escalated quickly, but not shocking considering her size. The start of the weirdness was that she was conversing with my friend Daniel...in fluent Spanish. Oh...ok so she speaks spanish. A little surprising but whatever. So between heaves Daniel and I help her to the bathroom to pray to the porcelain god.
She wants to shut the bathroom door. I say sure, but not to lock the door so we can get in there if she passes out to make sure she doesn't, you know, die. Of course, as soon as she goes in she locks the door.
What we had forgotten was that Birthday Boy was asleep in the tub. He was awoken by, what he described as, ""the worst smelling shit"" he had ever smelled in his life. Not wanting to let this random girl know he was hiding in the bathtub, he did his best to keep quiet through the gagging. Tiny Girl had diarrhea so rank that she decided that she was too embarrassed to face the party. Her solution? Climb out the tiny bathroom window. When we got the door unlocked and went in we found her halfway out the window, her shit covered thong on the floor, and Birthday Boy pale and sweating in the tub after his unwanted birthday surprise.
She slept on her side on the couch with a female friend to watch over her. The next morning she claimed to not remember a thing and swears she doesn't know a word of spanish."

"  how assumptions about men buying women drinks at bars being nice often lead to negative consequences and judgments for women.




","What does everyone assume 'must be nice' but actually isn't?

Having men buy you drinks at a bar. And please listen with an open mind.
There is absolute truth to the statement ""there's no such thing as a free drink."" The best description I've heard is something I read here months ago: a drink at a bar is an unwitting game of social Russian roulette of which we don't know the outcome but are responsible for the consequences.
If we politely decline: We're a cold bitch, and in some situations, this can result in someone intentionally making the rest of the night more difficult. Worst case scenario, the guy feels entitled to follow us and let us know how he feels about it.
If we accept but do not allow physical contact, We're a cold, manipulative bitch. And with the purchase of the drink, someone feels they have purchased the rights to our boundaries, whether they be physical or emotional. This can also result in the situation described above.
If we accept and do go home with them: We're a slutty bitch, and if the night ends with us being forced into something, the outcome was our fault anyway and ""what did we think was going to happen?""
Don't get me wrong. There are gentleman out there who will purchase a drink, smile and respect what a woman decides to do with it. Unfortunately, though, women can never be 100% certain if you're in the group of men who won't be the gentleman."
"  a shooting range nightmare: Entitled mother and son point guns, disregarding safety rules, leading to a confrontation and police intervention.




","Entitled mother and son point their guns at me at a shooting range

This happened last week, so i'm trying to wrap my head around it still.
Firstly, I love guns. nearly everything about them. the sound, the recoil, the fireball. what I don't like is when an idiot is given one. When idiots have guns, people get killed. So when I see a mom and her nine y/o son at a gun range, i was initially happy that this kid was being taught at a young age. I go to my bay (right next to mom and son, who was actually quite nice), when I see mom’s handgun pointed at me. So I jump out of the way of the barrel, and tell her to keep it downrange. She scoffs at me, pulls the ""not loaded"" bullshit, to which I reply that I don't care, always treat it like it's loaded. I had two guns with me. My Springfield XD-40 subcompact handgun, and my AR-15. Now, continuing the story.
You should all know who is who in terms of abbreviations.
The kid goes up to shoot. He starts firing, and when he's done, he sets the gun down so that ti points at me. Being a kid, and probably new, I tell him to always keep it downrange, for safety. he acknowledges this, and points the gun back, when I feel a firm smack to the back of my head.
Entitled mom- Don't talk to my son like that!
Me- I'm trying to teach him gun safety. If anybody gets shot at one of these ranges, the place can get shut down.
Entitled mom- Don't talk back to me!
She moves to hit me again, to which I hover my hand over my XD-40 which was resting on the table. That sends her enough signal to back off. When she goes up to shoot, she pulls the trigger, to which... nothing happens.
She points the gun at me AGAIN, to which this time I yell at her to keep it downrange. She decides to ignore me.
Me- Ma'am, if the gun misfires, keep it down range because it may have had a delayed firing!
Entitled mom- Shut up, asshole!
I go back to shooting my handgun, to which I see, once again, that the gun is pointed at me. The worst part?
SHE WAS FIDDLING WITH THE GODDAMNED TRIGGER!
To those who don't know, the rule is that you can point your gun at somebody if you feel they genuinely jeopardize your life. I wasn't quite there yet, so I called over range safety. Range safety told her off,  and she listened, UNTIL SHE DID THE SAME DAMNED THING. Now I point my gun at her.
Entitled mom- What the f are you doing?
me- KEEP YOUR GUN DOWNRANGE!
range safety comes over to calm me down, and he takes the gun from mom. Then she tries to throttle range safety. So I take the gun from him, and field strip it (disassembly in case of emergency). I noticed the safety was on, but the gun was fully loaded. So I point my gun at the mom and tell her to get on her knees with her hands behind her head.
Entitled mom says, “I'll sue you for this bullshit!”
me- (to the little kid) never say anything you have heard today until you are older. (back to mom) Go ahead. I'll just show that camera footage.
Range safety calls the cops, and when they arrive, I field strip both my guns. I get cuffed, asked a few questions, and then released to put my guns in their cases. The mom is screaming bloody murder as she's taken away, and the kid is just crying. So then I go the the kid, and try to calm him down. She then screams that i'm trying to kidnap her son. I just back away (and the kid has calmed down) and just put my hands up. Cops close the car door, and then they get contacts for the kid's dad."
"  fifteen years ago, a person on a work trip to Las Vegas turned $50 into astonishing $46,000 through poker and craps.","What's the best luck you have ever had in your life?

About 15 years ago I had to go to Vegas for a work thing, I had no extra money so I really was not excited about going. Being broke in Vegas is no fun. I was there for 3 nights. First night I decided that I would play in a $50 poker tournament, it would fill up the evening and that way I wouldn't gamble anywhere else. Bam! Took first place for $1500. Being ""responsible"" I went and put $1,000 in my bank and kept $500 to play with. The next night, I go to a craps table with $200 and I go on for about a 45 min roll. This was at the Paris where they have the ""firebet"" which is a $10 bet that if you hit all 6 points its 1000-1. I hit that over the course of the 45 minutes, and, if you know anything about craps, it becomes exponential as you press your wins, so starting with a typical $10 pass line and $20 odds and like $12 on a 6 or 8--- by the time I finally 7'ed out I had $500 on each number and was hitting them over and over- Cashed out with $28,000. The final night, I did it again- just went on a 30 min run, hit another fire bet but since I was up so much I had started at a $25 min game, another $18,000. I basically parleyed $50 into $46,000 which was more than my annual pay at the time. That will never happen again."
"  girlfriend clinically died for 2 minutes and 46 seconds during an anaphylactic reaction, experiencing darkness and calmness without any afterlife perception.","People who have been clinically dead, what did you experience in death?

My girlfriend is anaphylactic, and it is triggered by a chemical called salicylate (found in pretty much every food). When she was in high school she had her first big reaction, and the school nurses refused to administer her epipen (adrenaline shot) until the ambulance got there. Now obviously, having an anaphylactic reaction doesn’t give you a lot of ‘waiting time’, so by the time the ambulance got to her school she was in pretty bad shape and barely conscious. The paramedics immediately administered one of her epipens, called the nurses “f ing twats” and loaded her into the ambulance as her mother arrived. She continued to fade, so they gave her a direct injection of adrenaline this time, still nothing. They give her a second direct injection of adrenaline and this time it hits her about 30 seconds later all at once, and her heart fails. She stops breathing, no pulse, nothing. Dead to the world. For about 2 minutes and 46 seconds she was clinically dead. And the scariest thing is, she saw nothing. She tells me that when you are losing consciousness you can’t tell the difference between waves of drowsiness and when your body actually shuts down. All she saw was the darkness of her eyelids, and it felt like going into an extremely calm sleep where she couldn’t hear or feel anything, and she didn’t mind it. All despite the fact her mother and the paramedics were screaming at her to keep her eyes open and the ambulance was flying towards the hospital. She miraculously just came back to life almost 3 minutes later as they were giving her chest compressions, and the cardiologist that assessed her later stated that all the adrenaline in her body was enough to not only stop her heart, but to also restart it with the little help from the paramedic pumping it around. But still do this day, she can’t differentiate falling asleep after a long day, and dying."
"  how people experiencing extreme cold may exhibit paradoxical undressing, stripping off their clothes before freezing to death, due to physiological responses.




","What are some mind-blowing facts that sound unreal but are actually true?

Before freezing to death, people will have a ""paradoxical undressing "" phenomenon and even shows a ""happy smile""
A few days ago, a video circulated online showing a man who died outdoors and was found stiff, with his clothes stripped down to his shirt and shorts. It is reported that the man was drunk the night before and passed out outdoors.
000
Many people think that people who are freezing will wrap their clothes tightly and curl their bodies together so that they can warm up. But in fact, in forensic science there is a professional term called ""paradoxical undressing phenomenon"", that is, before a person is frozen to death, will take off their clothes, with a smile on their face.
A study done by German forensic scientists analyzed 69 cases of hypothermia and found that a quarter of the patients voluntarily removed their clothing before death.
The reason for this phenomenon is related to the blood vessels at the end of the body.
When people feel cold, the most important thing is to ensure the operation of the brain, internal organs and other major organs, so the blood vessels at the end of the body will automatically contract to ensure sufficient blood flow to the major organs. In this state of stress for a long time, the muscles that constrict the blood vessels will fall into fatigue and can no longer work, and need to take a soothing ""break"". At this time the peripheral blood vessels on the surface of the body will all open, the blood quickly flow to the end of the limbs, the long-term cold state of the limbs instantly filled with warm blood, resulting in a ""very hot"" illusion. When this signal is sent back to the brain, the brain will send the wrong instructions to the body, so that people think its really hot, to take off all the clothes. At this point, people on the verge of freezing to death will struggle to get up and take off their clothes, thinking that taking off their clothes will be more comfortable, showing a look if relief so many people freezing to death with a “smile”. However once the clothes are off, the body temperature drops even more sharply and it doesn’t take long to die."
"  sociopathic patient chillingly admits to killing dogs and cats, exhibits curiosity about human harm, prompting concern for potential future violence.","What's the scariest thing a patient has told a doctor?

""I've been hurting dogs for a while now.""
The guy sitting on the bed came into the ER today because he said he wanted someone to tell him ""if I'm thinking right."" He wanted what he thought was a normal perspective and I was the unlucky person that he wanted it from. He told me that he had been having strange thoughts recently. He had been living in a travel trailer outside of his new job for the past month. He cleaned up inside the automotive repair shop at night after the other workers left. He said he thought the other workers there didn't like being around him. He then went on to tell me that he didn't have any friends and he didn't seem all that upset by that fact. He had befriended a stray dog however. The dog would come by the shop and he would feed him at night. He felt he bonded with the dog because they were both ""loners and outcasts."" But, ""something bad happened to the dog last night,"" he said. I hesitated but then asked him, ""what happened to the dog"" ""It died,"" he replied. He seemed to have zero emotion about this as he said it. His eyes were boring into me and he sat completely still. The silence was spreading out and I was getting uncomfortable. ""How did the dog die?"" I asked. With the same expressionless tone he replied ""I killed it."" ""I've been hurting dogs for a while.""
I asked more questions to unpack this and he told me about how he had killed an estimated 75 dogs and at least that many cats. He did it because he said he was curious about what was inside them. He killed them in a variety of ways and told me he always felt a great ""release"" immediately after doing so. ""Like sex"" he said. He would dispose of their bodies in a variety of places but usually someplace he could come back and see what happened to them over time. He was extremely curious about that.
of course, I recognized him as a sociopath. Tasked him if he had ever hurt a person and he immediately said no. Then he hesitated. ""I've been thinking about it a lot though,"" he volunteered. He had no particular person in mind but just the idea made him excited. I realized I was talking with what could easily become a serial killer. I told him that I felt his thinking was unusual and that I would like to consult a psychiatrist.
He agreed to that plan and I made a call.
The psychiatric service came and interviewed him for about 90 minutes.
She came out of the room and confirmed to me that the patient was a sociopath and potentially dangerous at some point in the future. He wasn't immediately sewer slidal or homo slidal. She felt he was safe for discharge and out patient follow up. I was sort of freaked out by that plan to be honest. I tried to influence for in patient treatment but it wasn't going to happen. She wrote up her consult note and discharged the patient.
He stopped me in the hall on the way out and shook my hand. He said "" really liked talking to you."" He then told me that he wished we could talk more often. I thanked him for coming in and watched him walk out the door. As he was leaving I told him to make sure to follow up. He turned and looked at me, then turned back around without saying a word and walked out."

He would jump into the pool when he was supposed to sit on the wall, splash other kids in the face, basically do everything he was told not to. Like borderline ODD. You could see it in his face, how he reacted with anger when being told not to do something. His expression was ""How dare you tell me not to splash kick water in your face?""
I finally made him sit on the bench in ""timeout"", which is usually the last time a misbehaving 6-year old tries to get away with running the show. Well, this one came back in, jumped into the pool (not allowed), then lined up a kick straight back into my chest.

I had to physically restrain a kid. I squeezed his arms to his sides and lifted him straight up out of the pool. He tried to kick me again while looking right in my face. I walked right to the door, called his mother, and called for my supervisor to bring his towel to the door. He was goddamn leaving the pool, no matter what mom or anyone else says.

"  growing up, an immigrant child assumes their family's newfound wealth is the norm, believing everyone in America lives similarly.","For those who grew up filthy rich, what did you think was normal until you learned otherwise?

So growing up I knew my family was better off than others once High School came around, but it didn't really sink in until college. My parents immigrated from Iran to the US when I was a little kid and didn't have anything. My parents had engineerings degrees in civil and computer, but my father wasn't allowed to work in our home country because he ""studied in the west"". When we came here they didn't speak English so couldn't work in their profession either. My mom stayed home with my brother and me, and my father worked several jobs. He saved up (along with a bit of money that final was unfrozen) and started a small business. It grew very rapidly but my parents didn't really change their own lifestyle. Since I was too young to really know what money is spent on when we were poor it didn't really occur to me that we became rich. I just assumed this is what everyone in America did (""The American Dream""), and that everyone else was like this. Starts poor and then can afford all sorts of stuff. It didn't help that my middle school and high school were very split between rich and poor so I figured the latter group was just in the process. I always heard college was expensive and some people could afford it, or that their parents had to save up or the kid had to get a job... I thought it was $1million per year. I figured that seemed like something people couldn't afford.
I based that on thinking that the lower class made $1million/year so spending a years wage on 1yr of college would be unreasonable. When I found out the average salary was less than my brother would spend partying in a weekend in college.
Also allowances growing up, I never had one and everyone else did, so I figured they were all rich. Then one day I found out this girl I was seeing (end of high school) had an allowance of $50/month and it blew my mind.
To my parents' credit, we immigrated to the states with nothing and they built a business that was successful. Also raised us very frugal, my dad still drives a 2006 jeep liberty and my mom a 2009 Ford Expedition. My brother and a few cousins love spending though. Edit. Turns out the Liberty is a 2001 and the Expedition is 2003.
They taught us to be very disciplined and financially savvy. I worked my ass off to go down the route of being a physician and on the side started a business. They made sure they didn't help me financially so I could learn how it was to grow a business. Fast forward several years and it became succesful enough that I focused on the business instead of being in medicine. I'm not far wealthier than they are and plan on giving the same type of discpline to my children. One of my best friends, whom I met in college, is very similar. His parents own a multimillion dollar company and throughout school he had to have a job and pay for everything himself."
"  Italian film controversy leads to professor's unjust dismissal based on ""lifestyle choices,"" resulting in legal action, settlement, and relocation to Italy.","Professors and university employees, what behind-the-scenes campus drama went on that students never knew about?

I was a professorial assistant to the Italian department and one of my favorite professors did a showing of a very famous Italian film Swept Away on a weekend.
This was an outside of class activity, which no one was required to attend. At a college with college age students. Just a ""we don't have time to watch this in class, so we'll watch it over the weekend in the auditorium.""
The movie in question would be considered...controversial by American standards. But Italian film standards it is also controversial, but considered a pretty important film for anyone studying film. It deals with some pretty intense issues involving dynamics between men and women, wealthy and poor as well as, depending on your interpretation, a ""s xual abuse"" scene.
I was working in the department when we did this movie showing and so I got a front row view of it blowing up. Apparently some freshmen, who are 18 years old, attended the screening and complained to their parents, who complained to the school. The school decided the best option was to fire my professor.
The Italian department went to bat for him, reminding the school that adult students attended the screening voluntarily. The school knew they couldn't get away with firing him specifically for that, so at the end of the quarter they revoked his contract renewal (he was supposed to come back the next year) for ""lifestyle choices that conflict with university standards.""
Dumb move. I don't know who on the universities legal team wrote it that way, but they should be fired. The professor in question was Pakistani and openly gay, living with his husband. As far as I understand it, he took their asses to court for discriminatory dismissal. They settled out of court for an unknown sum, but it was enough that my professor and his husband moved out to Italy where he now works at a university there and is very happy.
No one outside of the Italian department knew what happened. Professor was there one quarter and gone the next with no warning whatsoever."
"  a person experienced a terrifying encounter with an aggressive truck driver who pursued them closely, throwing objects and exhibiting aggressive behavior.","What is the scariest thing that has ever happened to you and still has no explanation?

One night I was driving home from dropping my girlfriend off at her place. We live in separate town, in the same county, about 25 minutes away, they're both country towns and the route between them is just back roads and state routes that cut through cornfields and cattle pastures. As I turn onto the longest stretch of the road, I notice headlights about a mile back. Every time I go over over a hill and back up, they're considerably closer. About five minutes pass and the headlights are filling my rear windshield, probably the closest I've ever been tailgated.
I've lived in the country for my entire life, so I recognize the lights as a Dodge Ram, and considering how lifted they appear to be, probably country boys in a tuned turbo diesel. Meanwhile, I drive a Mitsubishi Evolution, highly modified as well, but I rarely speed -I don't want tickets, for one thing, insurance is bad enough as is...- since I've also hit a deer on this road before.
Anyway, we keep on going and this truck flips on its brights and continuously lays on the horn. It's beginning to freak me out. So, when we reach a passing zone, I slow down to 45 and wave him by. Instead, he gets even closer, now maybe 2-3 feet off of my bumper and lays on the horn. Out of my side mirrors I can just see people hanging out the windows, hooting and hollering and waving objects. So, I speed up to 65 MPH and try to ignore the truck as it speeds up, as well, staying right there on my bumper.
We come down into a small village, population about 150, that has a 40 MPH speed limit and ample passing room. I slow down to 35 and wave the guy by again, not wanting to pull over in the middle of nowhere with a crazy driver on my tail. This time, a beer bottle gets thrown by these guys and smashes in the lane next to me, just behind my window.
Now I'm a bit pissed, so I ""brake check"" them a bit. The driver backs off initially, but not even 10 seconds later is back on my tail, lights on, horn blaring, and more objects being thrown (dip tins, beer bottles, general refuse). Seeing that that won't work, I light up the throttle and accelerate out of there. I can hear the truck's turbo spooling behind me and suddenly notice him picking up speed, so I was right that it was a turbo diesel.
There's a really twisty, curvy section of wooded area coming into my town, lots of deer in those woods, as well as other wildlife, so I don't feel safe going too fast when we get into this area. I slow down to just under speed limit, all the while keeping a decent speed during the turns so that the truck can't be too close. I've got AWD and a low center of gravity, as well as a decent amount of road track experience, so I keep well ahead of him.
But, as you come out of the curves, the road flattens and straightens into a two mile long straight before a few final curves into my town. I'm going about 75 when this guy flies by me, switches over with about a car length between us and slams on his brakes. Anticipating this, because I've seen enough road rage videos on Youtube, I brake, downshift, and floor it, swiftly speeding by as his truck tried to turn into my lane to cut me off. I get my phone out and call 911 as I'm driving into town and alert them, I also alert a friend of mine who runs a bar in town. He was in the IDF for four years and did tours in Yemen, Serbia, Israel, and other Middle Eastern countries. His bar is closer than my apartment, and he's a good friend who can fight with the best of them, so I tell him the situation and he says he'll be waiting at the bar and to park right up front.
As we come into town, there's a red light with a moderately busy intersection. It's night, maybe 11:00, but it's a college town, so I'm not willing to run it. I stop, constantly watching my mirrors, and so does the truck. All four doors open (extended cab, Dodge Ram with a Cummins Turbo Diesel, I know my stuff) and the occupants jump out and run toward my car. Having none of this, I floor it through the red light and make my way to the bar. As I get out, my bar owner friend and a few of his door staff are out there. The truck rumbles by about two minutes later, but doesn't stop. I've not seen it since.
To this day, I don't know what I did to draw the ire of that truck, or why it followed so closely. Maybe the occupants just hated imports, but I've never gotten hate like that before, nor am I a street racer, just an auto enthusiast who keeps to himself, mostly."
"  ex met at a bar, talked briefly, hung out, but ended things. Stayed friends until her tragic overdose","How did you respond after your ex wanted you back after leaving you?

Ran into her at a bar after 6 months of no contact while she was out with some other dude. Almost ran away from her. Had that flight response for sure. She grabbed my arm and said please talk to me. Chatted with her for 5 minutes. Left her and went to another bar and then got home where she called me and we talked till 4am. Next afternoon agreed to hang out with her and she was all over me and I was holding back. Dropped her off at her place and by some miracle didn't bang her as she got completely naked and kissing me all over (she was a smoking hot blonde with a lot of crazy). Went home to ice the boys down. Next morning I get a collect call from the county jail, it was her asking for a ride, after I left she got into a fight with her mom and assaulted her. Picked her up and told her that I can't ever hang out with you like that ever again. She nodded and I dropped her off.
Kept in touch with her since I think I was the only guy who cared for her but didn't want sex out of her for the next 6 months. She told me she was going to move to the west coast one day and I agreed to hang out with her the night before she left. She ended up crying all over me as I was dropping her off, saying how much she loved me and messed up and how she didn't ever want to lose me in her life. I promised her that I'd always be there for her.
While she was on the west coast we ended up talking on the phone on a daily basis, quite frequently. She was a great friend. One morning on the way to work I realized I didn't hear from her the night before. I called her phone and it was disconnected and I find it odd but didn't think too much of it. Get home from work and I get a phone call from a friend who was friends with her mutual friends on Facebook as I never friended her on facebook after our break up saying dude she died, she overdosed on too much booze and pills. He didn't realize that I was still talking to her on a daily basis. Fucking floored me. I thought back to that night at that bar and how I would have missed out on the last year of her life if I had ran out instead of actually talking to her and just being there for her."
  man caught ex-girlfriend cheating after a tip from her best friend. Confronted her at guy's house and left chaotic scene.,"What is the most satisfying time you’ve caught your girlfriend in a lie?

Ex told me she was sick and couldn't go out with me that night. Fine, whatever. Well, we had previously introduced her best friend to my best friend. For some reason, her best friend was mad at her that night and called me to tell me my girlfriend was cheating on me with a guy named Mike. She even told me what street he lived on.
So I drive down this street looking for her (very unique, personalized license plate) car, but don't see it. As I'm driving away, I notice there's an alley behind the houses. Sure enough, there's her car.
I go back to the front door and knock. Some dude answers and I say ""Is Mike here?""
""Yeah, he's up in his room"" pointing up the stairs by the door.
""First door on the right?""
""No, left.""
Then this dude just stands aside to let me in.
I walk up the stairs, open the door, and there's my girlfriend putting her shirt back on. ""Hey guys, what's going on?""
All she says is ""WHAT THE F!"" Dude is still in bed under the blankets. She goes into crazy bitch mode, asking me how I found her, how I got in, while this guy keeps saying ""Dude, I did NOT know she had a boyfriend! Why didn't you tell me?"" over and over (he was a ""little feller"" and at the time I was in the Army and in the best shape of my life).
The situation was so f’ed up that I just had to giggle, but quickly returned to reality and walked out before I hurt someone. The roommate that let me in, even after hearing all the commotion, was sitting there playing playstation. I nodded and said ""thanks"" as I walked out the door."
"  Maid of Honor wreaked havoc at the wedding: punching her boyfriend, engaging in sexual activity, damaging property, and facing charges.","What did that b*tch do at your wedding?

Maid of Honor at my wedding.
The ceremony went off without any problems and she was actually a huge help with setting everything up and organizing most of the day. During the cocktail hour afterwards she gets absolutely smashed and then punches her boyfriend in the face, then somehow convinces him he has been kicked out and has to leave. (I spoke to the owner and the bartenders and told them not to serve her any more alcohol at this point but they didn't think it was an issue yet.) As soon as her boyfriend is out of the parking lot she drags one of my groomsmen to bathroom and gives his skin flute a thorough cleaning.
Manages to get more drunk because she was tipping the bartender a lot. She then stumbles onto dance floor during my wife's dance with her father. I managed to stop her before any real interruption happens to the dance, but she then tries to kiss me in front of everyone, I kinda push/drop her and she hits the floor like I've shot out both her knee caps and starts crying hysterically. My mother in law runs over and drags this stupid bitch out of the reception hall all the while she is shrieking like a banshee because ""I threw her to the ground.""
Everything is good for around 2 hours while the Trash bin of honor is no where to be seen... until the owner of the golf course taps me on the shoulder and asks to speak to me outside in private. I go outside and see her boyfriend has returned, who I didn't mind seeing there because I actually liked him, but his face is panicked and he just starts apologizing for something. I was pretty drunk so it took me a few seconds to realize the tire marks all over the 9th green leading up to the golf cart about 90% submerged in the pond right beside the green. Wasn't to concerned about her dumb ass but unfortunately she was still alive and thrashing around trying to get out of the pond.
I just laughed and told the owner I wasn't paying a single cent for any damages. I told them to stop serving her hours previous and to call the police and have her charged for destroying the green and driving the cart into the pond. Surprisingly he was very understanding of my point of view and we worked together to get everything sorted out.
She ended up owing him just over 15 grand ( 8 or 9 for the cart and the rest was to fix the green and lost wages for him not being able to offer people a full 18 holes of golf.) Her parents just paid for all of it and she is currently on a ""soul searching adventure"" in Asia. Despite all this my wedding was still the most amazing day of my life and my wife actually thought most of what happened was pretty funny in a Jerry Springer dumpster donkey kind of way. I'm just glad my wife's day wasn't ruined by it and my best friend, who she blew, has one hell of a story for all of his friends about my wedding."
"  family estrangement due to blaming twins for grandmother's death: IVF conception, premature birth, mother's breast cancer, and religious beliefs clash.","What do you regret finding out? 

The real reason why half of my dad's side of the family doesn't speak to us.
We (my twin and I) were always told it was that they just weren't that close and also had some mental health issues but we learned after my dad died the truth because no one on his side of the family came to the funeral; the opted to have their own.
Turns out that my parents had trouble conceiving. This I knew. I also know me and my twin are IVF babies and we were born very premature. I'm talking 1 pound baby premature. Shortly after, my mom developed breast cancer.
What I didn't know was that during this time my dad was also taking care of his sick mother (my paternal grandmother) as well as looking after his sick wife and two newborn premies. He ended up asking his brother to help look after their mother since he'd been the one doing it so he could care for his family more.
Well soon after my dad spent more time with us vs his mom, she took a turn for the worse and died. And my father's brother blamed him for 'abandoning' the family and blamed my twin and I for the death of our grandmother. Because if we weren't born my mother wouldn't have gotten estrogen positive breast cancer and also they were all very Catholic and IVF was a sin.
I never met my grandmother. I'm named for her. But apparently an entire side of the family thinks it's mine and my sister's fault she's dead."
"  a psychiatrist recalls a disturbing case of a man suffering from sexualized OCD, plagued by distressing thoughts of pedophilia.","Psychologists, what’s the most interesting mental disorder you’ve encountered?

Psychiatrist here who's worked in high secure settings, I've dealt with serial killers, cannibals, rapists, etc, but one of the cases that stands out to me the most is an Obsessive-compulsive disorder case from training.
So for those unaware OCD has various ""forms"", this man suffering from ""sexualised"" OCD where the thoughts were of a sexual nature. The 2 most common forms are incest and paedophilic. Now to be clear these people have no desire to s x their relative or children, but are plagued by constant distressing thoughts of doing so, closer to memories than thoughts.
So this man had paedophilic OCD and had been admitted after his daughter called the police. He had been holed up in his room for months, refusing to come out, refusing to talk to people, and utterly disgusted at himself. When the police came to take him, he assumed they knew about the paedophilia and went with them. His daughter (an adult herself) asked to give him a hug as he left, he refused, citing that he couldn't bare to touch her.
When I admitted the review was one of the oddest I've had. IT was essentially an hour and half review where he said nothing. The thoughts of what he had done were so abhorrent to him, that he couldn't fundamentally bring himself to talk about them. But he desperately wanted to. So any time I tried to end the session he grappled with coming up with a reason for me to stay, desperate to tell me about these thoughts but unable to verbalise them as that would make them ""real"". Instead he continued to talk around the topic, leaving out important words like children and s x, or sitting in silence until I tried to leave and begging me to stay.
It transpired he had been wracking his mind to try and place these images of abusing children with times in his life, believing he had blacked out and committed atrocious acts on his daughters friends, and now these were memories resurfacing.
This case taught me a lot about treating psych patients, but one of the oddest points was that he was one of 3 male patients all admitted with the same thing at that time. This is far more common than people realise. IT is also part of the reason I frequently point out to people that the whole ""hang the paedo"" stance is actually counterproductive and leads to far more harm than saving kids."
"  disabled veteran shares experience of being falsely accused of domestic violence by his ex-wife, facing biased treatment from authorities.","Men what’s the worst sexism you’ve faced?

I'm a disabled veteran. I was wounded in Iraq, where I served as an infantryman during the invasion. I've been knocked around and unconscious a couple of times by mortars, IEDs, and RPG. As a result, I have ruptured disks and damaged vertebrae in my neck, at the base of my skull (C1-C3 for those keeping score at home). I've had multiple procedures and blocks over the years and am on daily medication for it.
Anyway, when my ex and I'd argue, she'd always threaten to call the cops and say I hit her because ""they always believe the woman."" I never touched her, not once. When she's get like that, I'd walk away and she'd run up and hit me at the base of the skull. She's always hit me there. I even passed out once from it. When she started that, I secretly recorded an argument where she hit me. It went like this:
""Me: I've never hit you...
Her: no
I've never threatened to hit you
No
So why do you keep hitting me. I've asked you not to. It hurts. I've told you before it hurts. STOP HITTING ME.
Ok. Sorry. It's just I get so mad when you walk away""
One day, about five months later, we argued, she makes good on her threat and calls the cops. I even play the tape of her admitting I've never hit her and that she hits me. Guess what, since she called, I got arrested. There was as much proof that it happened as there was that it didn't: my word verse hers. When I asked that at least she be charged, they refused. I'm the ""violent combat vet"" and she's the ""scared house wife."" I had no choice, I had to plead to Criminal Domestic Violence. And yes, that night was the end of our marriage."

Trazadone for sure. I was in the hospital to get my heart fixed up and was having a hard time falling asleep. To this day no one is sure exactly what happened, if I was given too much or just had a bad reaction or what. But I remember laying there and thinking something.. wasn’t right.
I got up and just kinda wandered around trying to find a nurse. I was FREEZING but pretty sweaty too and couldn’t really see or hear so well. And you know that feeling when you bang your funny bone? My whole body felt like that.
The weirdest part was I kept realizing “oh man I’m in trouble” and would start to panic but then a second later I’d sorta forget and feel so.. serene? I remember a nurse running towards me but she looked like she in slow motion, like we were underwater kinda. And I knew I had something really important to tell her but couldn’t remember what it was. All I could think was how beautiful everything was, how the light was catching her hair and her sneakers squeaking across the floor sounded like a symphony. I remember smiling at her and jus kinda slumping against the wall and then everything went dark.
I woke up hooked up to a buncha monitors with a lotta worried faces standing around. My blood pressure had dropped down to nothing and if they hadn’t found me when they did I probably woulda died. 6/10 experience, it was very beautiful but they made me chug so much yellow Gatorade and to this day that stuff makes me gag."

Well I'm not a doctor yet - but here is a story from one of my professors:
This was in rural Alabama. This middle aged married couple had presented to the ER after they had been drinking for almost the entirety of the evening and got into a heated argument. Things got heated and the woman eventually fell off the porch of their trailer into the shrubs a few feet below.
The husband in his drunken state suddenly dropped the argument and came to his wife's aid. She didn't suffer anything too too serious just a couple of scratches here and there.
Except for what the man said looked like a piece of glass or pipe or something that became lodged in the woman's arm when she hit the ground.
He decided to not come to the hospital because he could remove this object himself. He got his largest pair of pliers and gripped on to this glass/pipe looking thing lodged in his helpless wife's arm. He clamped down and pulled and pulled. Cranked and cranked. Trying to remove this object and it wouldn't budge.
After his masculinity defeated and the alcohol wearing off on both of them they decided it sensible to finally come to the ER.
Upon arriving to the ER the doctor immediately realized this poor woman had a compound fracture of her humerus, and this ""pipe or piece of glass thing"" was her bone sticking through her skin that her husband was trying to pry out with a pair of pliers."

  students exploit a computer monitoring program at school to prank their teacher and the classroom with Rick Rolling and screen mirroring.,"How did you screw with computers at your school?

My high school had a program on all the computers that would allow the teachers to watch an entire classrooms screens, take control of them, send content to them, etc...
A friend of mine came up an idea to try to use it to prank the classroom, being the r/iamverysmart 16 year olds we were. So, when my teacher wasn't looking, I put a USB stick into her computer and copied her SpyProgram.exe directory onto it to take a look at what was different between the teacher and student versions.
Turns out all you needed to make the student version a teacher version was a 25-character license key that was in a plain-text file. So, obviously, I copied it and upgraded my client to a controller using all of my teachers settings. We then proceeded to Rick Roll the classroom on full volume from 34 computers. It was pretty great.
At the end of the class we came up with a great idea. What would happen if we took control of our teachers computer and messed with her? So, we connected to her computer, but she had been watching our screen from her screen. So, for about 5 seconds we see a bottomless pit of our screen in her screen mirrors over and over and over. After about 5 seconds, our PC fans got super loud and then shut off. When we tried to turn it back on it was a black screen with only a flashing underscore in the top left corner. That PC had to be reimaged by district tech support. Still not sure what caused that.

The guests themselves were a mix of anyone from broke college kids (us) to doctors, to millionaires and billionaires. Some trends definitely emerged amongst the people who were obviously self-conscious about their wealth though.
They were frequently dismissive (and sometimes downright rude) to the serving staff. They made sure logos of their belongings were plainly in sight (your hotel room is literally connected to the reception venue, so I know you didn't need to bring your $1200 Canada Goose parka to dinner). They also made sure to talk loudly about their expensive plans for the future and highlighting any wealth-related attributes in the process (""Oh well, my girlfriend is graduating medical school next year, so we're starting to look at houses - mostly in the 800k-1mil range"").
It was a stark contrast against the people who were comfortable with their social status (wealthy or otherwise) who were all just happy to be there, having fun, drinking alcohol and wholly unworried about which stranger they'll never meet again knows how much money they had."
  a classmate's suicide attempt due to parental pressure and verbal abuse ignites anger towards their heartless treatment and expectations.,"What made you angry today?

What made you angry today? One of the happiest guys in my class attempted to commit sewerslide last night. Now, the fact that he attempted to kill himself isn’t what made me angry. It was the reason he decided to do so. As I mentioned, this was one of the happiest and most fun-loving people I’d ever met. He always had a smile plastered to his face, never in a bad mood. So as you’d imagine, the story of his attempted sewerslide came as a massive shock to us all. The reason for it was just pure cruel. We recently had some major exams (IGCSE) and he didn’t perform too well. His parents were disappointed but accepted it. Weeks after getting his results, his parents were in a bad mood and decided to take it out on their only son. His dad is a well-respected and top doctor in our country and his mum is one of the most successful lawyers around. They called him an absolute failure and disgrace to them, called him an embarrassment and said he would never get anywhere in life. That very same night he swallowed an entire bottle of painkillers and waited for death. He barely survived and is still in the hospital. I only just found out and I am absolutely seething with rage that two people could honestly do that to a person that they had given birth to, a person that loved them with all their heart. That two people could treat their own child like garbage and cause them to want to end their own life just because he didn’t achieve their expectations of him. That is what has made me angry today."
"  how social media offers endless options, making people believe there are better alternatives, leading to love fading in relationships.","What causes love to fade?

What causes love to fade? 
A month ago, I did something weird. One day I woke up being fed up with how I can’t control my eating habits, I decided not to eat for 3 days. A complete 72 hours without any kind of food. Only water. I wanted to test my willpower. This was the first time I decided to do such thing. First day, it was okay. I was hungry but not too hungry. Second day, I had trouble sleeping because of how hungry I was, but I managed to get through it. Third day, I swear I wanted to eat anything. Literally anything. I wanted to eat my pillow. But what shocked me the most was that I was craving food that I supposedly hate. Food that I couldn’t stand the smell of, suddenly I was craving it immensely. I was flabbergasted. It was expected that my survival instinct would kick in and I would want to eat anything, but I expected to crave food that I already love not food that I absolutely hate! This made me realize that I didn’t hate this food because I categorically hate it. I just had better options. My mind knows that I have other options, so I hate it compared to other food that I’d rather eat. Now getting back to your question… We can all see that divorce rates are increasing, and you can probably guess why. We’re now not limited to our own town, city or country. With the power of social media, you have access to the most beautiful women. With a quick search you can find the most successful people in the world. Suddenly you have access to people who are more beautiful and successful than your partner. Suddenly you have options. And when you have options, you get confused. Think of that burger chain which only has 1 or 2 types of burgers and the other which has a lot. It’s always easier to dine in the one with the least number of options as you don’t suffer the pain of missed opportunity. I believe this is the most contributing factor for love fading nowadays. When your partner makes a mistake, you don’t put it in the “We need to work on this” bucket, rather you put in the “That’s one more reason I could leave you for someone better” bucket. Once our mind knows that there are options, we get confused. And once we get confused, we confuse ordinary conflicts with reasons to break up. We don’t put effort into relationships as much as our parents and grandparents did. I believe it was because in their mind they didn’t have many options rather than work things out, and they did (most of them)."
"  a bus conversation: Young girl confesses to mother about being touched inappropriately. Shock, sadness, and a call for action ensue.","What’s the most heartbreaking conversation you’ve ever heard?

What’s the most heartbreaking conversation you’ve ever heard? A few years ago, I was sitting on the bus and I overheard this child and mother talking. They were discussing something to do with the kid's piano lesson - she looked about 7 or so. She was speaking clearly and normally, but as I was directly across from them on a fairly packed bus, I could tell something was weird, just from the way she was postured. She was looking directly at the ground and gripping the seat very strongly. I found this strangely bracing, like she was going to cry or something, so I started paying attention to their talk - It went like this, with her mom going: ""Are you excited to see Stephen and practice piano today?"" Kid: ""No. Yeah."" Mom: ""Haha, no and yeah? What does that mean, don't you like Stephen?"" And then I hear clear as a bell - ""Stephen won't stop touching me."" I've never watched someone go white before. The woman had a very medium-toned complexion but as soon as her daughter said this, she went very pale. I was also totally stunned- no one expected this, and many other people looked right at the girl in shock. The two things that were saddest to me was that the girl looked up from the floor and right at me first as I was in front of her, and she looked so ashamed. All sorts of awful things were racing through my mind, like who is Stephen? The instructor, probably - is he related to her? How long has this been happening? Could she mean that he just poked or teased her or something else innocent, and we're all misunderstanding? But no, the girl's face was a dead giveaway that she knew he was doing something disgraceful and dirty, not just playing. The mother yanked on the string to halt the bus and it lurched back a bit nearly missing the stop, scooping her daughter up and whispering stuff like ""don't worry"" ""we're going to get help right now"" ""when did this start?"" ""you can tell mommy this is important"" and scrambling to get up and leave. The kid looked like she broke something, like she was being a tattletail - I wanted to shout at her YOU DID THE RIGHT THING!! DON'T EVER FEEL BAD TO GET HELP! or something to shake those thoughts out of her. It felt so terrible to see her looking guilty for calling out whoever was pervertedly touching her in a place that should be safe, a school, a music lesson, how horrible is that? And the mother, I wanted to say I'm so sorry that her trust was betrayed and this gross asshole is molesting her child or worse, I wanted to offer her help and get a team to go lynch this monster or at least report him or jail him, anything! But like everyone else around me we just froze. No one said anything. We just all leaned back into our seats as they bolted off and avoided eye contact. To this day I regret not standing up and trying to help, just showing the effort that I care and this is a big deal, but I guess I didn't want to interfere in something so private, or maybe it'd only feel worse to her if some stranger tried to assist it. I don't know. I still feel conflicted about how I reacted, how everyone stood still, but I also didn't want to barge into her life without her asking me to. It made me scared and sad for children everywhere. It really woke me up that this can happen to any parent at any time - someone respected and responsible can ruin your child's life while you leave the room under the pretence of an activity or sunday school or band practice. I can't imagine how the mother and child are dealing with this today. Watching it unfold in front of me felt wrong, sad and shocking all at the same time. I feel bad that I witnessed something so personal, but at the least, the girl said something and now she's not on her way by bus to her predator anymore."

I’ve over heard a person say that their kids were out in the car so they had to leave (after being in the bar for two hours). I’ve seen old men drinking to numb themselves after losing their wife of many many years. I’ve had to serve pregnant women alcohol bc I’m not able to tell them no. I’ve served a 23 year old for hours one night when he left (walking to the bar up the street) only for him to leave that bar with a carload of friends…they wrecked. 3 died. I’ve given people rides home after closing so that they wouldn’t drive drunk. (Small town, I knew them). I’ve watched a man slowly end himself while drinking with liver failure. I’ve seen his skin slowly turn yellow, his stomach extend…until one day he don’t come in the bar anymore. A week later they found him at his house, passed away.

My husband had been married to me over 20 years by then, and knew better than I did to never question when I got that instinct. He handed me the phone to call. I wasn’t sure what to say. “Just call. You’ll figure it out”, he responded. The overwhelming feeling that something was very wrong wouldn’t let up. I called our daughter. She laughed and said everything was fine. I asked her to humor me and just go check. She said kids were asleep, so I asked her to go check the kitchen. Still chuckling at me she checked the stove and oven and declared them turned off. She looked about the rest of the kitchen until she turned in the direction facing the front doors. We have a large arctic entry so there are two front doors on each side of it so we come in from the cold and close one door and then open the second door to come to the house. “Oh my God!” She cried out, and the phone went dead. I frantically tried calling back. When she finally answered again, she told me both doors were wide open, so she called her Marine brother to come down from the upstairs apartment and he raced down. He did a security sweep of the house then the perimeter where he found evidence of bear on each side of the house. We question if the door was slightly ajar and the bear just pushed the doors open and started to come into the house until the phone rang. That same mom vibe served me well when my Marines were deployed. I always seemed to know when to pray. It got to the point that whenever there was an incident, my other Marine son said he wouldn’t worry. Even when trapped in a doorway during a fire fight for five hours… because he knew his mom “knew” and was praying. Oddly enough, he was right. Thus another story."
"  in 2009, mother's world shattered when her 4-year-old son was diagnosed with leukemia, bringing immense fear and tears.","When was the hardest you have cried?

In 2009, I was 26 years old and had a 4 year old son, and 2 year old and 1 year old little girls. My son had been sick for weeks. I'd taken him to the pediatrician every week for 4 weeks, and taken him to the ER once when he collapsed in pain and was screaming and begging me to make it stop. I was told repeatedly he had an upper respiratory, and the pain was just because he was constipated too. When he collapsed a second time, I took him back to the ER again and told them I wasn't leaving until they figured out what was happening. This time we had a different doctor, and as soon as she did her initial assessment, I could see on her face that she was concerned. She immediately got the doctor supervising the ER that day to come check him out as well, and I saw them making eye contact with each other throughout, and I knew they were very worried, although they didn't tell us what they suspected yet. They ordered bloodwork, and only an hour or so after entering the ER, they both came back and had someone come take my son to another room to color while we spoke. They asked me to sit down, and as soon as they started talking about his blood counts I started to feel like I was gonna faint. When they actually said the word “leukemia”, I started screaming and sobbing. I had forced my husband to come (he thought I was being paranoid and the previous doctors were right and it was just a virus), and I remember gripping his shirt as I screamed and wept. I had no experience with cancer, and as far as I knew, my 4 year old little boy could be facing a death sentence. I had always seen the St Jude ads, and listened to the stories on the annual telethon on the radio, and used to cry hearing the parents talk about losing their children. I remember pulling over and praying that my children never be that sick as I cried for those kids. My baby going through that was my worst fear, and it was suddenly coming true. I cried a lot during his treatment (never in front of him), but that first evening was shattering for me. And a side note: Cancer is NOT a death sentence, that was just what my inexperience and fear told me at the time. My precious little boy is now a healthy 12 year old who's about to pass my height. He had a difficult 3 years, but he is now healthy and cancer free."
"  a man's 23-year-old testicular lump led to ejacufarting into wife's eye, jeopardizing her LASIK surgery. Surprisingly, lump wasn't cancerous.




","Today I effed up by ignoring a lump on my balls for 23 years and ejacutooting into my wife’s eye, almost ruining her LASIK surgery 

Every once in a while, something happens so preposterous, so outside the realm of possibility, that you know no one will ever believe you. That’s happened to me three times. Once, I saw a squirrel disappear into thin air. Once, I saw a disembodied hand cross a road in the dead of night. And once, I ejacufarted into my wife’s eye. Let’s travel back 23 years ago. I was 14 and had just learned about doing self checks of my testicles for lumps. And, lo-and-behold, I found one. I was pretty worried, told my parents, and eventually went to a urologist. He examined the lump and told me it was a varicose vein. The doctor didn’t do much to verify this other than squeezing the lump a few times. But, he told me not to worry about it and said that at worse there was about a 3% chance I couldn’t have kids. So, I went about my life not worrying about it. About six months ago, my wife was going ham on ham, giving me an “ol’ fashioned,” if you will. We’ve been together for…wow, 19 years! So farting in front of each other during intercourse wasn’t a big deal. At best, it was funny, and at worse, nothing to really react to. So there I was, enjoying myself, but not anywhere near climaxing, when I farted. And when I say farted I mean I ejacufarted. By which I mean the fart caused me to ejaculate, hard, with no organism. My wife was caught off guard, and my kum hit her in the eye. She had had LASIK about three months before hand and, while she was well past the healing stage, she was adamant about not rubbing her eyes anymore for the rest of her life. Something about detached retinas? Anyway, back to the ejacufarting. So, I figured this was a one-off incident, but the next time I had to fart during a private, personal session, I forced the fart out and the same thing happened. And then again when I tried again a bit later. I assumed this wasn’t normal, so, 23 years after that first visit, I found myself back at the urologist. And this time, they looked more closely at what was going on down there, MRI and all. And, as it turns out, that lump on my left ball wasn’t a varicose vein, but part of a complex of soft tissues which didn’t belong there, and which, apparently, linked my bulbocavernosus muscle and pubococcygeus muscle, and probably other shit too. It’s not cancer, more a one-in-a-million medical oddity. Why it would cause this ejacufarting phenomenon only now is a mystery, unless I had literally never farted while having a boner before that moment in my entire life. Anyway, my wife’s eye is okay, and so am I, I guess. I don’t seem to be in any immediate danger anyway according to my doctors. Oh, and I can have kids! I just hope that none of them were conceived by an ejacufart. I’ve definitely farted while inside of her before."
"  man breaks up with Holocaust-denying girlfriend due to her far-right conspiracy beliefs, including denial of Sandy Hook shooting.




","My girlfriend is a holocaust denier

The title is as simple as it sounds: My girlfriend doesn't believe that the Holocaust actually happened. She's of the belief that it was all a liberal/socialist piece of propaganda coordinated by FDR and his administration in order to make us feel sorry for Jews. She claims that FDR founded the ""alt-left"" and his influence is slowly leading into Jews taking over our country to this day. So...this is some pretty white nationalist type of thinking, no? I mean, I care about my girlfriend, but this revelation is really changing my perspective on her. We've formed such a healthy relationship before all of this. Our one year anniversary is coming up in October, but I really don't know where to go with the reveal that she believes these things. Do I simply ignore these beliefs and continue going strong with our relationship, or is it time to cut ties? As of this morning, my holocaust denying girlfriend is officially my holocaust denying EX-girlfriend. It wasn't easy to do considering how me and this girl connected in the past, but it was something that I knew had to be done. Before I go into detail about the actual break up, I want to address some of the comments from my original post regarding her other beliefs. Before I talked with her about breaking up this morning, I asked her some of her other thoughts on certain issues, one of them being the Sandy Hook shooting. She actually does believe that Adam Lanza went on a shooting spree at the school and killed all of those children and teachers, but she believes that he was a mere pawn in a false flag operation conducted by Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and the Obama family. Not just Barack, but Michelle and Barack's father who, according to her, is an undercover Kenyan warlord who's involved in some deal that makes him money at the expense of Americans losing their guns. As far as her other beliefs, they're pretty typical far-right conspiracies. She thinks vaccines cause autism, Obama was born in Kenya, 9/11 was perpetrated by Israel, and Hillary Clinton runs a intercourse slave operation in the basement of a pizza shop. When I asked her where she gets her information, she didn't go into specifics, but all she said was ""a website run by true Americans"". When it came to the actual break up, I gave her an ultimatum. Either she does legitimate research on these topics and opens up her mind to real facts instead of unreliable far-right websites, or we break up, simple as that. She immediately told me to ""get effed by a Jew"" and said that no amount of evidence will ever change her beliefs. So, I blatantly told her then and there that we're breaking up and that's that. As far as her reaction goes, she started to scrunch up her face like she was about to cry, but that look was gone and replaced by one of anger. She started telling me off for being brainwashed by our ""liberal media"" and ""fake news"". Just typical far-right, Trump supporting nonsense, but then she said something that actually made me laugh: She said that she was going to start writing a book about our relationship and how much of a ""cuck"" I am. As soon as I stopped laughing at that response, I told her that she'll find someone else to date at the next ""Unite the Right"" rally and I saw myself out. I know this subreddit is solely for advice and I know that I'm not asking for any in this post, but I just thought it necessary to give an update considering how my post garnered a bigger response than I was expecting. Honestly, I knew before making the post that I was eventually going to break up with her for having such despicable beliefs, I just felt it necessary to at least see what other people had to say about the situation. Thanks for reading, and here's hoping my next girlfriend isn't completely effing crazy."
"  step-sister frames younger brother, provoking intense anger in narrator. Narrator confronts and threatens step-sister, ending her bullying. No regrets.","Bratty stepsister framed my baby brother. AND I SNAPPED 

At first I posted it on r/EntitledBitch but some thought it would fit nicely here, enjoy the the quick revenge :) Until 3 years ago, I lived at both of my parents, one week at my mom's and one week at my dad's. 10 years ago, so literally less than a year after the divorce, he was living with his new girlfri (whom he was NOT going out with before he left my mom... yeah right). Said woman got 2 kids, two horrible entitled brats but I kind of pity them because it's their mom's fault if they're like that. Anyway, back then I was still living with my dad, his entitled/narcissist girlfri and her spawns of hell. The youngest, who was 8 yrs then, is even worst than her brother and she did not get better growing up. When you imagine the cliché high school bitchy bully girl, you see her. She was spoiled rotten by her mom and she believes she's entitled with everything. The worst is that she's actually really pretty, academic wise she is doing remarkably well, she's popular and she is captain of her school's basketball team. Now, don't get me wrong, I have nothing against achievements or successful people. But I do hate people who have everything in life and feel like they have to rub it in others faces and make them feel miserable. When this story happened she was just 8 yrs old but she was already a pain. What happened is she waited for the parents to be gone for a romantic dinner/evening (leaving me as a babysitter, back then I was like 13-14 and had to watch 3 kids and needless to say I wasn't paid). Everything was going okay, she and her brother did try to trigger me but I had figured it's better to just ignored them. My little brother was in the basement playroom, building legos. About 10 minutes before the parents got back (we knew because they called to tell us they were about to get home) the shitty brat trashed her bedroom, knocked her own arm on her bed post to get a mark and hid her saved up money in my brother's room. When the parents arrived, the show (and the crocodile tears) started. She was crying and wailing that my brother hit her and stole her money. They went to my brother's room, found the money and my little brother got badly grounded and he wasn't given a single chance to explain or def himself. Much later that same night, I was in my little brother's room trying to comfort him but what do you want to say to a little kid who believes his father doesn't love him? Then... the little bitch creeped in and with the worst smug grin ever, told me what she did. She said (I remind you she was 8 back then): ""Soon your dad is gonna s you away to live with your stupid slutty mom. I can't wait to see you two retarded effers get out of MY house."" And she left. I was furious beyond words. The next day... when we kids got back home from school and the parents were still at work. I was doing the dishes of the morning because my stepmom and her kids never cleaned up after themselves. The little brat came by and complained about how ""lousy a maid"" I was and she said: ""you're almost as retarded and useless as your brother"" she almost spat the last word and taunted me saying that it was just a matter of time before my dad sent him to an asylum for ""retarded people like him"" as she said. Listen, I'm not a violent person but I couldn't stand it anymore. I grabbed her by the collar of her shirt, slammed her against the wall and took up a knife to her throat and said: ""Listen to me you little bitch. I am DONE with your shit. You wanna pick on somebody? FINE! Come after me! But if you ever do something to my little brother, if you ever insult, hurt or frame him ever again... I WILL end you! And don't worry, I don't care about going to jail, if it means the world is rid of the waste of a human you are! My life is HELL as it is and my little brother is the one good thing I got left and I'll be DAMNED if I let you torment him. GOT IT?!"" and I pressed the knife more on her throat, enough to hurt but not enough to draw blood. She was petrified, her eyes wide with pure terror. It was the first time, and the last, that she saw me angry. She never bullied my brother after that, or me for that matter. And she never told the parents. Every once in a while, while doing the dishes, I'd grab a knife and smile at her. I told my brother years later... and he told me he knew I had done something because (okay, proud sista moment): ""You've always protected me, I don't need a shitty dad when I got a superhero for a big sister!"" I cried. AND I REGRET NOTHING
"
  grandpa sacrifices his remaining time to seek revenge on behalf of his grandchild who suffered abuse and trauma.,"Grandpa gave up what time he had left for revenge on my behalf.

I grew up dealing with alot of mental health issues, as my mother is a drug addict and my father liked to ignore my Exsistence as im the result of a one night stand while he was married, so needless to stay his wife hated me and there children treated me horribly as well. The only good people i had in my life was my grandma and grandpa on my fathers side, i loved them and spent alot of time at my grandpas buisness (ill explain that a little later) Now at 14 everything went further down hill, i wont go into details but my mother almost passed away and i met a man lets name him goat (he looked like one) long story short goat was 25 at the beginning and emotionally, physically and s xually hurt me. While i was under the precent that i loved him and it was okay. He pushed me away from my grandparents and isolated me for two years until a friend helped me get out of it. During this next year goat stalked me, threatened me and had me absolutely terrified. I was afraid of going to the police as i didnt want to bring harsh light to my grandpas buisness, and because i was afraid. I was staying at my friends house for a while during this time, as my panic attacks and what i now know is ptsd was horrible and i hated to be alone. During this time my grandmother passed away, one of the only lights in my life left. So i became worse, i began drinking and going to parties and trying to forget my life. Right before my 18th birthday goat made a real life appearance again, on my way back from a big party he jumped me, beat me black and blue and almost ended me. I was found and taken to hospital where they began treating me and as i was underage they asked me to call an adult in my life that they could talk to. I tried to call my father but he didnt pick up, knowing my mother wasnt going to help i had to call my grandfather, he was at the hospital in lightning speed and for the first time in my life i watched this man that had built his own empire really break down, even at my grandmas funeral he didnt cry. I spent two months in hospital, with police questioning me and my grandpa by my side everyday. During this time he met my friend who helped me out of it all at the beginning and became very close to him. My grandfather helped me get on my feet for a whole year, until one day he had a large family gathering and socialized the whole time, taking me with him, that night i will never forget, we went to get icecream and then he just hugged me for a very long time, holding me tight and reassuring me everything would be okay. The next day my grandpa exacted his revenge. Now my grandpa was the owner of a well off law firm that also had private detectives in a smaller office in his building. He apparently tracked down goat and went about his revenge. My grandpa shot goat three times in the stomach and once in the chest. Goat passed away in the hospital later that day while my grandpa was taken in and soon put in jail for manslaughter which he pleaded guilty to. I never got the chance to visit my grandpa in jail as he passed away soon after in jail from complications. One week after my grandpas death i got a call from his solicitor. And he asked me to go in, i was met with a lengthy letter from my grandpa, which was nothing but loving and showed that he had found out he had terminal lung cancer and wouldnt live much longer, but he couldnt happily leave me alone in this world without goat being gone too. My grandpa left almost EVERYTHING to me. At 20 i would inherit the lawfirm and could do as i pleased with it and i inherited 95% of his savings, his house he lived in with grandma and his other assets. Incase anyones intrested, i turned 21 last week, im currently working at the lawfirm, my grandpas secretary (now the ceo) has taken over the important things in the building and makes most of the decisions. I spent half the money i was given in locked saving funds for all of the younger family members to go to college when its time. I cut all contact off with my father who tried to steal money from me during the death arrangements of grandpa. My friend mentioned earlier in the story is now my fiance and we are getting married next summer. Im still suffering from ptsd and depression, but its getting better everyday, im in therapy for my ptsd treatment. I got a tattoo for my grandpa and grandma on my back of two lions protecting a cub. I also opened up a safe house for anyone going through abuse of any kind. No matter the race, gender or age im trying to help anyone i can in that situatuion. Besides for what ive put away for later in life im also thinking of opening up the bakery i always wanted and employing the people that need the job and help the most, but im unsure at the moment about that. My grandpa and grandma was a god send and to this day i miss them greatly but i know i couldnt have changed the stubborn old mans mind even if i tried."
"  person won lawsuit against boss for firing after requesting a day off for a concert, received six months of pay.","I sued my boss because he fired me for wanting to attend a concert. Good afternoon everybody that stumbled on this post! 

First up, some backstory, During my gap year between studies I decided to work for Company N. Company N was run by a husband (Dave) and wife (Karen) with their son and basically treated their staff like a small familiy. All was well for about 2 months, until I realized I had to ask for a day off since I wanted to attend the last Slayer concert the band would give in my country. There was about a month to go, so I sent an Email asking for the day off and explaining why. This is where everything started to go downhill. I got a reply from the Karen and her reply was... weird. She stated thats not how asking for a day off works. I was confused to say the least. Not sure what to do I thought she wanted a more formal way of asking, so I wrote a formal email asking for the day off. She shot an email back I really had to think it through what I was doing. Which made even less sense to me! But I was hopefull since I never really got a specific: ""No"" The next workday rolls around. I arrived, lock up my bike and headed inside ready for work. I immediately started looking for Dave to ask for answers. Before I could even open my mouth he asked me: ""Do you still want to go to that concert?"" I didnt expect him to ask this so quickly answered: ""Yes"". The only thing he said back was: ""Okay, take off your vest and you can go home."" I was stunned, And while the words started to sink in I looked at my colleagues which were just preparing for opening. When it finally sank in anger flowed in. I am not a confrontal person so I simply took off my vest and gave it to Dave. Without a word I left and started biking home. When I got back home I told my mother what happened. We started sending Emails for extra information and got very karen-like emails back. After a couple emails which went basically nowhere, I looked up the laws for immediate dismissal. After reading up about it I learned that (in my country) somebody can only be immediately fired when: caught stealing, frauding, the person isn't able to do the work or refusal to do the work. I did neither of these. A day or two later I met with my attorney and began the steps to sue Company N. I told my lawyer what happened in detail and he was very confident I was in my right and she was not. So after trading even more emails between the three of us we went to small claims. I came prepared in a suit with my attorney in tow. And Karen showed up... alone. I guess she assumed she won because she thought she was in her right. The trial began and I was as professional and objective as I could be, Karen did the same. Well, for about half of the trial. When she realized evidence was piling up against her she resorted to calling me a spoiled brat among other things I don't know the english translation for. I'm safe to say that was the point the judge ruled in my favour. As per usual I had to wait a month before I got the verdict black on white in the mail, but I won! It may have taken about 6 months from the moment I was told to go home to the point those 6 months of pay were transferred to my bank account. But it was 100% worth it! In the end I went to the concert, It was the most awesome and most profitable concert I have ever been too in my life!"

I make art as a hobby. Metal sculptures. I only sell them when I need a bit of money for something. I had a holiday coming up so listed one here on TradeMe (an auction site) for a $1 reserve. The auction lasted 10 days and the piece got quite a bit of interest in that time with lots of people adding it to their watchlist and bidding on it. It ended up selling for a bit over $500. Perfect. I contacted the winner with my bank details and ask for their delivery address. No reply. Email again. Nothing. I look into his profile a bit and sure enough he doesn't follow through on half things he buys. Fair few grumpy feedbacks from other sellers. He's a complete Time Waster (TW). Hmmm I'm a bit pissed. I've already had to pay a listing fee, advertising fees and $40 success fee (I'll eventually get this back but still annoying) and being in limbo on a deal sucks. You kind of expect the money and kind of don't at the same time. Got me raging. I google his email, nothing. I check if he has any listings for sale, he doesn't atm. Besides give him bad feedback there's not really much I can else I can do right now. I add him as a favorite seller. This way next time he lists something I'll get emailed about it but he never does. About a year later, after I'd forgotten all about it, I get a bunch of emails from Trademe telling me TW has new listings. Seems TW is packing up shop and moving to Australia. Seems everything has got to go mate. Ironically, his listing states that everything must be picked up by end of August as I'm moving to Australia, NO TIME WASTERS. He's got listings for a car, motorcycle, tools, a welder, some furniture, rims and a bunch of other stuff. I give his feedback another quick look to see if he's changed his ways. He hasn't. Over the following week I research what a good price would be for everything he lists. I share all his listings with my friends and get them to add his listing to their watchlist so he thinks they are popular. Insruct them to go into a bidding war with me on each item up to a certain amount but no further. I win all of his auctions using a bunch of false accounts. Lucky guy gets top dollar for everything. I reply all the auction winning email confirmations from the various accounts arranging different pick up times for the goods agreeing to paying cash on pickup for everything. As the week goes on I cancel, reschedule, rain check and delay every pick up. Bearing in mind I'm pretending to be a different person for each item from different SIM cards. On the day at arrange to pick up the car (it had been agreed previously that he could continue to use his car up until two days before leaving for Australia because I'm a nice guy like that) I text him that I'm on my way, see you at 1. I was late of course. ' nearly there mate see you soon' half an hour later ' 5 minutes away'  20 minutes later 'I'm here where are ya?' Ignore the text messages and waited for the call. TW: Where are ya Me: Annoying isn't it TW: What? Me: Annoying isn't it Tw: What do you mean. Me: You know. Having someone bid on your auction with no intention of buying it. TW: Are you f ing kidding?!!! Me: No, I remember being quite annoyed when you did it to me. TW: Who?when? ME: I'll let you figure that one out.  Click Over the next few hours I called him as the welder buyer 'Annoying isn't it', the motorbike buyer 'Annoying isn't it', outdoor furniture buyer 'Annoying isn't it' ... all of them. To top it off I gave him positive feedback on everything I bought saying he was a 'Top Trader A+++, easy pick up, good communication"". In the coming weeks I was contacted by Trademe regarding his dispute (he was wanting to get the success fees back, over $500 altogether I'd guess) I responded to each of those with the fact that I had already paid and picked it up and was happy with the item. Not sure if he got all those success fees back but I very much doubt it."
"  an employee deals with a lunch thief by ""poisoning"" their food, leading to the thief's firing from the company.","A coworker was eating people's lunches so I ""poisoned"" them and got them fired.

 So I like to bring my own food into the office and we have a fridge to put things into, and I have my food in tubs with my name on them. A coworker would sometimes 'not see' people's names on food and think it was theirs, so would heat it up and eat it and then apologise. They did this enough for it to be an annoyance but not enough for our employers to really care. This has been happening with my food for once or twice a month. Last month I had enough and I like spicy food, but don't bring it into the office as sometimes I'll let people try some of my food and my cooking. I ordered a bag of ""Ghost Chilli Peppers"" And put the full bag into a big pot of chilli that would last for several days. I took this into the office and had it for lunch every day. Midweek my lunch went missing and I was waiting for the person who was stealing my lunch get a shock when they ate my lunch. What happened in reality was someone got sent home sick, and the next day they were off and I was told they went to the doctors for stomach pains. Two weeks went by and the coworker who was off refused to talk about it and said HR was involved so I knew they were going to try get me fired. I went home and ordered another bag of Ghost Chilli's and made another batch of my chilli, this time with only one chilli in a single tub. I put this In the freezer and the following Monday I was told I had a HR meeting that day. I refused and said they need to give me 24 hours to find someone to come into the meeting with me and the next day I had my manager come into the meeting and brought in my (now heated) Ghost Chilli infused Chilli. The long and short is I was told I could be fired for trying to poison the person who was stealing my lunch, and I asked if they admitted to stealing people's lunch, which they did. I then said I have a batch of the chilli in question with me, and I like spicy food. My liking spicy food shouldn't stop me from having it at work since it doesn't smell when heated (like fish) and my manager agreed it was on the person who took my lunch without knowing how spicy it was, and I should not be held liable if they eat something of someone else's that doesn't agree with them. My manager and I then ate some of the chilli and offered it to the other people in the meeting, some of which tried it and agreed while it was spicy it was clearly what I liked as I was fine eating it. The meeting ended and nothing happened. I wasn't taken into another meeting and my lunch wasn't taken anymore, but the person who had stole our lunch got a slap on the wrist and was allowed to stay at work. Lunches started to go missing again so my manager went to HR to say that lunch's we're going missing and he knew who was taking it and had proof this time, and when they asked for the proof he presented the meeting record with the line highlighted where they admitted they had stolen lunch and the line where HR had said this was not what the meeting was about. They were fired the next day for ""Theft of property"" and told they would not be given a reference."
"  man mistakenly accuses girlfriend of being in spicy videos, but it turns out to be a vivid dream.","TIFU by finding my GF's spicy videos and confronting her about it.

Basically me and my GF of almost 3 years now are in a long distance relationship due to us both being in college. We're both from the same hometown so during summer we can see each other freely because we both come home to work. Long Distance is hard as hell, so summer is a great time for us to bang like Catholics to make up for the time we spent apart. Fortunately she's on the pill so we don't have to use condoms. Great right? Wrong.
Last night we were hanging out and were going to get busy, but she ended up getting a headache and as a result wasn't in the mood. I went home with blue balls, and decided that I was tired too and just wanted to sleep it off. After going in and out of sleep, I eventually decided that I needed to get off, and ol' reliable would have to do.
I loaded up the hub and started browsing through the videos until I found one of those casting tapes that looked good enough for me. I got the lotion ready and lathered up my meat scepter, but stopped to do a double take. The girl in the video looked like my girlfriend. Exactly like my girlfriend. I was thinking ""Oh cool this is basically like beating it to moving piocs"", and began to jack it.
But once the f ing started, my heart stopped. She had the same birthmark as my GF did, same spot below her butt, same shape and everything. This wasn't a look alike, this WAS my girlfriend. I grabbed my earbuds to plug in, and sure enough, it was her voice speaking to the camera explaining how she was doing this because she needed money for college.
I checked below the video title and saw that it linked the actors/actresses and saw her screen name. I was hesitant, but clicked on it. Turns out this wasn't a one time quick cash deal, because on my screen I was looking at page after page, video after video of my GF being railed by giant meat. My girl wasn't as innocent as I thought. She was an internet star.
I was so f ing torn right then. So many feelings started running through my brain. It now made sense why she suddenly decided to go on the pill last year without really having a reason. She was always complaining about money so this made sense why she would do it.
I then started freaking out about STDs. None of the videos had the guys using condoms and several were creampies. We were both each other's firsts so once she was on the pill we ditched condoms because we knew neither of us had anything, but now I was terrified I had been duped. Not to mention we had been plowing like crazy over the past few months, so my worries were heightened because this was very much recent. I realized that it was late enough that I couldn't do anything so I went to bed again.
I woke up the next morning in cold sweats. I was angry, pissed, and emotionally a wreck. I sent a text to my girlfriend calling her a slut and a liar and everything in the book I could think of. I called up my doctor's office and scheduled an STD test. Fortunately they could take me right then so I drove over.
After the tests were finished, I got a text from my girlfriend. ""What the eff are you talking about???"". I was even angrier than before. That little bitch was gonna act dumb about it? I was furious, but I had evidence. She wasn't gonna get out of this one without some explaining.
I fired up the hub again to find the videos, but I couldn't find the casting one I started on last night. No worries, I remember her stage name. I typed it into the search bar, again surprised by what I found. Not because I was looking at her being railed by other dudes again, but because the videos weren't there. They didn't exist.
Now I was just f ing confused. I tried other spicy websites, but came up with the same results: nothing. I knew I saw them last night tho, so I knew they were there though, right?
And that's when the realization hit. Remember how I said I was drifting in and out of sleep before getting up to jerk it? It was all a dream. A very bad dream. My brain decided that a great dream to have would be my Girlfriend being an internet star, forcing me to watch her bang other dudes.
So here I am explaining to my girlfriend like an idiot how I had a dream she was an internet star without my knowledge, apologizing for all the names I called her, and sitting in awe at how badly this could've turned out. Fortunately she seems to be mostly understanding of this, so I think we're good for now."
"  a teen's martial arts class disrupted by disrespectful child. Altercation ensues, resulting in ban, but later lifted due to declining membership.","I Permanently Disabled Karen’s Son.

Before I start this story, I have to add a bit of backstory. I am a 19yr old male and when I was younger (around 14) I used to do Taekwondo classes, I was a black belt at the time and I really enjoyed it. We had a few incidents where parents would take there aggressive kids into classes for a free trial but they where mostly delt with by the instructor, but nothing makes my blood boil like this incident.
I did Taekwondo on every Tuesday and Thursday for around an hour. While on Thursdays I was in an age requirement class which was 13+ so most kids had common sense and it was tougher than Tuesday’s which had no age requirement and I was helping the instructor teach as I had done training for it which helped me with getting a job because I was planning on working in a place like that. So one Tuesday afternoon (10 minutes after the class had started) a Karen runs up the stairs making a ruckus with her whining  kid (who looked around 7). The instructor lets me know that I’ll take over for awhile as he goes and assists the Karen and her kid. While I’m showing the class (who were mostly young kids around 7-9) how to do a certain punch, the kid bursts through the door and runs straight over to the punching bags. He proceeds to push me over (as I was crouching) and start punching the bag. I stand up immediately and say to the kid in a semi-unhappy tone “hey you can’t be doing that to others” He immediately stopped punching the bag and says I kid you not “F*** off you c**t” I stare in shock at the kid who was younger than most people in the room that was using language that I wouldn’t even use on my worst day. The kid then skips away like nothing happened. While still in shock I continue the class as I would tell the instructor after he returned about the incident. I look over to the kid who was saying something to his Karenm (which I assume was about me) while she was purchasing a uniform. She stops and looks over to me in pure disgust then says something to the instructor who had a confused look. That’s when another kid grabbed my arm and asked for my help with a punch. I gladly go over and help him to get out of that situation.
About 10 minutes later the kid comes out of the toilets wearing a uniform with a wet stain on it already (which we can all agree on what it was) and he proceeds to start talking to the other kids about his Minecraft world. Luckily the instructor overheard this and went over to tell the kid to listen or sit out. In which he replies “Fineeeeeee” The instructor informs me that he will take over again and I should put the punching bags back. I do as he says and then go grab a drink and sit down while waiting for him to call for me in a demonstration. In which he does for a certain hair grab escape. After the demonstration, the class partners up and does it with each other in which the kid comes up to me with the biggest grin on his face and asks if he can be my partner. I reluctantly agree as he pulls my arm while running into a spot and he says he wants to grab my hair first. I knew exactly what he was going to do but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. He then grabs my hair with his full force, laughs and pulls me in which I respond by kicking the back of his leg so he would fall over (onto a mat). When he fell he decided not to let go of my hair but to pull me down with him in which he had pulled some of my hair out. After that I yelled at him saying “WHY IN THE HLL WOULD YOU DO THAT! When his Mom looks over and says to me “YOU LITTLE ST! GET THE F OFF MY SON YOU WEIRDO!” I start to stand up while holding my head and the kid starts yelling he “can’t feel his leg” The mom comes and wacks me straight in the face with her handbag as the instructor comes up and yells at us to get out in which I grab my bag and walk out the door with a giant bruise on my face as I wait for the bus, a car pulls up to me and its none other than the Karen and kid themselves. Karen says to me “you will be hearing from us very soon my son is “permanently disabled” and you will pay for all of the bills, she then grabs a full water bottle and throws it at me, then speeds off while her kid is grinning at me.
Fast forward a couple days later and I receive an email from my Taekwondo class saying I’m banned from the place for badly injuring a child and that I would not receive a refund for the rest of the years classes. I’m writing this story because I was recently unbanned from the place as the company is running short on members and is going to shut down if they can’t keep up."
"  a single father defends his transgender son after sister deadnames him at her wedding, choosing to leave rather than tolerate bigotry.","My Sister Deadnamed My Son, I wasn’t going to let that slide.

I'm a 45yro single father of three. Theur mom died 10 years ago. I have 3 sons, 17yro Andrew, 15yro Connor and 14yro Max. Connor was born female, he is trans. He came out as trans 5 years ago, and has now socially transitioned, not yet phisically.
My sister (38F) just got married. Me and my sons were also invited. My family has known that Connor is trans for 2 years now, some have adjusted well, some not so much. My sister is pretty indifferent about it.
Her wedding was really super well organised to the last detail. She wanted all the men to wear shirt+tie and then women sundresses. I textednher a picture of our outfits the day before the wedding, and she said ""where's Nia's dress?"". I was a bit surprised and told her not to deadname my son and that he'll be wearing a shirt and tie like the rest of men there or we aren't coming. She said ""fine"" and that was it.
At the reception, my sister got mad that Connor was wearing a tie, but didn't say much after that. When we sat down at our table, the card ""Nia"". I went to my sister and she said she used ""their real name"". I told her me and the boys are leaving and she told me ""don't you dare cause a scene at MY WEDDING, Nia can be a guy any other day"". I called her a bigot and we left.
My family says I ruined her wedding."

I overheard a woman asking a man to kill her husband. First and only time I told my wife to shut up. She knew I was listening to someone in the booth behind me. I didn't believe what that woman said. I had to look at the guy. I didn't know how yet so I stood up and removed my sweatshirt and looked at him. He knew I heard and he winked. What the hell did that mean? He's got to be a cop. Or is he not? Dilemma here.
I proceeded to the bathroom to call the police. This was a cop and he knew. I had my phone out to dial the police and he walks in and shows me his badge. I HAD to study it. It was real, but now I'm thinking it's stolen. We talked fast. He said, ""Trust me, don't ruin this. I got her on tape. You're on the tape now, too. Watch when we leave."" I'm stunned at this point.
Long story short, he paid for their meal and as they left, she was converged on in the parking lot and arrested. Damn, my own personal

"  late grandpa played video games in secret, earning in-game money for grandkids. Heartwarming gesture discovered posthumously. Fondly missed.




","Just found out my late grandpa would play video games while my cousin and I weren't there when we were little so that we would have more in-game money when we would come over.

My grandparents had a laptop at their house that we were allowed to play video games on, which was a big deal for my cousin and I because neither of us really had computers we were allowed to play games on at home. Every Wednesday, when we would go over to their house for dinner, my cousin and I would go into the office and play video games together on the computer. The games we were playing weren't that complicated (think Webkinz, Poptropica, that kind of thing), and we were young, maybe from the age of 6 to maybe 10, but practically every Wednesday the ritual was the same: eat dinner, escape into the office, and play video games.
Our grandpa loved playing them with us. He didn't do everything with us, but whenever there was a difficult level, a hard puzzle, or even technical issues, he would always come back to the office and was happy to help us. He was the one that set up those accounts for us, and he kept the passwords in his fireproof safe in case we ever lost or forgot them.
But today I found out from the same cousin (who only just found out from his Mom, my aunt) that whenever we would be gone for the rest of the week, he would spend his free time each evening playing those little minigames that earn virtual money within the games we played just so when we came back we would have extra money to spend in the game. Now keep in mind that he worked a 9-5 job, and though he was always around enough, it's not like he was retired and trying to find ways to kill time. We were young, and I'm absolutely sure that we never noticed, but I'm also sure we took full advantage of the magical currency that would appear in our inventory when we would get there on Wednesday evening.
Our grandpa died three years ago next Saturday, and Christmas is always hard because it was the time of year where he absolutely lit up as a person and went all out in terms of decorations, gifts, and such. I know he cared about us and loved us, but this little gesture that I had absolutely no idea about just makes his memory so much better. I miss him like hell."
"  a woman murdered her lover's wife, marrying him later. The daughter knew but was disbelieved, living with the truth for years.","What is the scariest true story you know?

Another woman fell in love with my great grandfather, and he was already married to my great grandmother. so she came to their home with a gun while he was at work. when my great grandmother opened the door, she shot her point blank. however, my grandmother, then 3(ish) years old, was behind her, watching everything. i guess she concluded that she wouldn’t remember, or wouldn’t be believed, or simply couldn’t shoot a child, being a mother herself... and thankfully didn’t shoot her. this was around 1930, forensics weren’t very advanced. no evidence was left. the case goes cold.
life continued on and eventually the woman, named Lorraine, got what she wanted. she convinced my great grandfather to marry her. she had 2 children from a previous marriage, both older than my grandmother. i don’t know what happened to her first husband, honestly.
she told everyone exactly who murdered her mother, but no one believed her. who would believe a kid who obviously misses her mother, and is having trouble adjusting to her new family? people just thought she demonized her stepmother for replacing her mom. or maybe imagined it. it’s an easy conclusion to reach, honestly.
and so years and years pass, she grows up with her mother’s murderer in her own house. sleeping rooms away. and Lorraine knows that she knows. she appears like the perfect housewife, swooping in and caring for the grieving father and child. my grandmother grows up tormented by her and her children. there was obvious favoritism, the stepkids are spoiled and she’s the black sheep of the family.
she moves out and marries my grandfather the first chance she gets. she moves on and has children of her own. 5 boys. Lorraine became ill and finally landed on her deathbed. and there, she finally confessed to the truth, and told everyone what she had done. i guess she was worried about the state of her soul.
57 years had passed since the murder. 16 since my great grandfather had passed. he never knew the truth. no documents were ever officially amended to state that she was the murderer, as far as i know. the authorities consider the case cold, still, almost 100 years later.
it drives me nuts that my grandmother ALWAYS KNEW! and even after she was an adult, people just said oh, you had an active imagination as a child. there’s no way. to live with that knowledge for so long... and have no one in the world on your side. your whole family against you. that’s what scares me."
"  in their childhood, they frequently played games of tying up playmates, indicating a potential interest in bondage and dominance.","What is something you did as a child that turned out to be an indicator of your future personal sexual preferences?

Lots of tying up playmates. Like, lots of it. I always played the bad guy that captured the princess/school teacher/missionary/nun/whatever and tortured them until they told me everything.
What's amazing to me is that my ""victims"" always wanted to play games like that. It wasn't like I was the only one ever to suggest it.
And it may relieve you to know that the absolute worst torture I ever devised (back then anyway) was tickling and using imaginary whips. Mind you, once the play group got old enough, that tickling was less tickly and more about seeing where the boundaries were.
There was this other boy that insisted on being the hero. Which lasted a few weeks until he decided to ""lose"" while trying to rescue whoever the victim of the day was. One of my imaginary swords disarmed his imaginary sword, and he decided that he should take the place of the victim.
Which was fun too because after the first time he complained he couldn't see me hitting him with the whip and said I should go cut down a vine and whip him ""for reals, but like, not hard"".
A few weeks after that, it was a fairly common thing that the victim would refuse to leave the side of her hero. So noble!
So, I go to ask my dad for more rope. He asked what the hell I needed rope for. ""Well, the princess got rescued, but I got the knight this time and couldn't tie them both up"".
He cut me off six feet of rope.
Damn, the eighties were a different time lol.
Basically, sticks and stones may break my bones, but whips and chains excite me."
"  how zaza's downsides include addictive tendencies, dulling of emotions, existential feelings, feeling stuck in life, increased tolerance, and loss of motivation.","What are the downsides of zaza that people don't talk about ?

I smoked everyday for about 10 years, minus about 6 months in all that as I needed to be clean for a drug test for a job. In my opinion the za starts off amazing and fun but after becoming a habitual smoker it turns into a crux thats hard to shake. Its not that its super addicting its just nothing is as fun as being high so you want to be high all the time. It dulls feelings but highlights feelings of existentialism which can sometimes be over bearing. I would also feel stuck in my life a lot, like it would be hard to make changes but i would want better things for myself but it always seemed impossible to achieve. I did have problems with breathing but I have a history of asthma and took up tai chi to compensate which I found really enjoyable and it helped me to slow down greatly on smoking. The one most annoying thing with being a smoker is your tolerance level goes way up so even though you are smoking you arent getting that high you used to get, just a mind numbing insomnia almost. I also had a loss of appetite over time and ate less. It also made me feel comfortable with where I was in life and I had a lack of motivation, tho somedays like once a month or two it could really motivate you to do something but that would wither away quickly. Overall I would recommend it only at parties or every once in awhile but I have quit a while ago and never want to go back to being a daily smoker. Also me being an expectant mother now has changed my feelings towards it. I dont want my kids growing up around it or around me being high.I feel they should find that on their own if they want and I shouldn't influence them to think its ok."
  girl breaks down in tears at a restaurant when she discovers her cheating boyfriend is leaving her before their wedding.,"Waiters, what is the saddest thing you have ever seen?

Waiters, what is the saddest thing you have ever seen? A couple walks in, she is super happy, and very visibly in love, him, not so much. Everything is going alright, they finish their main, I approach them to clear the plates and ask about dessert, the girl is not so happy anymore, and the guy seems tense. I asked if they'd like to see our desert menu, and the girl started crying. I excused myself and started to dig into what happened with my coworkers. Someone says they heard the guy is going on a long work trip, so I figure the girl is just sad because her boyfriend is probably being deployed or something. I decided to try brightening up their evening by bringing them some free desserts, and my boss encourages me to get them something to drink and takes out the appetizers from their tab, so I think I'll just take some cheesecake and asks them if they'd like a glass of wine on the house, and asked if they'd prefer white, red, or something non alcoholic. The girl just absolutely loses it. She is now ugly crying, with snot and tears dripping down from her chin while she repeatedly asks the guy how could he do this to her. I'm standing there holding the cheesecake feeling like the dumbest creature to wander the land. I walked her into the ladies room, and helped her get a hold of herself. The guy apologized, paid, tipped well, and left. Apparently he was being deployed, he had also cheated on her, got his side piece pregnant, and was going to marry the pregnant girl instead. She had to tell her family she was being dumped a couple of months before her wedding. She kept repeating how she had already sent the invitations. It was heartbreaking."
"  seeking revenge, the black sheep of the family exposed his cousin's infidelity, resulting in family estrangement and unexpected connections.","I Ruined a marriage and my family for revenge

I Ruined a marriage and my family for revenge. I’ve always been the black sheep of the family. Cousins grew up to be doctors, professors, creatives and whatever else. Meanwhile I’ve managed to just make a humble stable passive income through some business decisions, nothing fancy but I can afford a one bedroom in New York and live comfortably with that and a part time job in a cafe. Everyone in the family including my own parents judge me harshly for not pushing myself to do what my cousins do, especially my one cousin we will call Randy. Think the stereotypical dude bro who got rich thanks to working for his dad, multiply that by ten, and you got Randy. He always gave me the most shit, and eventually I just tuned them out cause I get to enjoy my life with my partner, work part time and still afford what I want. Randy has a wife and two kids, he also had a mistress. I found this out cause one day when I was walking through the city when I saw him walking down the street with a woman who clearly wasn’t his wife, arms around each other. I checked Facebook and saw he had indeed posted about visiting a bagel shop in the city while on a business trip that morning so we head indeed headed into the city. So, I decided, let me see how this plays out. I followed them for five hours, snapped several photos, one of them going into a hotel together. I held onto these and waited until Christmas that year, about 6 months later. I decided to unceremoniously drop printed photos in front of everyone at the table before dinner and made sure to get his wife to see them. Queue screaming and fighting, I actually got a black eye out of it. It was Randy’s dad who did it though not him. Queue police, a lot of questioning, my partner and I get kicked out, we head back home after talking to the cops one last time. The aftermath: Besides Randy’s wife and another cousin who hates Randy, my family cut me off entirely for several years. Whatever, even my parents had always expressed disappointment in me for not applying myself fully so no real loss there. Randy got divorced and lost full custody of the kids after threatening his ex. My family occasionally tries to guilt me into apologizing but my response is “not gonna apologize for outing a cheater” and I’m promptly blocked for another few months. My partner and Randy’s ex wife are good friends and the kids call me uncle, nice having a family who actually loves me unconditionally for once so and I got married and that’s when my family last tried to get into contact with me and were actually nice for once, seeing me moving on I guess eats at them.

"  doctor's indifference prolonged agony, but a life-saving surgery for a severe bowel obstruction finally brought relief after years of pain.","What is the most hurtful thing a medical professional has ever said to you?

What is the most hurtful thing a medical professional has ever said to you? My doctor didn't actually speak, his reaction was worth a thousand words though: he literally rolled his eyes, threw his head back and sighed very loudly. I had been having a semi regular pain in my abdomen for years, a terrible cramping pain that would double me over in pain and would last for a day or two and then go away. I had seen a few different doctors about it and none of them could figure it out. I was seeing a gastroenterologist about another problem and mentioned my pain to him. He did some tests, tried a few things, did an endoscopy and told me he couldn't find anything wrong. The next time I got the cramping pains I went back to him and he performed his non-verbal routine mentioned above. It would have been less hurtful if he'd just told me I was a hypochondriac. I gave up on figuring out the pain. Fast forward a few years and I'm having a bout of these cramps. Middle of the night I get up to go to the bathroom. I puke my guts out and proceed to pass out on the bathroom floor for a few seconds. I make it back to bed without waking my wife and somehow fall back asleep. In the morning I get up and need to puke again. My wife goes with me out of concern and I pass out on the toilet. She calls 911 and I get whisked away to the hospital. Didn't take too long for the doctors to determine I had a bowel obstruction. After 6 hours of surgery and a subsequent week stay in the hospital I'm back home and feeling better than I have in years. Turns out that I had a 99% bowel obstruction caused by adhesions that had been slowly developing on my intestines since an appendectomy that I had in 1980. The surgeon told me that it was so bad in a few places that my intestines had been twisted on themselves. He referred to it as a rats nest. The surgery was in March, 2017, and not only have the cramps not come back once, I haven't felt this great in decades!"
"  caught between his wife and devoted mother, a man contemplates divorce after being asked to choose between them.","My wife asked me to choose between my mom and her and I think I am going to divorce her.

My wife asked me to choose between my mom and her and I think I am going to divorce her. My mum and dad were both orphans, my dad died two weeks before I was born, my mum didn't really have a support system, so we were just the two of us. I never lacked anything because my mother worked all her life to give me the life I have today and didn't even have time for herself to start a new life again. She did all the little jobs possible so that we didn't miss anything. She deprived herself of food to give me food, I had very good clothes while she had none. I saw her make sacrifices again and again and always with a smile, frankly I always thought she was an angel dressed in a human body. The only time she yelled at me was when I was 16 when I saw her getting sick and working at the same time.
I wanted to help her by finding a job, but she was angry and told me it was not my job to take care of her and it was up to her to take care of me, she wanted me to get really good grades to get into the best universities it's the only way I can protect myself when she can't anymore. Even at university she didn't want me to work, I had to be focused on my studies, but she wanted me to volunteer so that I could be an adult who could do something with his hands. I met my wife there while both of us volunteered. My wife is a good person, but she was never close to her parents or her siblings. Yet she adored my mother since she met her. There were times when I thought she loved my mother more than she loved me and we laughed about it. Deep down, I think she was looking for the bond between mother and daughter that she did not have from her mother. When I finished my studies, I found a job, we moved in together, but she wasn't comfortable that I call my mom everyday, but eventually she stopped mentioning it. Two years later I bought a house for my mother, because we never had a house in our name, we lived from apartment to apartment, so for all the sacrifices she made it was for me the least of it and it was non negotiable, that's where the problems started with my wife. She wanted me to think about us first, I told her my dream had always been to buy my mom a house since I was little and that's what I had to do. But she complained about It to my mom. My mom didn't even know I bought a house for her as It was supposed to be a surprise for her birthday. She was uncomfortable receiving the house because of my wife and told me that it wasn't necessary that we could use It for us when we get married. I was furious. I told my mother that the house was for her, that she could do with it whatever she wanted but it was time for her to think about herself first. Our relationship survived that, we got married and then we had our own house. Our life was going well until two months ago when my mother fell ill, I wanted her to come and live with us so that I could take care of her, but my wife didn't want to, I then decided to rent an apartment with my own money right next to our house so that I could be close to her and go there to take care of her. But even that idea didn't sit well with my wife. Me and my wife don't have children yet, we both work. I usually come home at 6 P M, but since my mother is sick, I go to see her and come home at 8 P M. On weekends I see her for 1 or 2 hours and the rest of the time I spend It with my wife. We go on dates, I always accompany her in her hobbies even though she never went to mine. Two days ago she told me that she thought about it and she thinks I prioritise my mother too much. She told me that I had to choose between my mother and the life I want to build with her.The truth is that I never made her feel that way. We both work but I'm the one who cooks, and I pay a person to do the housework. I make sure I do the dishes she likes, she didn't even know what I like to eat because I never complain. I run her baths, give her massages, flowers, I write her poems that I hide somewhere in the house for her to find out, we go on a trip one weekend a month, I earn much more money than her, I told her to keep her money for herself and I take care of all the bills, even hers, I always make sure to listen to her and consider her opinion, and I think I am easy going because I can change my mind to accommodate hers, but I realize that she tries to completely change my stance on the only subject where I don't give her a choice, which is my relationship with my mother.

  a doctor recounts the heartbreaking experience of a young boy's sudden death due to a ruptured arteriovenous malformation in the brain.,"Doctor, What was the saddest death you have experienced in the hospital?

Doctor, What was the saddest death you have experienced in the hospital? I was the junior resident on call for neurosurgery at a busy university. I was in the emergency room on a Saturday morning just after rounds, checking in on some non urgent consults. The ER was quiet that morning and I was talking with one of the ER docs. Suddenly, the doors to the waiting room burst open and a man, crying in distress, ran carrying an unconscious, lifeless looking 8 year old boy. The nurses quickly triage the patient into the trauma room, ER docs and the trauma team arrived. Morbid curiosity and dread kept me around. I vividly remember the ER doc calling out ""Pupils 6 millimetres, non reactive"". That's when my dread truly set in. I suspected an intracranial bleed. The father was giving the history to the ER: His son lives with his mother, he gets to spend a week a month with the father. The child had a baseball game that day and they were sitting at breakfast when suddenly the child said his head hurt and then collapsed into his cereal. They lived just down the street so the father grabbed his son and sprinted the 3 blocks to the ER. I remember him saying ""oh god, oh god no"" They stabilized the child and got him to the CT scanner. He had a ruptured arteriovenous malformation in his cerebellum. The haemorrhage was causing compression on the brainstem and blockage of his cerebrospinal fluid resulting in acute hydrocephalus. I called my chief resident and attending surgeon who understood this was absolutely critical. Plan was for an external ventricular drain to reverse the acute hydrocephalus. Then depending on the child's exam and ICP possible OR acutely versus angio suite. At this point the mother arrived. I could tell they had a strained relationship and she was upset at the father, who was in tears. She was agitated right until the point where she saw the child now intubated with IV, arterial lines coming out of every limb. At that point she broke down and they embraced in their sorrow. The patient was taken to the ICU, where I was setting up to place the external ventricular drain which is a drain placed through the skull into the cerebrospinal fluid spaces in the brain to monitor pressure and drain fluid. I was moving quickly because I knew time was of the essence. I was in the procedure drilling a hole in the skull, while the rest of the room was full of nurses drawing medications. At that point it's somewhat like what I expect an NBA player feels like when he is shooting a free throw. I don't notice anything except the task at hand. I looked up to ask the nurse to get the collection bag ready and through a crack in the curtain I saw the mother and father watching me. The look on their face I will never forget. I see it as clearly now as I did then. 1000 yard stare. Faces soaked in tears, but eyes now dry. The horror setting in more and more. I froze and that moment will stay with me forever. In an instant, reality clicked back in and I asked the nurse to close the curtain. External ventricular drain went in. My attending and chief arrived. The circumstances were dire. The pressure on the brainstem was too much to go to angio and decompression had to be done in the OR. After a short discussion about the procedure the parents told my attending to do whatever he could to save the child. We rushed the patient to the operating room. Positioned him on the operating room table. And his heart stopped beating. Between the nurses, surgeons and anesthesiologists, we did CPR for 30 minutes knowing that it was in vain but not knowing how to stop. Perhaps we were imagining our own children.

"  disturbing family secrets discovered after father's death: twins given up for adoption, abusive stepfather, and father's hidden second family.","What disturbing thing did you find out about someone after they died?

What disturbing thing did you find out about someone after they died? My dad had 5 siblings. When he was 4 his mum gave birth to twins and then promptly gave them up for adoption through the church. When he was 6 his Biological dad split and went off to Port Elizabeth. He got a stepdad who physically abused him and forced himself onto his sisters. He ended up with another 6 half siblings. In the 70's my dad asked his mom what happened to his bio dad, and he was told he died. Sometime in the late 60's or early 70's. My dads mother and stepfather died in 1999 and we never thought anything about his bio dad until my mother did some digging on facebook in 2016, trying to find his twin sisters, which no one said existed. My mother eventually tracked them down, two ladies in their late 60's who only found out in the last few years that they were adopted. One didn't take it well and wanted nothing to do with us, the other was a bit more communicative and my dad eventually went to visit them, they still chat every now and then. Whilst this was going on, some interesting DNA matches had come up on my family tree thing from MyHeritage. Turns out, my dads bio dad had another family, had like another 6 kids all with the same names as his old family. My mother got in contact with one of the sons, asked him a few questions about his father, who died in 2007. Mum eventually told this half brother what happened, about how his father had another family in Joburg which he abandoned, and he has 6 half siblings. All communications ceased then. Mom was instantly blocked. One of the wives of my dads half siblings got nosey and started talking to mom, and let her know that the family is in meltdown and in denial over their father, grandfather and patriarch who by all accounts was a good Christian man and pillar of the community, having another family in Joburg, and abandoning his first set of kids."
"  a counsellor pranks campers with a fictional giant loon story, culminating in a terrifying encounter, resulting in early departures and amusement.","Somewhere in this world, there is a 26 year old with a debilitating fear of birds. And I'd do it all again.

In high school, I was a counsellor at a summer camp for elementary school kids. One day, about four days into camp, a kid of about eight walked up to me holding a huge feather, like from a hawk or something. He was all excited and proud, but for some reason, my immediate reaction was to go, 'Oh, no! Where did you find that? That's a feather from the yellow-bellied lake loon, oh, man, does this mean it's back?!' Now, the kid, for this part was immediately sceptical. 'Uh. It's just a feather from a big bird' Well, at that moment, my buddy Derek walked up, oblivious to the situation. The kid shows him the feather, and, for reasons known only to Jeebus, says, Oh, no! Where did you find that?! Like, just absolutely amazing. The kid absolutely freaks, drops the feather and runs off. I fill Derek in on what happened, and we laugh about it, thinking it's over. Later, we're in the dorms, and the kid walks up with a few older kids, demanding we tell them about the loon. We concoct this story of a giant, yellow bellied lake loon that was notorious for stealing campers from the lake shore (and sometimes their bunks). Another counsellor, Daniel, is working behind the dorms and hears our tale. The older kids don't believe it, and question him about it as they go outside. Having heard the Legend of the Loon without their knowledge, he confirms every grizzly detail, thereby sealing it as fact. Before supper, it had spread throughout the camp, all through the boys and girls dorms. Amazingness. Kids would take turns keeping lookout during swim time, and it became an easy way to scare them into submission at bed time. Well, we keep this going until there are three days left in camp. Another counselor, Jeremy, had to be back at his summer job early the next morning, so we hatched a plan. I left and drove to my parents (about an hour away), and retrieved this ginormous stuffed lobster I had won at the fair. Going McGuyver with sheets, the lobster and costume stuff from the camp, we dressed me up like a giant yellow-bellied lake loon. At around 5 the next morning (when Jeremy had to leave camp), I burst into the boys' dorm, cacawing and flapping my ""wings"". I attacked Jeremy in his bed, dragging him out of the dorm, him screaming all the while. There was. pandemonium. Kids were screaming, crying, terrified. Meanwhile, Jeremy got into his car and drove home, never to be seen by the campers again. We got most of them settled down, but not all. About six kids were so freaked, their parents came and scooped them early. We never admitted to the parents that we knew anything about it, and never assured the campers that it was just a prank and that Jeremy was alright."
"  man picks up a hitchhiker, gets knocked out, wakes up robbed. Returns home to find his own funeral underway.","TIFU by picking up a hitchhiker and then showing up to my own funeral

This happened a few years ago and I was living in Zimbabwe at the time, and I was having a pretty bad day, I was going to see my aunt who lived about 400 KM away from me. If you're African you'll understand that this was no small journey. So I got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a Dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction, so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in. We go to talking and he happened to be going to the exact same village as me and he knew my auntie! Half an hour passes and we're making polite chit chat and reminiscing about old times in Zimbabwe, when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over, so I do. He runs out of the car and starts making retching noises, so I assume he's throwing up. It's dark at this point so I can't really see much, so I go check on him. I get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he's not. Then I hear someone behind me and before I know it I'm unconscious! So I wake up a couple hours later without my car, clothes or wallet. So I'm thinking great. I look around and see I'm on some farmland wearing the guys clothes. So I start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement. I explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a day's walk from where I am and they don't get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night. I start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come across a road, so I pitch up and start waiting, after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch I let him know the situation and he says we're in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he's willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which I thought great! its takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and I say my goodbyes to my driver. I take down his number so I can repay him later on. At this point i'm starting to recoginise my surroundings, I walk for a few miles and as i'm getting closer to my aunties i can hear a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i thought was strange. I'm about 100 feet from the house and I see my Son which again I thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time, but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does. He runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment. I get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent. My wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like I've been gone for months. My auntie appears and immediately faints when she sees me. I still have no clue what's going on at this point and i'm exhausted, so we rush to get my auntie inside and I see my picture on top of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room. So it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car, my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldn't identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was my wallet, they assumed it was me that had passed in the crash. Since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral pretty quickly and that is what I had stumbled upon. My son still has nightmares to this day and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitchhiker ever again."
  a girl's risqué performance in a club escalated as she stripped and engaged in explicit acts with eager patrons.,"Clubbers, what is the most desperate thing you have witnessed in a nightclub?

Many years ago a group of us (4 couples, 8 people total) went to a club to see a big name group that was performing there. It was a few hours away, so we were staying at a hotel somewhat near the bar that night. All of us were sitting at the bar during the show.
Sometime during the night a girl jumped up on the bar and started dancing. This club was the type of place where this wasn't discouraged, people just picked up their drinks to clear the 'dance floor' and let her go. She was wearing a short skirt and didn't mind that it slid up her thighs a bit as she danced.
Guys were hooping and hollering at her, and the more they did, the wilder she danced. She thrived on the attention she was getting. The corner of the bar was a few seats down from me, and she danced 10 feet or so down one side, then rounded the corner and came 10 feet or so up our side. Back and forth, back and forth. Then she started doing flirty moves in front of any man that whooped the loudest. I was pretty lit by this time and enjoyed the show, but at the same time was a bit surprised it was happening, and happening right in front of me.
Then the underwear came off.
Our corner of the bar went absolutely nuts. The hooping and hollering turned into clapping and whistling and she loved it. Back and forth she went. By this time we were out of our minds laughing, yelling, whooping and whistling. It was unbelievable. But she wasn't done yet. The girls we were with weren't happy with the show, but 2 of the guys in our group weren't in a committed relationship with their date, so they didn’t care what they thought, they were more interested in the chick dancing on the bar.
Now comes the part that actually shocked me. Obviously guys were trying to touch her as she danced by, and I guess she chose the special ones, because the next thing I knew she was doing a dancing squat on the bar while landing on fingers. Then she'd stand up and dance down the bar. Guys saw what she was allowing and put their hand on the bar with a few fingers in the air."
"  partner hid contact with abusive ex, hung out with ex and his friends, blocked communication, and eventually cheated, causing immense pain.","What is one thing your partner hid from you until later in the relationship?

An ex of mine hid the fact that she still held contact with her abusive ex for the entirety of our relationship. I'd found out earlier that she did this, I tried to let it slide but some of the stuff being said to her made me very uncomfortable. She also would often talk about how she had hung out with her ex and his friends the previous weekend, just before she would be with me. Eventually I asked her to stop talking to him, as it made me feel super uncomfortable in the relationship, and that it felt like she just wanted to move back to being with him. She agreed to not talking to him or his group of dirt stains, which really meant hiding it from me. I found out when she would not respond one night, I got worried as we talked every day. So the next day I asked if she was alright and if anything was wrong, or if she just needed a quiet night. Turns out she had blocked my phone to ""not make him mad that I was talking to you."" Me, being the dunce I am, didn't break it off. She did after I got to her house the night after her ex slept over, and they slept with each other. She said they did it to bond for old times sake. I guess we all have to learn that the first relationship is rarely ever the one you'll have for the rest of your life. I wanted that one to be so bad. It put me in and out of the hospital for a while. "
"  doctor delivers end-of-life news to family, sparking emotional turmoil and hostility. Pastor's preaching eventually leads to acceptance and decision.




","Doctors, what was the worst reaction  that you have ever gotten from telling someone their loved one will die?

Jesus convincing a family to put their father down is wild to see. I was a second year resident in Family Medicine doing an ICU rotation in a pretty big city downtown major hospital. One night we admitted a guy with sickle cell who developed acute chest syndrome and decompensated quickly. That night we worked to stabilise him and he held on. I told the family, if his lungs hold up there's a chance he could do okay. I went home post call and came back to him in multisystem failure, lungs giving out with essentially nothing left to do. The attendings loved to have us Navy Family Med docs do the ""talk"" with families, we must have been good at it. Since I knew the family already they were ecstatic to have me back and said ""you're up!"" I took a second year medicine resident with me to get a feel for the process, and the attending took us to the family room to talk. There were about 20 to 30 family members there, all ages and types. The POA was his daughter who didn't know him too well but was the closest relative as parents and wife had already passed. I started to tell them the news. That thing I had mentioned about the lungs holding out, well unfortunately they aren't anymore, and nothing else is either. The four medicines to keep his heart pumping won't work much longer, we need to talk about what to do. They said, pull the plug? And I said, yes, maybe. The handful of young girls that weren't the POA all started crying, one actually took off running and screaming down the hall. The men in their teens and twenties started swearing under their breath and congregated in the corner, staring daggers at me and I'm sure planning on how to make sure the same thing happened to me as their family member. I'm guessing around then the other resident and attending sunk into the room, kind of like homer through the shrub, because I was by myself for the rest of the event. I tried getting the daughter to make a decision, but she couldn't. So she kicked me over to one of his cousins. The middle aged folk were arguing, each with their own opinion and knowing everyone else was wrong. No one could agree, except that I was wrong and I didn't know what I was talking about and I lied to them the other night. They eventually punted to the next generation. His aunt was there with a few older folks sitting in a corner. She was far more reserved and realized the situation and came to terms with it pretty quickly. She thought it was best not to let him suffer, so tried convincing the daughter to sign the paper. But the daughter couldn't bring herself to do it and started crying. After a few minutes more chatting, crying and arguing another guy I had not seen yet started proselytising. ""I just had a talk with my brother 'Ben' the other day about this exact thing. He knew he was in bad shape, and soon he would get to go back to Jesus"". It was apparently the family's pastor, and he started preaching. With each sentence, another person joined this circle around me, the POA and the preacher until everyone was back. With each mention of 'Ben' and Jesus, there was another Amen! or Hallelujia, until everyone was yelling the joys of God. Finally, the daughter said yes let's do it to a resounding Praise Jesus! We signed the papers after about 15 minutes of all this. I found the other two docs in the corner, the other resident bug-eyed and quiet. In the hall, the Intensive Care attending of over 12 years said ""Well, that's the craziest thing I've ever seen.""

"  gang life: drugs, violence, initiation rituals, fear, uncertainty. Some positive connections, but ultimately quitting due to fear and uncertainty.","Former gang members, what was it like being in a gang?

When I was living in Chicago I ran with some Latin Kings. I wasn't ganging but ended up dating someone who did and hung around with his group of friends. It was crazy.
I watched him sell dope to the people in his own neighbourhood. The cops not only knew them by name and alias, but when we all got caught trespassing at an elementary school at 11 P M, one of the cops asked how one of the Queens had been doing since she had calmed down.
Our nights consisted of walking the neighbourhoods for hours trying to find something to do, like throwing up the crown at passing cars to see if they were a Rival gang or not.
So many of the girls were extremely young, like 15 to 20 and had already had a kid or two by a King that's at least 5 years her senior.
The Kings have a certain date in January where all the local chapters meet up in the park and have a picnic. There's a salute that involves putting your right hand over your heart and reciting something out of a bible all whilst facing the sun.
It was blood in, blood out. To get initiated, the males or females have to be hit for about 30 seconds by 5 to 10 members. They had weekly meetings and if someone didn't attend them it would be considered a violation, and they would have to stand against a wall and let the other members hit them for 15 seconds.
For women, they could be beaten in, or they could sleep with the entire gang. The women who chose the latter would lose all respect for the gang and to humiliate them, the Kings would turn them away.
Getting out of the gang for girls was easy if they became pregnant. Not even the most ruthless of the Kings wanted a pregnant Queen.
In the end I couldn't deal with the fear that my house would get raided and I'd go to jail for possession of dope. I never knew if who I was with was carrying a gun or drugs, which they always were. Not knowing if my boyfriend was going to come home in one piece or not was too much and I called it quits.
I'm still really good friends with one of the Queens. They can be genuinely amazing people that just get caught up in a crazy situation. They took me in and treated me like family when they barely knew me, but that's really all the good I have to share."
"  a former teacher's chilling account: Three students with troubled backgrounds, neglect, and violent tendencies tragically turned into major criminals.","Teachers who have taught future major criminals, what were they like when they were under your tutelage?

I taught three students that together went on to take the life of a classmate and others, and they will likely pass away in prison as a result of them.
Two of them are brothers, Adam and Brian.
It became apparent pretty early on that their house had substance issues, and there was some serious neglect going on. Their parents laid hands on them too, from little things the boys let slip. They rarely had lunches, never had winter coats, and their shoes regularly were being glued or duct taped together. They'd talk about fights at their house, substance use, drunk parents, all sorts of things. We reported everything the entire year they were in my classroom, trying to get some intervention but it never turned in to anything. As students, they were entitled and did things like cutting in lines, or taking someone else's candy, and rowdy, but not entirely stupid. I think the total lack of discipline at home, never having consequences for not doing homework, was a huge contributing factor to how they ended up.
Adam was not the brightest bulb. He was a follower, for sure, and a little bit of a bully. He'd posture to show off, but if you pressed him, he'd back down. Never had problems with him in the classroom, after the first week, just in the halls, or recess, or at the bus stops. Acted tough, but at least when I knew him, it was a fairly unconvincing act.
Brian was always kind, but only when neither of the other two were around. A really quiet kid, a thinker. But he stuck by his brother like glue. I guess they didn't have much else going for them, nobody else to watch their backs, so they were 100% together in pretty much everything. I really hoped Brian'd end up in a better place. He was brighter, kinder, and patient. Liked to read. I had hope, with him. I thought, if any of them have a chance, it's him.
And if it weren't for the third kid they fell in with, Carl, he probably would have.
Carl was a problem kid, had a file thicker than a dictionary. I saw him wound a kid with scissors, for no reason, and then say it was because he wanted to see what happened. We had to remove all the scissors from our classroom because he liked to cut things. He threw a desk, once, no apparent trigger. Just got up, threw it at a girl, and then laughed when she started crying.
He was a nightmare on the bus, on the playground, and so on. He had a recess duty assigned to keep an eye on him, because whether he directly did it or not, kids got hurt when he was around. He talked about ending animals, going hunting, and about doing things like taking people into the woods, getting them really lost, and then leaving them. He liked to pick on kids 4 to 5 years younger. He'd corner them and bully them. Sometimes snatching at their clothing, or pulling their hair. He was awful, and constantly in and out of the principal's office.
Adam worshipped Carl, or followed him around like it, anyway, and Brian, well, he stuck with his brother. It was so sad to see it happening. They all lived in the same area, and knew one another outside of school, and I always got the impression that Brian was afraid of Carl.
I know some of the other teachers in the building were. I'll even admit I was, too. I was on constant guard with him in class. He even in elementary school was fully capable of doing some serious permanent harm, and we all knew it.
Together, while still in high school, they abducted and took the life of a classmate."
"  a disgusting, inconsiderate freshman roommate: Masturbating openly, unsanitary habits, tent escapades, and creating an uncomfortable living environment.","What is your horrible freshman roommate story?

I had this one roommate, Tom. Tom was a disgusting inconsiderate addict, and he would venture to be one of the worst roommates anyone has ever had. Here are just a few examples:
Tom went to town on himself several times a day, just under his sheets, not subtly. Being a triple and the largest room on the floor, we had people in and out of our room regularly. This didn't matter to him. After a while, we got him to agree to a rule that if we caught him going to town he would stop, but once he was past a certain point that just wasn't going to happen.
Tom had a girlfriend on the floor and would interrupt us whenever possible (for example, when we were trying to shower they would ask when it was their turn). She was a spitter, which I know because the spit cup by his bed was never cleaned out.
Tom was a believer in the ""shit test"". Apparently going to the toilet only to find out you didn't have to go is a big waste of time, so you just stand up and try to go a little bit first, then run to the toilet if needed. Once, while attempting this, he shit himself (""a little"", he claimed), right before going out to a party. He asked me if he should shower, but then decided he had no time. Obviously Tom did not wear underwear, and when he returned back from the party he just took off his pants and hopped unclothed into bed. I don't think those sheets were ever washed.
Tom once had to pee during a poker game in our room. Rather than leave, he used a solo cup under the table, and then a second one that he urgently requested as the first was filling up. When he finished, he put the cups on his desk. Later, someone noticed that one of the cups was on its side and empty, over the side of the desk, having apparently spilled over his clothes on the floor.
Tom got sick of not being able to do the deed with his girlfriend whenever he wanted, so he had this great idea to buy a tent from Target so he could have privacy with her while we were in the room. His girlfriend wasn't having it, so he moved his mattress and the tent to a janitor's closet. Apparently a cleaning lady walked in on him sleeping unclothed there and he was forced to move back in.
We had two men's bathrooms on our floor, each with 3 showers. One shower belonged exclusively to Tom and his girlfriend. He kept a lawn chair in there, because ""sitting is the luxurious way to shower"". You can imagine what else went on in there, and why nobody else used it.
At the end of the year, we did a survey. Over half of the people on the floor had seen his manhood at least once."
"  intoxicated friend revealed witnessing his best friend's suicide, leading to ongoing trauma and substance abuse, but eventually seeking therapy and recovery.","What terrifying confession has someone told you while intoxicated?

Freshman year of college, among all the new friends I made that year, there was one guy who was always a goofball. Very laid back, casual, down for whatever. The biggest red flag we got from him was that whenever people were drinking and hanging out, he would always essentially black out. He drank way too much and would kind of spaghetti noodle his way around the party. While also intoxicated, after the party had winded down one night, a few people and I asked him why he always goes so damn hard. Keep in mind he said this when cross faded like Snoop Dogg on a breezy summer evening.
While dropping his head a ton, sloshing around, and slurring everything, he told us about how a few months ago (the summer before college started), his best friend called him. They lived in a small town by the beach, and his friend asked him to come meet him to watch the sunset by the water. He biked over there, sat down, and they talked for a while, everything seemed fine. Then his friend took out a pistol and shot himself in the head, killing himself instantly. Apparently my friend had to call the police while covered in blood, shattered teeth, and the skull fragments of his best friend, just totally in shock. And then a few weeks later he went off to college a few states away, still in shock and unable to sleep or focus on anything. He told us that he resorts to substances to get away from what happened, that friend was the only person in his life who he could trust, they both overcame rough childhoods, and how he was having those thoughts after his friend did what he did.
He didn’t remember telling us that story, and I don’t think any of us wanted to bring it up. His drinking habits didn’t change until he was about to graduate, by which point he started going to therapy, got a job right after graduation, and seems to be doing better in the years since."
"  student's suicide revealed teacher's abuse, drugs, and mistreatment. Arrested, heightened security, counseling provided. Over 200 victims affected. Tragic high school incident.","What was the incident in your high school?

The incident was a student took his own life, a very bright student whom I admired greatly because he was extremely intelligent and very easy going. 
The final note was found later, revealing that the reason was that a particular teacher, who was in charge of not only High School students, but also Middle School students, had been giving substances to students and committing intimate crimes against students for years.
The note gave information of how to find the evidence of this to get the teacher incarcerated as well as, from what I heard, a detailed and graphic description of one of their personal incidents. He had gotten away with it for so long because he had convinced the victims to try the drugs and told them afterwards that if they told anyone he would make it look like the victims were in the wrong with experimenting with drugs. The teacher also had ""favourites"" that he would keep close to him and mistreat repeatedly.
Once this all came out a SWAT team had to escort him to a high security prison to keep him away from the very, very angry families who had been affected by this because mountains of threats came flooding in. It was a huge ordeal for the town.
Outside councillors were brought in and I know I was singled out by one because I had realised the day before that the student in question was planning something and I missed them before school let out for the day, so I assumed I would get to talk to them about it the next day. Once the news came out during a meeting I fled the auditorium and was wrangled by councillors and brought into an office to talk about it. They were catching fleeing students to make sure that they weren't victims, but luckily the councillor that caught me realised I just blamed myself for not catching him before he did what he did.
Once everything started to settle, students who had been affected were given the option to graduate early because of the stress and the school understood the students would have awful memories on campus. The last count I had heard of was close to 200 victims over multiple counties he had taught at. "
"  misdiagnosed with migraines, a young woman discovered she had leptomeningeal carcinomatosis after her sudden death, leaving her family and doctors heartbroken.","Doctors, what is the most heart wrenching diagnosis you've ever had to give?

While I was on neuro consults, a 23 year old girl came in complaining of a headache for 6 months. At first I thought she was exaggerating, possibly looking for painkillers. Then I saw she'd actually been to an outpatient neurologist, who tried every med under the sun for presumed migraines, and had gotten a C T scan and M R I without contrast  and both were unrevealing. The pain became unbearable so the girl came to the hospital and was admitted for further workup.
Right after she is admitted, per our recommendation, she gets an M R I with contrast which shows leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (cancer metastases all over the matter covering her brain). I had gone home for the day by the time the result was read (I was just on consult service), but the attending from the primary medical team sat down with the girl around 7 P M that night and explained she had cancer, and they didn't know where it was coming from yet. He explained the most likely places were either her stomach or her uterus. He asked if she wanted help in telling her family (who had also gone home to rest for the evening after being at bedside all day), but the patient decided to have tests done to find where the primary cancer was first so she would have a better idea of what the plan was moving forward when she told her family.
The next day, I get to the hospital around 9 A M. I pull up my patient list, and she's listed as not being in the hospital anymore. I thought maybe she signed out against medical advice. I opened her chart to find out that around 6:30 that morning, the patient became altered and then quickly unresponsive. Code was called, C P R started, the whole work. Her family shows up at around 7:15AM to see a team of doctors doing chest compressions, the team hadn't even had time to inform them of the code yet, because it all happened so fast. Remember, these people had no idea the girl had cancer or even anything seriously wrong with her other than her headache. They were devastated and initially insisted that everything be done to keep her alive. But after witnessing a few rounds of C P R, they asked for the priest to come and give her her last rites, and she passed away.
I cried so hard I couldn't see patients for most of the day."
"  a compassionate act led to reuniting a homeless teen mom with her family. Years later, they shared a special intimate moment.","What’s the best bedroom experience you’ve ever had?

I was day tripping to Vancouver from Seattle and stopped in for lunch at a little cafe. From my window I saw a young teenage girl out in the cold, squatted down in a closed up businesses doorway, holding a small bundle in her arms. She was panhandling, people were mostly walking by ignoring her. She looked just broken.
I finished up my meal and went outside, went through my wallet and thought I'd give her $5 for some food. I got up to her and she was sobbing, she looked like she was 14. And that bundle in her arms was a baby wrapped up. I felt like I just got punched in the chest. She looked up putting on a game face and asked for any change, I asked her if she'd like some lunch. Right next door was a small quick Trip type grocery store. I got a can of formula for the baby (very young, maybe 3 months old.) and took her back to the cafe though I'd just eaten. She was very thankful, got a burger and just inhaled it. Got her some pie and ice cream. She opened up and we talked. She was 15, got pregnant, parents were angry and she was fighting with them. She ran away. She's been gone almost 1 full year.
I asked her if she'd like to go home and she got silent. I coaxed her, she said her parents wouldn't want her back. I coaxed further, she admitted she stole 5k in cash from her Dad. Turns out 5k doesn't last long at all and the streets are tough on a 15 year old. Very tough. She did want to go back, but she was afraid no one wanted her back after what she did.
We talked more, I wanted her to use my phone to call home but she wouldn't. I told her I'd call and see if her folks wanted to talk to her, she hesitated and gave bad excuses but eventually agreed. She dialed the number and I took the phone, her Mom picked up and I said hello. Awkwardly introduced myself and said her daughter would like to speak to her, silence, and I heard crying. Gave the phone to the girl and she was just quiet listening to her Mom cry, and then said hello. And she cried. They talked, she gave the phone back to me, I talked to her Mom some more.
I drove her down to the bus station and bought her a bus ticket home. Gave her $100 cash for incidentals, and some formula, diapers, wipes, snacks for the road.
Got to the bus, and she just cried saying thank you over and over. I gave her a kiss on the forehead and a hug, kissed her baby, and she got on the bus.
I get a christmas card every year from her. She's 21 now and in college.
Her name is Makayla and her baby is Joe.
A fine young lady she has turned out to be. One night she came over for some drinks, and one thing led to another, and let's just say Joe has a little sister. It was awesome. She really expressed her gratitude for the help all those years ago at that moment. "
"  a friend's sister used a knife to cut a stubborn turd in the toilet, causing a chaotic and hilarious family moment.","What is the most disgusting thing a friend has ever done?

My friends sister laid a huge turd in the toilet. She couldn’t get it to flush. So she just casually strolls into kitchen while me and my buddy are watching Friday night videos, and grabs a pocket knife from the junk drawer. Goes back towards the bathroom, my buddy is hey what the eff you need a knife for? So she says the toilet won’t flush. Their dad hears this jumps up and runs down to bathroom and screams who the shit this turd. Which brings mom into the bathroom she freaks out. No all 5 of us are in the throne room in admiration of her magnificent turd. The dad asks what is the knife for and his sister goes it’s what I use to cut them. Yeah that’s what she said. It was silent until her mom asked how long have you been cutting turds with that knife. I am dying. My friend is in tears, well since we are all here I guess the secret is out so I get massive turds on my period mom. So for about six years mom. She goes to leave and her dad grabs her and says cut the cheese sweet pea and that’s your knife now. That’s it. I can't breathe. I am laughing so hard. She is in tears, her mom is mortified and her dad was trying to be supportive, my buddy and I are being total jackasses.
Her dad pulls us aside and threatened to kick the shit out us if a word of sir turdly of bummertown gets out of the house. We never said a word about it outside of their house but we were brutal to her at home."
"  officer intervenes in violent attack between sister and mother, restraining sister and using pepper spray for control. Sister committed to rehab.","Police officers, have you ever had to arrest a family member?

Two years ago I stopped by my parent's house while on duty to have a cup of coffee with my father. When I got there I heard screaming from the back yard and went out to see what was going on.
I saw that my sister had my mother pinned to the ground and was kicking her violently, multiple times, while screaming and swearing at the top of her lungs. I tackled her to stop the attack and she began to punch and kick me too.
The neighbors had come outside to see what was going on and my sister would not calm down. My mother was badly injured and it took my father and me both to get my sister under control. She was fighting like I've never seen someone fight before. She was biting, clawing, kicking, and tried to remove one my eyes. I had no choice but to disengage and use pepper spray in an attempt to subdue her. It worked and we finally got her under control.
I called for an ambulance to evaluate my mother and my sister was transported to the station by another officer. The story, I found out later, was that my mother had found meth in my sister's car and when she confronted my sister about it my sister lost it and attacked her.
My sister was committed to a drug rehab facility and has been clean, as far as I know, ever since. We have a good relationship now, although we'll never be best friends or anything."
"  couple's disagreement over shared meals leads to breakup when one disposes of cooked leftovers, prompting accusations of obsession. Friends suggest compromise.","I broke up with my girlfriend over leftovers

I live with my girlfriend and recently threw away the leftovers of a meal I cooked because she said she wanted to try some.
For a bit of background when we moved in together we agreed that we would each only cook for ourselves and use our own dishes (my idea). The issue is sometimes she will now ask if she can have a bite of the food I am cooking ""just to try it"" or wants to eat some of the leftovers I cook and then she offers to cook for both of us the next night. She now claims that its a ridiculous rule to have and that I should grow out of the rule by now.
On to the incident, I had made a stir fry and was finishing putting the leftovers in a container when she blatantly told me to just leave it out so she can have some, I of course said no and that I ""dont want her to eat what I cook"" and put it in the container and into the fridge and started to leave the kitchen. I went to the living room to grab my phone before going back to the kitchen to grab a drink when I saw my girlfriend pulling my food out of the fridge and taking the lid off. I went over to the counter and grabbed the container and dumped the food in the trash to prevent her from eating it. She stayed silent the whole time until finally calling me an asshole and storming off.
I dont really think I am the asshole as we agreed to this arrangement before moving in (I knew it might be a problem), but some friends said its time to move on from my weird obsession and just share food already. "
"  violent parents: expelled girlfriend, threatened with a bat, handcuffed to a chair, aimed a gun at his face, police called.","What did your parents do that you later realized was insane?

When I was 17 I was in love with this girl and we were planning on getting married. She lived with my grandparents because her parents were awful. We had done drugs once and smoked like 5 times. Bad decisions I know.
So my father gets the news, crashes through the door, grabs my chick by her hair, drags her to the door, and throws her out. Last time I ever see her as my fiance. He then grabs a bat and threatens to beat me with it. after 15 or so minutes he relaxed and dropped the bat to his side. I took this as a chance to de escalate and tried to take the bat and run outside. He tackled me on my way out the door. I had an opportunity to swing and smash his head all over the entry way. I didn't. To this day I wonder if I made the right decision.
So while my father pins me down my mother goes to their room and grabs a pair of handcuffs. I don't want to know why my parents had handcuffs. They placed me in one of our dinner chairs that had an ornate design on the back and stuck my hands through the holes in the design and handcuffed me. Me and the chair are now one. I hear my father go back up to his room and on the way down I hear my mom say ""I don't want that down there,"" to her credit.
My father came around the corner with a 357 magnum. For those not familiar it's a comically huge handgun. Pointed it right at my face. Told me I don't deserve to live. Yelled and yelled. The yelling was my ticket to freedom! Neighbors called the police."
  AITA for not charging rent to my son on a home he partially owns? Wife claims financial abuse. Conflict over rental income.,"AITA for not charging my son rent on a home he partially owns?

Am i the ayy hole for not charging my son rent on a home he partially owns? My oldest son is not my wife's biological child, and is my child with my late wife. My late wife and I bought a three bedroom house when we got married. When I remarried, my current wife moved into this house with me, but I never put her name on the deed. The house was only in my name. My wife and I ended up having several children and needing to move into a bigger house. When we bought our new home, she wanted me to sell the old one. I said no, that this home was something my late wife and I purchased with the hope of one day passing onto our son. I would make it a rental property instead. That was one of the biggest fights we ever had. She insisted we compromise, but I refused to do so. When my son graduated from college, I put his name on the deed to the house with mine, which was another fight, but I felt he was the appropriate inheritor to his mother's share. I didn't share any of the rental income with him thought, as I was still paying all the taxes and insurance. At this point, the mortgage is paid off. I net over 2k a month from this house, which goes into the household budget. My son just got engaged and wants to move into the house after he marries his fiance. He suggested he pay half rent and eventually buy out my share of the house. I told my son I agreed to his plan of saving up to buy out my share, but instead of paying rent, he should just take over the taxes and insurance. We agreed to this. My wife is livid and says I am a massive asshole for dramatically decreasing our household income without consulting her. She likened my decision to financial abuse. I suggested we downsize to a smaller house now that our oldest two kids are leaving the nest, and we can rent out the larger one and be in the same situation as before (owning two homes and getting rental income from one). She called me a selfish prick and won't speak to me now. Am I the asshole?"
  Father's Day tragedy. Depressed dad took his life amid parents' divorce. Narrator's harrowing experience with drugs and a health scare.,"My dad took his life on Fathers Day

My dad took his life on Fathers Day. My mom was threatening divorce, and my dad was very, very depressed over it.  For about a week I went back and forth from the place my mom was staying and my home, where my dad was.  I tried to make him feel better, and he kept asking me about my mom, asking me to talk to her, do anything I could to change her mind.  I couldn't bring myself to tell him my mom had already made her decision. The night before father's day I was leaving to spend the night with some friends.  Before I left, I told him I'll be back early so I could make breakfast for him for father's day.  He said he'll take a rain check.  I didn't think anything of it. I went to a club that night, and took some ecstasy.  I was at the time also prescribed adderall and was discreetly taking more then recommended.  After a hour of feeling nothing I began to feel lightheaded and hot.  My heart started racing and I could barely think.  I begged my friends to take me to the hospital, that something was happening to me.  They shrugged it off. Finally a boy I met that day who was friends with one of my friends drove me back to his house. The whole ride home I was struggling to regulate my breath and heart rate, fearing for my life. When we got to his house my body began to calm down, leaving me extremely weak and exhausted.  I remember laying on his bed, still terrified of what and still could happen.  His dog came up to me, jumped on the couch and curled up next to me, making it so his head propped on my leg, a melancholy look on his face. At about 6am, all my friends were home, and after they begged forgiveness for not caring for me like they should have, I asked to be driven home.  On the way I randomly started tearing up, thinking I'll have to ask my dad to take me to the hospital, something doesn't feel right. When we got to the house I went to the door to see a note taped on to it.  It basically said: ""Don't go in the house and call the police.  I'm sorry for being such a coward."" My already weakened heart dropped.  In shock, I called the police, eyes completely dry, that my dad had taken his life.  I sat on the porch and cried. There was a lot of crying that day.  My mom wailed when she drove up to the house, crying oh my god oh my god.  I was taken to our neighbors house and put to bed in the guest room.  The rest of the day was spent alone, willing my body to survive.  There were moments where I felt like it was going to shut down.  I was too weak to cry. After a while I realized it was Father's Day."
"  fiancée overreacted to an anatomical diagram, demanded person drop out of medical school, causing concerns about her mental health.","My fiancee freaked out after seeing a diagram of private parts in my anatomy textbook

My fiancee Annie and I have known each since we were children and began dating junior year of High school. After HS we both went to our state school and I asked her to marry me junior year of undergrad. I have always dreamt of being a doctor, as has she. When the application process began, I applied to a good mix of M D and D O schools of varying degrees of selectivity. I had initially planned on continuing my education and my state institution because I did not want to take on too much debt. I did end up getting into my state school's med school, but I was also unexpectedly offered a spot at one of the best med schools in the country in New England. I would have been inclined to reject the offer had I not also qualified for a partial, but still significant scholarship. It would still cost me more out of pocket than my state school would, but not significantly. Annie, despite pleas from myself, our parents, professors, advisors etc. applied to only our state school and to some insanely selective schools, that she had no chance of getting into given her admittedly mediocre grades and research experience. She was rejected from all the schools she applied to, including our state institution. Obviously, this crushed her and I have tried my best to support her during a difficult time and to help her remain optimistic. I am currently enrolled at the aforementioned New England medical school, while Annie has decided to take a year off to strengthen her profile with research experience, physician shadowing etc. and is currently living with me. There were no jobs open related to her undergrad major here or in our home state that would be able to give her sufficient time off for research, so she is currently working part time in the retail industry. I have tried my best to be completely supportive of her as I know that this is a difficult time for her, and I have never,ever said I told you so or anything along those lines. This is what ended up happening on Friday night: I was home, studying for a test on Monday when annie came home from work. She came over to my desk and kissed me. I asked her how her day went and she didn't respond, and suddenly looked very pissed off. After a few moments she said, ""what the eff is wrong with you textbook"" while pointing at an anatomical diagram of female private parts in my textbook. I was speechless. After regaining my composure I managed to let out a surprised ""what do you mean? I'm studying"", to which she said something along the lines of ""You know what the eff I mean, why the eff are you looking at pictures of that?"". This was very strange because she knows I occasionally watch corn and has no problem with it, in fact I know that she enjoys corn from time to time as well. I explained to her that I have to take anatomy in medical school but she wasn't having it. She took my textbook and stormed off to our bedroom and locked the door. I could hear her crying and I kept apologizing. After a few minutes she opened the door and threw her engagement ring at me before slamming it shut again to continue crying. I continued apologizing but she did not respond at all. I spent the rest of the night on the couch. Saturday morning, she wasn't home. I checked my phone and there was a text from her saying that she was staying with a friend and that she was done with us unless I dropped out of medical school and found another job because, and this is an honest to god text from her, ""she doesn't want me ogling at female privates like a creep"". This is completely out of character for her. She has always been level headed and reasonable, and has no history of mental illness or anything like that. I am not a stupid person and I know that this has way more to do than a picture of a private parts in an anatomy textbook but I have no idea what to do right now. She has stopped responding to texts and won't pick up her phone. I spoke to the friend she's staying with who basically called me an ayy hole and said that annie is crying and getting intoxicated, and that neither of them want me coming over to speak with her. Her parents passed when we were young children and she doesn't have any siblings or much other family. I have no idea what to do anymore. I love her more than anything, but there is absolutely no way I am dropping out of medical school for her, and I would rather we break up than I bend to her completely unreasonable demands, but I am very concerned for her mental health right now."
  person plans a surprise birthday celebration for girlfriend but her friends make secret plans without informing person. Girlfriend is upset.,"AITA for not celebrating my girlfriend’s birthday with her?

So I've been dating Cora for a couple years now and she just had her birthday. A week out, I asked her not to make any plans for her birthday, obviously stating that I had made evening plans for us (dinner at this restaurant she's been talking about for ages, dessert and then a drive to go stargazing). I had been hinting around it all week to Cora. I also asked if her friends wanted to celebrate with her. They told me at the time they had ""not figured anything out yet"" so I assumed they weren't doing anything and then made my plans. The day of Cora's birthday comes and she leaves in the afternoon. I thought no big deal, she was probably having some birthday time to herself. She hadn't posted her story or anything so I didn't think anything of it. 6 P M rolled around, I'd messaged and called her and still nothing so I checked her location because she normally replies very quickly (we have each other for safety reasons) and she was at one of her friends houses. So I asked her friend if she'd seen my girlfriend because I had a birthday surprise set up for her. Turns out that her friends did make plans for her birthday and didn’t tell me because they thought I would ""ruin the surprise"" and ""wanted it to be a complete secret."" They had lunch and then made more plans to go out to some bars and celebrate. They then invited me but I declined out of politeness and not wanting to crash their plans since she rarely sees her friends outside of work. I messaged Cora to have a good night with her friends and I'll see her when I get home (I had a cake waiting for her and thought nothing of it and hung with a couple of my friends). Cora came home and was angry. I turned down her friend's invitation and she wanted to see me with all of her friends on her birthday too. I said it wasn't a big deal and that I saw her in the morning and when she got home anyway. I also said that the invite felt like an afterthought when she had all the time during the day to invite me and she didn't. "
"  person's doubts about a guy his girlfriend met were proven right, damaging their trust. Rebuilding trust will take time and effort.","I had bad feelings about a guy my girlfriend met and I was right, but my trust is already destroyed.

Some weeks ago my girlfriend attended a party with two friends of hers and there she met some male friends of her friends. One guy really stood out to her because he kept looking at her, he kept playing with her, and he also carried her on his back for fun. My girlfriend was very excited when she told me about all the new friends she met including that guy, and she didn't hesitate to tell me everything about him, also saying how awesome and hilarious he was. She also gave him her number since they met each other and became friends. I kept my mind at peace at first, I accepted that they are just friends and I appreciated his behavior since my girlfriend is shy and doesn't party, she usually just stands there. Next day my girlfriend told me that the guy had sent her 70 messages (actually 70). Some of them were just random letter spams, and there was a 7 minute voice message of him talking about his two exes and how working out changed his life and body. I immediately knew what was going on. I warned her that he was flirting with her and that she should be careful, and she should also keep him a little away. She started saying that that's not what's happening and that he is just being friendly with her. I tried many times to convince her that I was right but she wouldn't believe me. She also supported him in many ways whenever I said something ""wrong"" about him but I won't go into detail. That resulted in me not being able to trust her any longer and breaking down for half an hour. Some days passed and I somewhat got past the situation. Around that time I told her to hop on a call sometime to talk instead of text but she always said how she was really busy and never had the time to call. I accepted it because she actually is a busy person. Some days later she actually told me that she and her ""friend"" were talking on the phone for half an hour as if nothing had happened. I got furious and sent her a wall of text saying that our relationship is not a joke and demanded to know what was going on. The call itself wasn't the problem, that would be a silly reason to get mad. However, lying about even small things in our everyday lives is a problem. We managed to resolve the problem by having a big conversation. It seemed that the problem was finally fading away. I started slowly regaining trust. Some weeks later I even met the guy, and he wasn't that bad after all. (He really was cool and funny as she said).I thought it had ended there. Truthfully, my trust for her still isn't complete after what happened. It will take a lot of time to regain it. That brings us to today. She just told me that the guy texted her something along the lines of: ""Hey, I don't know how to put this but I have something to tell you. You always make me feel amazing and comfortable around you. You are a very great and awesome person to be with. I have a lot of these feelings for you. However, I feel bad that I'm feeling this way while you have a boyfriend, and I respect him. I have decided to cut off ties with you so I can forget about you, I'm sorry."" She said that I was right all along and that she's sorry. I responded calmly saying that I was indeed right. She replied that if anything like this happens ever again she will trust me when I warn her, and that she really really is sorry. She keeps asking if there is anything else she can do to apologize. I told her that she ruined my mood for a long time, she broke my trust for her, she made me think if I was overthinking and being paranoid, she made me behave in a negative way towards her, all of that because she wouldn't believe me when I said that he's flirting with her. Everything could have been avoided that easily. I said I need some time alone to process this madness. As I'm writing this she's spamming me messages"
"  successful car salesman excels in customer service and product knowledge, but quits after being taken advantage of by dealership.","Redditors who rage quit a job without thinking, what was the last straw?

I sold cars from 2011-2013. I was pretty damn good at my job. Had six different 20+ car months and averaged 17 cars a month. I attributed to the fact that I truly took care of the customer and knew my crap. I never pitched a vehicle that wouldn't suit their wants and needs, always fought for a deal that was fair to them and the dealership, was courteous of their time etc. The thing that really made me stand out was that devoted A LOT of time into product knowledge. No one in my dealership knew the cars like me; specifically, no one knew the features land how to operate it. My customer surveys were almost always perfect, a big factor in that is that I spent as long as it took after they picked up the car to show them how all the tech features in the car worked. I got their phone paired, set up their navigation, door and seat settings. Everything. My dealership took notice of this around the same time as the industry did. At the time, not many salespeople really cared about post delivery customers service. I always knew that's what would bring a customer back to buy another car, or at least give me a referral. My dealership figured that out too. So they started something called the ""Technology Clinic"" that would be held every other Saturday morning at 9:30am. I was volunteered by my Sales Manager, I would not be paid for it, even though my job was to sell cars, that's how I made money. Being the (young) company guy that I was, and being someone who truly believes in giving the highest quality customer service possible, I begrudgingly agreed. Not that my agreement mattered. Here's the thing about the car business. Saturday is the busiest day of the week. I always sold at least one car on saturday's, and would often sell as many as 3, just off of fresh customers. Granted, I worked at a huge dealership. This Clinic would often take up my entire morning, so I was missing out on a crapload of customers. Over time I came to realize that the other sales people were turning and burning their customers; as soon as the deal was done, they wouldn't go over the car's features per the customer's request. Instead they would tell them about this nice little ""Technology Clinic"" we had. So basically, I would spend my entire Saturday, doing other peoples jobs, for customers that were not mine, on deals I didn't get paid on, during a clinic that I wasn't being compensated for. On top of that, this clinic was supposed to be more in-depth knowledge on the features, not basic stuff that should've been done at the time the car was sold. So after 2 months of doing this clinic, having no support from managers to get people to do their f’ing jobs instead of pawning it off on me I walked into the clinic and hit my breaking point. 35 customers were there that day, when the clinic was supposed to only have 7-8 max. I spent my entire day doing other peoples jobs, and giving these customers the basic service they were entitled too. That day, the dealership sold 45 cars, 45 customers I missed out on. Everyone but the one new guy got a sale, and I heard multiple salespeople telling customers about the technology clinic. Meaning 2 weeks from then I'd likely have another 35 or more people in my clinic. I waited until I had helped every single customer. They showed up to the clinic, it wasn't their fault so I didn't take it out on them. When they left, I went to my desk, typed up a letter of resignation and went to the GM's office I went to the GM and told him everything I told you, I was going to give him a chance to make it right because frankly, I made a load of money there until the clinic. He responded with ""we'll talk to the staff and see what we can do"" to which I responded ""no you wont, so here's what I can do"" I put the resignation letter on his desk, shook his hand and walked out."
"  parents realize their child is ""weird"" when they show intense curiosity, obsession with knowledge, lack of play, and social difficulties.","Parents of a ""Weird Kid"", When did you realize your kid was weird?

My kid has been the weird kid since about 2 years old. His favorite bedtime stories were the user manuals to my appliances. At 3 he became obsessed with human biology and would watch open heart surgeries on YouTube. He was also obsessed with vacuums - for four years. He would spend hours in department stores demonstrating to shoppers how to use them. At 5, his ""summer plans"" was to teach himself mechanical engineering and physics....I could go on. When he turned 3 is when I started to suspect he was ""different"". It scared the f out of me. He was my firstborn so I had no idea if he was developing normally or not. His thirst for knowledge became extreme and I didn't understand how to handle him, so at 4 I sent him to a child psychologist. I was terrified my son would have a nervous breakdown, because although he was so young, he NEVER, I mean never once in his life, played. All he did was learn. The psychologist made it clear to me, that he was gifted, but that I had to FORCE him to play. Otherwise he would develop OCD and other disorders. (I'm trying to make this short). He is 8 now, and still different, but he does play. Sometimes. I'm happy he is who he is, but I can see that he has a difficult life ahead of him. He doesn't have many friends. Mainly because he would rather discuss the news, than some new game or toy. I can say this though, I don't think I'll ever meet another human being who is anything like my son, and I love that about him."
"  staying safe by running from weapons, de-escalating conflicts, avoiding starting fights, and defending aggressively when necessary for self-defense.","What is a Surprisingly unknown survival fact that everyone should know?

My family runs self-defence classes.  In terms of ""fights"", bar brawls, people in the street, muggings, 
If they have a weapon, any weapon, run. Seriously, you will die, no matter how good you think you are or how many test-disarms you've done in a dojo. Run like f and be prepared to kill if cornered. We witnessed experienced black-belts hurt themselves with a real knife (after signing disclaimers!) so badly they were hospitalised when they were just sparring. It's just not worth it.
If the fight is just ""brewing"", repeatedly announce that you don't want to fight them (attracts help, shows you're not trying to one-up them, covers arse legally, and doesn't prepare them if you do fight). ""Nah, man, I don't want to fight you. I don't want to fight you. Look, I don't want to fight you. Whatever, man, I don't want to fight. I'm just gonna walk away, alright, I don't wanna fight you.""
If it's not immediately life-threatening and you can avoid it, try not to throw the first punch. Again, legal coverage, but also means you're not the guy who gets into something they didn't want to. The first punch is the trigger for everything to kick off, up until that point you can still defuse everything back to harsh words and idle threats. Once a punch is thrown, someone's getting really hurt and you literally have no idea if the other guy is more experienced or better at it that you. No matter who you are. However, you can *react* to anything that appears to come towards you perfectly legitimately... if he's ""faking out"" a punch, you have no idea of that but can act as if it was real.
If you're surprised, ""attacked"", etc. without warning... no holds barred. Literally, who cares about his eyesight, his future fatherhood prospects, whether his kneecaps will ever work again or if he can breathe. You can't afford to end up on the floor, be incapacitated yourself, stunned, reeling, unconscious, for him to summon aid, or even just to fall to the ground awkwardly.
And that guy could stab you and you wouldn't know until after he walked away, things are really that quick, your brain doesn't notice some subtle movements, your body won't scream out in pain because of the adrenaline, and someone who knows what they're doing will not attract attention to the weapon until it's in you, etc. You can't take that risk. Once it gets physical, don't stop until you're sure he's not able to harm you, and then run away anyway for good measure (legal hint: report to the police at the first opportunity, don't wait).
Once they have shown they have an intention to hurt you, and they've started to act on it - nothing is out of line.
And to quote the legal people in our clubs who were always asked the questions: If you feel your life is genuinely in danger, you can do almost anything to protect it until the point it's no longer in danger. Worry about the legalities later. But if your life is in danger, you would act to protect - going back in for another kick, or using a weapon when he's already down and you could run, or anything else? Yeah, that's not self-defence - you're not *defending* yourself by walking back into a fight you could have easily escaped.
Victims who ""just tried to punch him once, but he punched back, so I shot him"" are also often harder to take seriously for ""self-defence"" than ""he was three times my size, I was on my own, he attacked, I was in a struggle for my life at that point"" - especially if they were heard to try to stop the fight from happening, ran away immediately they could, and called the police as they ran.
You can also act in self-defence of others, but again - you are defending. You're giving them time to run away, wife, child, friend, whoever. If there's a threat, that's what you're giving them, the opportunity to escape the threat.
But there's literally nothing wrong with breaking the guys knee as your first action (cough, kick it so it goes sideways, cough) - in fact, from a self-defence point of view, it's perfectly legitimate. It's a perfect way to prevent pursuit and allow you to escape.
Self-defence is cowardly, at its heart. Everything you can to capitulate, avoid the fight, etc. but if it escalates, the quickest, most effective way to incapacitate them and then run away."

The most common toxic behavior normalized that I can think of will always be controlling/overly obsessive wives and girlfriends. It's not normal when your girlfriend yells at you for hours for just talking to a girl. It's not normal for your wife to not let you go to the bar with your friends. It's not normal for your partner to let you only have male friends. It's not normal when they expect to know where you are 24/7 and freak out when you don't text back in 10 seconds. It's not normal for your girlfriend of two months to make you stop speaking to your girl best friend for two years just because she thinks that your friend is a threat. It's not normal behavior it's overly obsessive, controlling and abusive at best.
There is a huge difference between being protective and being toxic and controlling. And the sad thing is most of the time people in these relationships don't really realize they are in an abusive relationship. Of course, my example goes vice versa for guys too but when a guy is being abusive it usually is noticed more than when a girl is being this way since such behavior for girls is considered ""cute"" and ""normal"" when it's all but those things."
"  a betrayed husband wants a prenatal paternity test, but his pregnant wife refuses, causing emotional turmoil and possible divorce.","My pregnant wife confessed to cheating on me but refuses to get a prenatal paternity test

My pregnant wife confessed to cheating on me but refuses to get a prenatal paternity test. My wife is around two months pregnant. At first, I was overjoyed when I found out, but 10 days ago she admitted to having unprotected intimacy with a colleague at around the time she got pregnant. This has been the longest 10 days of my life. I'm humiliated by the betrayal. I've decided to stay in the marriage if I am the father of the child, but emotionally, there's no way that I can take the stress of it possibly not being mine for 7 more months. The anxiety has been eating me alive day and night for the past week, so I told her today to do a prenatal paternity test so we can know for sure whose child it is by the end of the week. She refused and said that she would be way too stressed if we did that and that the ""stress hormones coursing through her body"" wouldn't be good for the baby. I pointed out how short-sighted this is, since I would do the paternity test eventually anyway and it would just shorten the stress for both of us if we found out who the father is by this weekend. I also said that even if we decided to get divorced right now, we would still be married by the time the child is born so I would be the legal father by default if that is what she wanted. She still refused and said there's no way she's going to do a prenatal paternity test. I was pretty infuriated by this point so I ended the conversation by saying that if she doesn't get the test, I would refuse to stay at the hospital when she is in labor, refuse to sign any paperwork acknowledging me as the father, get a paternity test, and legally challenge my paternity as soon I find out the child isn't mine. If she continues to refuse the paternity test, I am considering divorcing her even if the child is mine. I've lost most of my feelings for her after hearing about the cheating. If the child is mine, I should be eligible for joint 50% custody even though it will be a very young child. My wife and I also make about the same amount of money so I shouldn't even be paying her any alimony or child support either, especially if we get 50 50 custody. So I should be in the clear legally. But there's still no way I can take this for 7 more months. I don't know what I'll do."
  woman is unsure if they are the ayy hole for accepting their boyfriend's proposal at their sister's birthday party.,"AITA For Saying Yes to My Boyfriend's Proposal?

Am I the ayy hole For Saying Yes to My Boyfriend's Proposal? Now, my sister and my boyfriend/fiance do not get along well. I don't really know what happened. I think my sister is just upset because she has issues with commitment, and she dated him at their high school and then cheated on him, and is upset he broke up with her. I met him in college, and didn't know it was him. Now, what happened is, last week it was my sister's birthday. She was always into stupidly lavish things, we both are, so she threw a big birthday party at a venue in the forest. Me and my boyfriend were both invited. We've been dating for a few years and he's never been invited to one of my sister's birthday parties before, so we were both thrilled at this development. At the party, my sister was busy opening all her presents, then eating cake, both of which we were there for. Afterward, my sister started talking to her friends, and the guests started to explore the area. It was stunning. Me and my boyfriend were a little bit away when we found a little clearing. We were still pretty close to the venue, but I think it was pretty private. My boyfriend thought so too. He got down on one knee, and proposed. He didn't have a ring, he had one at home though, but he had woven a ring out of grass while we were walking, so he put that on my finger after I said yes. Apparently it wasn't as private as I thought, because when we got back to the venue after taking a selfie and scheduling a post for a few hours after the party was scheduled to end, I was bombarded by a shower of congratulations. Turns out my sister's friend, ""Lisa"", saw my boyfriend propose, and then came back to the venue and told everyone. I figured that I could show them the ring, and tell the story, and then move on from that and back to my sister. While I was being congratulated, another girl, one of my sister's best friends, came up to me, asked to see the ring, and told me that ""Wow, he even skimped out on a ring. He couldn't plan his own proposal, or get you a nice ring”. I was upset, because I wasn't even planning to tell anyone. If someone noticed the ring, I would tell them, but I wasn't going to announce it to the world, or do it in public where everyone can see us. We left immediately afterwards, and my entire family has been blowing up my phone calling me an attention seeking n word, and that I shouldn't have done that to my sister. I'm worried I might be an ayy hole because it was my sister's birthday. and if I said no maybe she wouldn't have been upset about my boyfriend proposing."
"  parent regrets kicking their son's girlfriend out after an inappropriate joke but contemplates revenge, possibly resorting to violence.




","AITA for kicking my son’s girlfriend out of our house?

Am i the ayy hole for kicking my son’s girlfriend out of our house? My husband and I recently met my son’s girlfriend for the first time. He’s been crazy about her. Apparently they’ve been dating for a year before he decided to have her meet us officially. What he’s told us about her all seems great, she just got her degree, was enjoying her job, and is family-oriented. I’m honestly just glad he’s happy with her. My husband and I don’t think he’s ever been this into someone before, so I feel pretty bad about what I did. Last weekend, he brought her over for dinner. By now we’d been anticipating meeting her with how much our son has been gushing about her. How perfect she is and that she’s ‘the one’, in his words. They ring the doorbell. We open the door. She looks exactly like her pictures, which is a great start. My son is grinning ear to ear which is another great start. We invite them in. She accepts my hug and a firm handshake from my husband, and then she opens her mouth and says “I’m the one your son puts his pee pee in.” To be frank, I was appalled. I expected my husband to laugh as both he and my son are jokesters, but this was just too much for me. Maybe I’m reserved, but of all things she could have shared about my son she told us that. One look at my face and my husband knew how much I disapproved. Maybe I let my expectations get too high, and it’s unfair to have them, but I reiterate, of all things to say to her boyfriend’s parents whom she’d never met, she chose to say that? My son was amused at first but when he noticed my reaction his face dropped. I felt like he’d sold me the full package, everything he’d always been looking for in a girlfriend. I was too disturbed by the visual it put in my head, and it translated into anger. I told her to get out, and I wanted to say more about how gross it made me feel but I fortunately left it at that. My son didn’t want to go, insisting I give her another chance, but I was too fed up and uncomfortable by this point. Even my husband, who has enjoyed his fair share of raunchy jokes, wouldn’t let up. They left and I immediately felt guilty. This was something my son had really looked forward to and I feel like I took that away over a dumb joke. I tried calling to apologize but he hasn’t responded. My husband thinks she’s the one who should apologize. I’m considering giving her another chance, but before I do, I need to get revenge, although I fear I will use violence. "

Today he pulled me aside and said I am not good enough for my girlfriend, and the thought of us together ""disgusts"" him.

My girlfriend's best friend takes every possible chance to bully me in front of my girlfriend. Today he pulled me aside and said I am not good enough for my girlfriend, and the thought of us together ""disgusts"" him. Me and my girlfriend have been dating since before the lockdown started. We started dating a few weeks before the lockdown stuff happened, so over 3 years now. We have been super happy together and got a place together at the start of the year. She has a friend called John, they have been best friends since they were kids. He is very openly gay and is married to his husband who stinks of willy cheese. I met John once before the lockdown. He and his husband joined us on our second date. It was only recently that he was actually around and tried to do stuff with us and his husband. Honestly I never liked John, he has always been someone who demands everyone pays attention to him. If you have an interesting story, he will constantly try to interrupt you and try to tell his own thing that is always much ""cooler"". If he cannot one up you he will immediately try to change the topic, or someone calls him out on his bullshit. He has always been somewhat hostile to me to the point where I never really liked it. The last few months he has pretty much just straight up started bullying me. Criticizing everything from my clothes to my appearance, to even things I like. This was particularly upsetting as everytime he did this, I was wearing my limited edition spongebob crocs with the limited edition Gary the snail charm. Last week it got super bad, when both me and my girlfriend mentioned we are going on vacation to Japan for a month, something we both wanted to do. John was apparently really hurt by it, apparently he and my girlfriend talked about that for years but never did it due to lockdown. I tried to be nice and suggested he and his partner come with us and he told me he wouldn't ever want to go anywhere and be seen with a ""loser like me"". This was shocking as his favourite hobby was collecting Tarzan dolls. Tonight was one of our mutual friends' birthdays and John showed up after being invited by my girlfriend. At one point in the night, he pulled me aside when I went to the bathroom and spent 5 minutes throwing an insane amount of shade at me. Everything from telling me I am disgusting to I am garbage. Then he outright told me to break up with my girlfriend or he would do it for me because our relationship ""disgusts"" him. I have told my girlfriend multiple times like “hey can you tell john to cool it, I don't like this and I don't want to be around him.” John immediately denies everything I say he said. He also only does it when my girlfriend is not present. Tonight I told her word for word what happened and she just said she doesn't believe me at all. She has known him for a quarter of a century and she has never seen anything like that. So I asked if she thought I was lying, and she said I was just embellishing what he was saying and she can tell he is unhappy about our relationship but that doesn't change anything for her. She loves me and that is that. Honestly I feel hurt, I feel she is always taking his side always and it just makes me feel like shit. I don't really know if I can continue this relationship, I feel like such a victim. "
  ex-husband's girlfriend requests the narrator to leave her own home so she can move in with the ex-husband.,"My ex husband’s girlfriend wants me to leave my home so she can move in

My ex husband’s girlfriend wants me to leave my home so she can move in. My ex-husband and I have been divorced for almost 3 years now. While he did not want to get divorced, we separated and have been co-parenting our two pre-teens amicably. He lives within 5 blocks of our old home and while we have 50 50 custody, our kids freely bounce between our places and choose how they want to spend holidays. We've tried hard to create a sense of stability despite the change in our family situation and have standing tune up therapy twice a year to make sure we're all comfortable with the arrangements. His recent partner Maria has been the only one to make it past the 6 month mark and prior to this encounter I would say that she makes him happy and is a pretty reasonable lady! She has a very sweet and precocious son that we all adore and generally I thought things were going well. I invited Maria to bring her son to my place if she would like him to join my kids in private language classes, she accepted and this has been going on for a few weeks now, my kids adore him. Last week she said something to me that was surprising. She asked me when I would be moving my things out so that my ex and her could be able to co-habitat. I was taken aback and confused, asking her to clarify ""my current home, this home?"" And she nonchalantly told me ""You don't need all this space for 3 people. We wouldn't have space at my ex's current condo."" Her son looked so awful and embarrassed at this point, that I was like ""Uh, this conversation would need to include my ex."" My kids and I live in a brownstone that my ex and I purchased together 50 50, but that I have been renovating since before the divorce. My ex lives in a nice condo that's spacious but is still a little bit of a man cave. Later in the evening I got a text message from her son that was pleading for me to forgive his mom, that he's sorry for his mom and to not tell my ex."

I JUST Found out my husband is a SECRET MILLIONAIRE and still CHARGES me $500 rent every month I(26f) met my now husband(25m) 4 years ago online. He was a student at university and I was working full time as a medical tech. He was a very hard working, ambitious, goal-oriented person. These are some qualities that were attractive to me. He's an immigrant and I knew his family’s financial struggles. I was impressed by how far he’s come, I would support him in his goals. Soon after we started dating and 2 years ago we got married. He graduated from college and found a job at a tech company and he would work from home while I’d work 12 hour days on-site. I’d ask about his salary and he would tell me it’s $60k. I didn’t think of it much and continued with life. I only made $20/hr and I have lots of loans that I usually pay. Fast forward one year, he moved to a new city and while I was struggling to find a job in the new city, I stayed back for 3 months. After 3 months, he surprises me with a house that is in his name only. He would never talk to me about his finances, he got a loan for a 400k house on a 60k salary. I still didn’t pay attention and Since our marriage he’s the one taking care of finances and taxes etc. I wanted to purchase a house for my mother and sister. I found the perfect house and my bank requested me for Tax returns for the last 3 years. I requested my husband to send it to me but he would insist that he’d like to talk to the bank or he would handle the situation and would try to convince me that his bank is better than mine but I had already locked down on this deal and I wasn’t going to budge. So finally, after a lot of argument he sent me the tax returns. And, the tax return income for last year was a whopping $1.8M and my contribution was $38K. All this time, he would fight with me for small and little expenses. He bought a 2007 beater Toyota with MY money and he still charges me $500 every month. I don’t understand HOW he got so much money and Why he tried to hide it from me. Since I found out, he told me his bank is empty, he spent it all, sent it back home to his parents etc. I am lost and I have a lot of questions."

 Divorcing my HUSBAND over what my Mother In Law said I (26 black female) husband (27 white male) have been together for 5 years. My husband comes from a family that lives comfortably. Whereas I had to grind for everything I have. When we got married his family made me sign a prenup which is fine. I totally understand sometimes you have to protect yourself.I had made him sign a prenup as well. I would say maybe 6 months after getting married he landed a job in IT. In our area people who work in IT make 130k+ a year. And I was just starting out in my career as a realtor so I was making 84k a year(we keep our financial separate).My husband was laid off whereas I was doing virtual meetings and building up clients when I could start my own business. So when we could start meeting in person again I was selling and fixing houses left and right. So in terms I surpass what my husband makes yearly by a lot. So I told my husband how much I was making and he said “we are rich now”and “I don’t have to work anymore”. I looked at him like he had two heads. I said “there is no we only me…I am rich now and I don’t know about you not working part your still going to work…right?” He said “well I don’t have to and some of the money can go towards my mother since she’s been wanting to redo her house.” I looked at him confused and said “are you asking or telling me? Where is the money you made from being in IT?” He said with a straight face. “ I am telling you and my money is mine, don't worry what I do with it. Plus I knew how much you made. That's why I haven’t been looking for a job and told my mom that she can start demolishing.” I told him that I am not doing a damn thing and if he wants to help his mother he can do it himself and I left the conversation. I found his behavior kind of odd because he never talks to me that way nor has he ever been demanding like that. The next day I got home from my office but I didn’t tell my husband when I got off. I walk into our home. I hear my MIL And my husband talking. My MIL said “I don’t know why I let you marry that n-word with the harder they are selfish.” My husband said that some are selfish but not all. I walked towards my husband and said I wanted a divorce I went upstairs, packed most of my clothes and luckily I bought myself another property that I could stay at that my husband didn’t know about. He called me later saying that what I heard had an explanation to it and I hung up on him. Now I get calls from his side of the family saying that MIL can justify why she said that and I’m being sensitive and asking for a divorce over what his mother said is wrong.So AITA?

"  man confesses to cheating on his neglected wife with her sister, seeking solace in an intimate connection.","I CHEATED on my WIFE with HER SISTER. 

I CHEATED on my WIFE with HER SISTER. I know the title sounds bad, but I need to get this off my chest. Me (35 M) and my wife (34) were childhood sweethearts, we did everything together, and she was the love of my life. I proposed to her when I was 20. I thought it was the right time, so did she. When I was 26 and she was 25, we had our daughter. We were so happy, she was the one thing our life was missing. We were such a happy family. Then a few months after the birth of our first child, she gave birth to our son [editor's note: he meant she got pregnant again a few months later]. Again, we were so happy, now we had our little family of 4. Before anyone asks why we had kids so young, after high school I got my degree in accounting, then I went to work for my dad. My dads company is big, I was able to make a lot of money, and yes when we got married we agreed to sign a premarital agreement. We went on dates very often, and our bedroom life was amazing. I showered her and our kids with gifts and flowers 3 times a week. We had a big house. I was able to hear her dream life. We would alway talk about a lot when we were teens. I thought we were happy, yet she still cheated on me. I found out she had a hookup app. When I confronted her about it, she didn't deny it. She said I was always absent and she didn't have a way to be fulfilled. I wanted to leave, but didnt for my kids even though my pain was too much to even look at her. We went to counseling and we did ok for a while, but one day maybe 2 months later, she said she was hooking up with guys every night. She even had a few guys over at the house, and in our bed, in the house I paid for. My kids were now at this point 8 and 7. We knew divorce would be hard on them since they loved us both so much, I didn't want them to have a tainted image of her. Through my grief and pain I stayed, but I moved her into the guest bedroom. You're probably wondering where her sister (30F) comes in. Well throughout all this, she was my rock, my family wouldn't have understood my pain. My wife's family always favored her, because her sister was the ‘mistake’ baby. I still loved her, but I didn't know she made her sister's life hell. My wife was barely home when she moved into the guest bedroom. Now our kids barely saw their mum. Whenever they spoke to her she was either rude, cold or ignored them. When she came home she would get something to eat, drink and go to her room and stay there. So my sister's wife was there for our kids. She would be at the house a lot. She picked up my kids and did things with them. She was also home when my wife was home, but didnt care. After 2 years of this, my kids started to call her mum. She didn't want them to if they didn't want to, but they wanted to, which made me happy, they had only spoken a handful of times to their mum, by now they were used to it and so was i. Me and my wifes sisters would spend a lot of time together and I loved it, so did she. Now this leads me to the current situation. So I had booked a trip to Fiji for me, my wife, and kids. My wifes sister wanted us to try and fix things. Which I tried to do for the first year, but I stopped trying since she wasn't. So I went to my wife and told her about it. She just yelled at me and told me to f off and that she wasn't coming, and I kid you not, referred to her own kids as, ‘those little shits’. This sounds like she knew about our kids calling their auntie mum. If she did know she would have thrown a fit. She said they weren't her’s anymore and it was a mistake to even have them. This threw me off but I did not persist. So I asked my wifes sister and told her what happened. She said yes and we arrived last week. It's been amazing. Me, my wifes sister and my kids have had a blast. They love her and this makes me so happy knowing they have a mother figure throughout all the drama of the past 3 years. So this leads me to last tonight. My kids met another family with kids, so they spent the night, which left me and my wifes sister alone. We talked about the kids and life in general, with the mood and atmosphere. We could both tell something was going on between us, and I kissed her. She stopped me, asking if i really want to do this, and that this doesn't seem right. I told her I did and I feel like we could both feel it (we didn't share a room, my kids shared a bed and I had one next to them, my wifes sister had the master bedroom). So we ended up sleeping together. Yes i know its bad but nothing had happened like this before, the setting really set us up. So right now I'm lying in bed next to her typing this out, about to text my lawyer. She's still sleeping. I just needed to get this out. I know not many people will read this but it would be good to know if one person does. Thanks."
"  American tourist witnesses a fellow American insulting British laws and safety while in the UK, causing discomfort and embarrassment.","What you should NEVER say to a British person?

Okay, full disclosure: I’m an American, but when I was over there a couple summers ago with a group, one of my fellow Americans (who actually was normally a nice guy) said something that mortified me. Fortunately, if any British people were in earshot, they were too diplomatic to say anything, or maybe, when I accidentally made it worse by politely suggesting he drop it, they realized it was pointless, anyway. Our group had an interesting age division: many of us were millennials, and most of the others were retirement age. Most of us millennials were sightseeing together, and we were joined by another member of the group who was older but not quite retired yet. We were waiting in line for the London Eye, and the majority of us easily passed the security test with a handheld metal detector. The older guy, though, set it off, and when they asked what he had, he pulled out a pocket knife. One of the operators confiscated it, sternly telling him it was illegal for him to possess and that he was lucky the police hadn’t caught him with it. They did let him on the ride, though, because it was pretty obvious he didn’t mean any harm and just hadn’t known. (I didn’t either, for that matter.) As we moved along in line, he started ranting somewhat loudly about the situation. I looked at the people in line around us, wondering if some of them were British or if they were all foreign tourists like us. Although I understood his frustration at unexpectedly losing a possession, I didn’t like the thought that he might be perpetuating American stereotypes, so I said rather hesitantly but clearly, “Maybe you shouldn’t talk like that.” He said, “Oh, don’t start that politically correct crap!” I dropped it, but I was still thinking that insulting a country’s safety-related laws while in said country was probably not a good idea, especially when it had a lower violent crime rate than our own and we were probably safer at that moment than we would be in one of our own big cities."
"  roommate had unreasonable expectations and complained to her mother about innocent actions, leading to a humorous confrontation and resolution.","What did your roommate say that made your jaw drop?

What did your roommate say that made your jaw drop? I had a freshman roommate when I was a sophomore undergrad. Her name was Angel but she was anything but. I don't know what she expected college dorm life to be like but she decided to take offense at everything I did. She took it personally that I needed to sit at my desk and study, with a desk light on. She expected me to study when it was convenient for her. She didn't like that I got up earlier than her for classes, she was still sleeping. She didn't like that our bedspreads and things didn’t match. She didn’t like that I came back to the room between 11 and 1 p.m. after my classes because that was when she and her boyfriend took a nap. She would talk with her mother every day for an hour or so and would spend the entire time telling her mom about all of the things I had been doing to annoy her. Which amounted to me living my life. The thing that I overheard that made my jaw drop was said to her mother during one of those marathon phone calls. She was sitting on her bed staring at my back as I studied my notes for a test I had coming up and I heard her say ‘You’ll never believe what she is doing right now. I want to nap but she is in here STUDYING, with her desk light on! She is turning the pages just to get me.’ I was deliberately turning pages loudly to mess with her. Because that’s what I came to college for, to get a roommate straight out of preschool who thought the whole world should revolve around her, just so I can put into action my insidious plot to mess with her mind through the evil tactic of page flipping. I heard that and laughed out loud. Shortly after that she went to the person who ran the dorm and tried to have me removed from our room. I don't know what she told the woman in charge but I got called down and I was told Angel had been complaining about me but that she thought Angel was off her rocker and that Angel had been told that the person with the problem was the one who had to move out. When Christmas break came she moved out and I was given a new roommate who was lovely. She didn't mind at all that a college student would study in the room and yes, would even turn pages while doing it. I haven’t thought of Angel in years, I hope the poor girl grew up over the years."

I have been dating my boyfriend for about eight months. I have always had a very alternative look, even as a child, that got more expressive as I grew up. Colourful hair, facial piercings, tattoos, and very dark and bold makeup. This is how I feel most comfortable and happy. When we started dating, my boyfriend said he liked my look, even though he himself dresses very basic. He even hyped me up when I showed him new makeup looks or outfits. However a few days ago as I was getting ready for work, he kept making weird faces at me. I asked him what was up and he said nothing but kept shaking his head. This really irritated me because he was obviously bothered but I wasn’t going to entertain his huffy behavior. I finished getting ready and tried to kiss him goodbye like I always do but he just turned away from me. This really hurt my feelings and I can’t even lie, I did cry a little bit on the way to work. I tried to text him during my breaks but he didn’t respond at all. When I finally got home and he still wouldn’t say anything to me, I lost it. I asked him what his problem was and why he’s treating me this way. He motioned to my clothes and simply said “that”. I obviously didn’t know what he meant so I asked what about it and he said something like “I just can’t believe you’d wear that to work” I was confused because this is what I always wear. I told him that and he was like “yeah I know, it’s so unprofessional, you’ll never accomplish anything looking like that” I couldn't believe he said that to me. I was fighting back tears at this point, trying to tell him that my job allows it and that I’m not the only one at work that dresses like this. He just kept repeating himself and said that clearly it’s not that good of a job if they allow me to look like that. I couldn't take it anymore and left to go to my sister's house. He called me and I told him to eff off, that I wasn’t gonna change my look because he didn’t like it. He called me selfish, saying that I’m ruining our future together because I can’t sacrifice one thing so we could have a good life together. Even though my job allows it and it’s a good paying office job. There was no reason for me to sacrifice anything. After that, I hung up on him and ignored him the rest of the night. I explained everything to my sister and she does agree my look is unprofessional, but if it doesn’t cause issues at work then it shouldn’t matter. The next day, I had about a million messages from him saying how selfish I’m being and ruining our futures. I started feeling really guilty for leaving. I feel like I’m not wrong here but even my sister kind of agreed with him so I don’t know."

Me being a stay at home worker meant that I’ve always been around for our kids, an 11 year old girl and twin 6 year old boys. If my wife was my universe my kids are the stars in it. So I decided to go and get my stuff in order and she understood since her being the only breadwinner wasn’t an issue (until it was) and we went our separate ways. I went and upped my craft and have been getting more and more job opportunities so I’m now financially better off. I’m still not making lawyer money but I’m definitely good enough to handle things now. It’s been a few years and in that time I’ve come full circle with a lot of things. Like the passing of my father and my own personality flaws. And amidst all the discovery I discovered something that I think I’ve always known: I still love her. Big surprise but bear with me, I can’t shake this feeling in my heart that she’s still the one for me. So I first felt this a year ago when I saw her at a family get together (she brings my kids and obviously stays to chat with my family since they obviously enjoy her company) and I couldn’t take my eyes off her. She was gorgeous. No biggie, I’m probably just alone and stupid. Thought nothing of it. A few weeks later I was dropping off our kids at her house after they had spent the weekend with me. She was in the same damn pajama bottoms she’s had since college and her hair was in a top bun. And she was still gorgeous. Now I’m worried. So I talk to my therapist about it and over the next few months I focus on other things. I get in better shape, change my hairstyle and for the first time I’m even growing facial hair. I’m working on me so that I can eventually tell myself that maybe I was just lonely and going through things. Well 6 months later here I am to tell you that: I still love her. Now I don’t know how she feels but I’m sure of it in my heart of hearts now that I love her with every fibre of my being and truthfully I don’t think I’ve ever stopped. So what’s stopping me now? I don’t want to overstep. Maybe she’s not feeling that way anymore, maybe she’s moved on, who knows? I also have to be mindful of my kids. Last thing I want to do is get their hopes up with something that might never happen. I’d give it all up to have her back in my life."
"  divorced man regrets, still loves ex-wife, awaits her return, unsure of her feelings. Controlling mother caused marriage issues.","I still have feelings for my ex-wife

I used to be married to an amazing woman. We divorced 2 years ago, and we were dating for 1 year, married for 3. She was and still is the love of my life and our divorce is my biggest regret. My mother was a nightmare mother in law. I stupidly let her involve herself in our marriage, and mistreat my ex wife by constantly criticising her. I never called her to complain about my ex or sided with her against my ex wife, but I should have enforced strict boundaries with her as soon as I realized she was going to be a problem for us. I did go no contact with her twice, during my ex wife's miscarriages because I didn't want her to have added stress. However, during our 2nd miscarriage, my mother found out by reading some texts off my sister's phone and went ballistic. She turned up to our home, and instead of turning her away instantly, I took her into the living room and tried to explain things to her while my ex wife who was upstairs resting was unaware of her being there. My mother pretended to calm down, but when I went into our backyard to bring the cats inside, she went upstairs and woke my ex wife up. She screamed at her for 'ruining' my relationship with her and made some horrible comments about her being 'barren'. By the time I got upstairs my ex wife was in tears. I kicked my mother out immediately but that was my ex wife's final straw and we split up a month later and agreed to remain friends. We acknowledged that we still had feelings for eachother, but that this relationship wasn't beneficial to her anymore. We lived in the U S, but my ex wife's dad lives in the UK so after our divorce, she went to go spend some time with him and ended up getting employed by one of his friends. I was devastated by the divorce, & I immediately went no contact with my mother and put myself into therapy. Therapy helped me understand that my relationship with my mother wasn't healthy, and I learned some good strategies to keep communication with her healthy so I'm now in low contact with her. We only speak during family events. My siblings have told me that she still doesn't see what she's done wrong so I definitely won't be advancing beyond low contact for the foreseeable future. I've not moved on from my divorce, and I think I'm even more in love with my ex than I have been before. I've not seen anyone new, and she's constantly on my mind. During the first 6 months of my ex-wife living in the UK, we didn't speak. However, on our wedding anniversary she sent me a text that read 'Happy un-anniversary' followed by 'I thought we agreed to stay friends, loser'. For the rest of her 1st year away, we texted each other every now and then, like on my birthday, her birthday & my brother's birthday. For my brother's birthday, she sent him to my house and I gave it to him for her. Before the MRA's got here, my brother is gay and they have been friends since they were children. He set us up on our first date so I don't want any crazy DMs. During her 2nd year away, we fell into a more typical friendship, and I told her about the therapy I had after she asked me if I had 'cut the umbilical cord yet '. She told me about two men that she had dated and about how both relationships ended. I wasn't weird about it, but it made me think about how much I missed her and how much I still loved her. My thoughts kept me up that night, and I couldn't stop hating myself for ruining things with her. I still have both of our wedding rings and her engagement ring. Due to recently world events, she hasn't been able to come visit anyone here in the US, but she's moving back in October. I was actually the first person she told about that. Everyone's pretty excited, and my brother is organizing a home-coming party for her and I've been invited. It's probably going to be hosted at my house (our marital home) because I'm the only person in our circle who lives alone. However, my brother asked me if I'd hang out with her by myself at some point. I wasn't planning on asking her to, but now that he's brought it up it's all I can think of. They are best friends, so some part of me is thinking she might have put him up to it just like she did when she asked him to set us up together in the first place. I asked my sister for her input, but she said that I shouldn't ask her to meet up with me and I should wait for her to ask if wants to. I think she might still have feelings for me because when she was telling me about one of her breakups she said 'none of the men over here can handle me like you can' but her humour is generally flirtatious so I can't be sure."
  person seeking advice for a dog with alcohol dependence due to forced consumption. Vet suggests gradual weaning process for treatment.,"I need advice from anyone that's treated a dog that has developed a substance abuse disorder, specifically alcohol

I was visiting some distant relatives and went around to their neighbours place. These guys are both dirtbags and animal hoarders. One of their dogs ticks was that it could drink a half bottle of wine. They wouldn't feed him until he completed this 'trick', which he must do twice a day, and is repeated everyday. They think it's a great laugh. I think it's cruel. They are getting sick of him though because now he no longer staggers around after consuming the alcohol and said that they are thinking about getting rid of him (which means a bullet in these parts). I offered to take him, and they accepted. Problem is, the dog seems to go absolutely berserk, and then looks in pain, before staggering around in fright if I don't give him a small glass of wine. Before I realised this, I opened a bottle of wine myself and took a swig, and he leapt up on me desperately licking my lips and sticking his tongue in my mouth. I didn't know if it was a physiological or psychological dependence. I've taken him to my vet, who has said this is a rather unusual situation and alcoholism treatment hasn't been studied widely in dogs, but this dog is likely physically dependent on alcohol and he's going through the ""DT's"" just like human alcoholics do when they are cut off from alcohol cold turkey. My vet said he couldn't professionally recommend I keep giving the dog alcohol, nor could he think of a specialist that could help. Off the record he suggested that I wean the dog down, 50 mill a week until his consumption is at 100 mill a day, then down by 10 mill a day, until 10mls. At 10 mill to reduce it 1 mill a day every 2 to 3 days. He also 'off the record' suggested to be flexible, to put up with 'whining' for more, but if he shows withdrawal symptoms to give a little more if it helps, but to be careful not to teach the dog the 'trick' of acting in withdrawal just to get more wine. I really want to help this guy, as he is amazingly sweet. I find it sickening that whenever my hands go above roughly my shoulder height he covers and he freaks out at the sight of a rolled up newspaper, poor boy."
"  mother-in-law's hostility at a wedding ends with red wine incident, creating a memorable showdown and disapproval from others.","The saga of the dastardly red wine and the unhinged mother in law

A good friend of mine from university was getting married and confessed to me that she thinks her mother in law secretly hates her. She is vegetarian, husband is not. She was invited and went to Christmas dinner and figured she would just eat sides, as well she brought a vegetarian casserole. Mother in law, after knowing her for three years, and being told by husband a few weeks before not to forget friend doesn't eat meat, proceeded to put meat in every dish. Friend drank water and ate her casserole the whole night while the mother in law cried to everyone that friend was so rude for not eating her cooking. A few friends and I were asked to be at the wedding. Friend has a huge family and so this was not going to be a small affair. Neither of them is particularly religious, but a friend said it would be nice to be married under a hoopa as she is Jewish. Husband said he could care less, and told her to go and rent one for the wedding. I was at the bridal shower when mother in law found out the ""pretty canopy"" was actually a hoopa. She almost lost it in front of a bunch of people, but managed to compose herself and laugh angrily that ""if jewish people were being represented so would the catholics."" In my head I heard a record screech that they aren't catholic. So after much fighting, a lot of screaming, crying, threatening to pull money (which is funny because she contributed nothing), mother in law lost. The boot was firmly placed, and nothing was moving it. Hoopa yes, catholic priest no. We all show up, get our hair and makeup done. Slip into our bridesmaid dresses and hang out waiting for the bride to be finished with her hair. She makes a comment saying she hadn't seen mother in law all day and that she skipped her hair and makeup appointment. We all side eyed each other, took a few sips of wine and hoped the eerie feeling would go away. 30 minutes later as we are helping the bride into her dress; guess who shows up.Of course the step mother in law. Flushed from coming up the stairs, in full hair and makeup and a white dress. Not ivory, not cream, full snow white. The dress was clearly a wedding dress, it was even from David's Bridal. Floor length satin with a sweet heart beaded top, a bit of a train and off white lace on the bottom. The dress was even tailored to her, this has been a long con she has orchestrated. The bride burst into tears and aunts and friends ushered mother in law out. We did our best to console the bride, touched up her makeup, and I made her a promise that the dress would never be seen in a photo. She looked me dead in the eye and nodded. The game was on. The venue only supplied white wine and champagne for the wedding party. But I grabbed my purse and ran down into the reception area and managed to flag an attendant by the bar and bribe him with a cool 20$ to give me a bottle of red early. I cracked the baby open, filled a solo cup to the brim with it and stalked outside. After a few swigs from the bottle for courage, I went over to where everyone was getting ready to take photos. With one last hard stare at my friend, I got her nod of approval. I pulled out my phone, held it in front of my face like I was reading a text and walked straight into mother in law. I poured the entire cup of red wine down the front of her dress, jumped back and gasped. The look on her face was memorable to say the least. She screamed, yelled, threatened, and promised she would sue me. People had to hold her back because she wanted to fight me. Eventually she switched from screaming to sobbing and sank to the ground and threw a tantrum on the floor. Everyone moved back and just let her go at it and walked away to go take photos. It was surreal, as if everyone just hit their limit and noped out from around her. The 12 year old flower girl whipped out her phone and snapped a few photos much to our amusement. Mother in law went home and changed into a nice dark green, too small and low cut dress. Because of this she missed all of the photos. Wedding was beautiful. I got death glares from everyone she told that I attacked her with wine."
"  person's wife's company replaces positions with AI, reducing workforce. Concerned about impact on younger generation and job opportunities.","My wife's company has started replacing positions with six-figure salaries with A.I.

My wife is the head of the publishing department for a major corporation. She's in charge of around 200 people, located throughout the world, who spend their days creating and reviewing both internal and external communications for the company. I've seen her on Zoom calls with dozens of people, from multiple countries, spending 30 minutes debating on how to compose a single sentence for a presentation. My wife started as a writer about 25 years ago. Back then, she made 65K annually, which was very good for someone fresh out of college. Now, she makes over 300K, and the new hires for her department make over 100K right out of college. About 50% of the people in her department end up getting promoted or stay with her department, getting annual raises of 10 to 15%. The other 50% end up being poached by other companies, who offer them more money. The only ones who don't end up living an affluent lifestyle are the ones who burn out from the stress. But, starting in January, her department quit hiring humans for their open positions. They've started using A I for the writing, and using humans just to check over the writing, which doesn't take that many people. The goal is for her department of 200 people to be fewer than 25 people by the year 2030. Her job is safe, since she is the manager and has the most experience. Even if they let her go, her severance package would be enough that she could just not work again, and we'd still be fine. But it sucks for the younger generation. The kinds of jobs that she used to get her foot in the door of the upper middle class are being replaced by A I. The pathways out of poverty are getting smaller by the day, and it's not just the working class who are being replaced now. I feel like I just walked through a door that was shutting, and now I'm looking back at the people who didn't make it through that door. They're struggling, but I can't open that door for them. I can just be thankful that I'm on this side of it."
"  an ex-boyfriend that lied for 4 years, cheated with a man. Disowned by family, lost friends, job, and apartment. Facing legal and mental health consequences.




","Use me? Cheat on me? Enjoy losing your friends and family and have fun being ignored at work. Bonus points for possibly become homeless

I just found out 2 days ago that my boyfriend of 4 years is gay. Our relationship was a lie. He used me to cover his intercourseuality because he wasn't ready to expose himself (he told me that himself). He pretended to love me for 4 years. He acted like the perfect boyfriend for 4 years. We were discussing marriage and kids. He even took me to looking at engagement rings..... All while he was having an affair with a man. To top all that, his boy toy called me 2 hours after i walked in on them. Why? To tell me that he was bi and we could all just be together... Are you kidding me? Idk he was making fun of me or if he was really stupid enough to think that was a good idea. But yeah. If you're gay but act straight i f'ing hate you. What's worse is that my family believes i should have been nicer to him because ""gay people have it rough enough already"". So because he's gay then i can't be mad? I can't be angry? I need to be nicer? To him? After his boy toy called i texted my now ex if he was seriously making fun of me and he just said that it wouldn't be a bad idea. So i lost it. His mom and i were very close so i texted her a lengthy message explaining what happened and i told her that i can't stay in contact with her at least not for the time being. She was shocked but understanding of why i need to go NC. Well, his parents disowned him. Not for being gay but because of what he did to me. The idiot went on social media to complain that his parents disowned him for being gay but multiple family members commented and exposed him for the shitty human being that he is. Some of his co workers had him on fb and Tik Tok and they saw everything and now no one at work talks to him because of what he did to me. His friends were disgusted when they found out. His friends always liked me and they're also really big on monogamy so they didn't want to be friends after they learned the truth. He needs to move out because we lived together and now he can't afford rent on his own but his budget is very tight so he doesn't have many options. AND! They broke up. My ex had a fit when his mom called him. In retaliation he broke the TV, my laptop, cut some of the clothes i still had at the apartment and smashed the coffee machine. So yeah, his boyfriend didn't like his outburst and he ended things. Edit: Yes, i am sueing him for the damages Update: I want to start by saying i wrote this post in a state of anger and i was too emotional to realize how bad it sounded. I do not hate gay people. I have no problems with the community. I'm sorry if i came off as a homophobic beach. I really am not. I was just emotional so i will like to apologize. I understand the community is going thru a lot and i didn't want to come out as insensitive. So I'm sorry. Now the actual update. I received some comments and PMs from people that advised me to get a restraining order and make sure he can't find me , i unfortunately didn't consider them enough and as some predicated he followed me from my bff's place to the grocery store and he trashed my car. I'm talking slashed tires, broken widows and what i think it's oil all over my car. Thankfully the parking lot has cameras and the police identified him in no time. He was arrested. I am definitely filling for a restraining order and I'm looking to move to a different city. I will have to see him again in the court room tho. Also, his ex boy toy agreed to testify that he witness my ex breaking my things at the apartment. My ex is also going to be examined by a professional due to his actions it appears he may be suffering from some mental illnesses. I've contacted his parents and they are in shock but they still refuse to have any contact with him.

"  curious about stepfather's odd behavior, son discovers shocking truth: stepfather was a gay adult film star in the 70s.


","What family secret did you learn that totally shocked you?

My mom married my stepfather in the mid 80s. My mom and dad had been divorced since my birth in the early 70s. So, living primarily with my mom, she would of course go out on dates, and eventually I would get the old boyfriend introduction which usually went well. With my soon to be step father, I always knew there was something a little off. Couldn't ever really pin down what it was, but he was just off, if ever so slightly. But hey, my mom really liked this guy, so I was in. Made my way through some awkward teenage years with him, and off to college. Still, I felt like I was missing something with him.
Then, in 1997, my mom and step dad divorce. Towards the end, he would grow very impatient and I guess they would fight a lot, but I wasn't around to see it as I had long since moved out and had my own life to lead in a different state. Didn't ever hear him come up much in conversation after that.
Now, fast forward to 2007. My mom, unfortunately, had cancer and it was nearing the end of her life. I spent the last two weeks with her at her house, just talking and letting her know how much I loved her and what a great mom she had been. For those that have never seen a loved one pass away from cancer, it's not very pleasant. They tend to get a little loopy, forgetful and generally speaking, aren't 100% with it. So, sitting on the couch next to her on one of these days, she exclaims, ""Well, I suppose I can tell you about your stepfather now"". My eyes perked right up, I knew it, I knew it, something was off about him. Maybe he went wild from the Army? Maybe he had a kid I didn't know about? She continued on, ""Your stepfather was gay and was an adult film star in the 70’s"". This, I had not expected.

"  Elon Musk's first wife, Justine Musk, shares insights on becoming a billionaire, emphasizing unique contributions and perseverance amid challenges.




","Elon Musk’s first wife explains what it takes to become a billionaire. 

""Justine Musk, first wife of billionaire Elon Musk, knows a thing or two about wealth and hard work — her ex-husband is a founder of PayPal, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and has an estimated net worth of $20 billion.
She recently posted a response to a Quora thread asking the question “Will I become a billionaire if I am determined to be one and put in all the necessary work required?”
Her answer is “no,” though she says that the Quora reader is asking the wrong question altogether.
“You’re determined. So what? You haven’t been racing naked through shark-infested waters yet,” she writes. “Will you be just as determined when you wash up on some deserted island, disoriented and bloody and ragged and beaten and staring into the horizon with no sign of rescue?”
She then offers some advice:
“Shift your focus away from what you want (a billion dollars) and get deeply, intensely curious about what the world wants and needs. Ask yourself what you have the potential to offer that is so unique and compelling and helpful that no computer could replace you, no one could outsource you, no one could steal your product and make it better and then club you into oblivion (not literally). Then develop that potential. Choose one thing and become a master of it. Choose a second thing and become a master of that. When you become a master of two worlds (say, engineering and business), you can bring them together in a way that will a) introduce hot ideas to each other, so they can have idea s x and make idea babies that no one has seen before and b) create a competitive advantage because you can move between worlds, speak both languages, connect the tribes, mash the elements to spark fresh creative insight until you wake up with the epiphany that changes your life.
The world doesn’t throw a billion dollars at a person because the person wants it or works so hard they feel they deserve it. (The world does not care what you want or deserve.) The world gives you money in exchange for something it perceives to be of equal or greater value: something that transforms an aspect of the culture, reworks a familiar story or introduces a new one, alters the way people think about the category and make use of it in daily life. There is no roadmap, no blueprint for this; a lot of people will give you a lot of advice, and most of it will be bad, and a lot of it will be good and sound but you’ll have to figure out how it doesn’t apply to you because you’re coming from an unexpected angle. And you’ll be doing it alone, until you develop the charisma and credibility to attract the talent you need to come with you. Have courage. (You will need it.)

I did this once back in high school. Motivation: petty revenge and bullying.
There was an annoying kid in my computer science classes, the type who thought he knew it all but was pretty clueless.
One day he was complaining that a game he had downloaded required more memory than his home computer had. I told him I'd give him. a copy of a utility that would do on-the-fly memory compression in DOS. (At the time, a utility called Stackerfor disk compression was popular, so memory compression was plausible.)
Of course, my ""utility"" was a trojan. But I was subtle about it. It was a wrapper that planted the real trojan payload in the startup file (autoexec.bat). The real trojan checked the system date, and only detonated if it was a month later than I originally did this. So he wouldn't be tracing the time bomb back to me. The payload was to trash the partition table, rendering all the drives inaccessible and unbootable. I don't know if he actually ran it or if the payload ever went off; the bomb date was in the summer after school ended.
But the fun part is the postscript. Years later, my brother was playing with and learning programming, so I gave him a copy of my folder with all my old programs to play with. A few days later he tells me that his computer won't boot. Yikes.
I put together a startup floppy disk with a Norton repair utility to start digging, and eventually notice that the partition table had some corruption that looked oddly familiar. You guessed it, my own brother had run my old nasty trojan and got his partition table nuked!"

","Police officers of Reddit, who’s the smartest criminal you’ve ever encountered?

Obligatory ""not a cop, but...""
20 years ago now a guy on Australia's Gold Coast got away with a bank robbery in broad daylight.
He cased the bank for a while and discovered a pattern of the bank manager arriving about 30 minutes before anyone else each morning where he would leave the front doors unlocked so staff could help themselves in without a key or needing to wait for the boss to come and let them in.
One morning the crook dressed himself up for a busy day of office work and waited for the bank manager to arrive. As the manager was unlocking the doors he made his move, entering the building and threatening the manager with a gun. He got all the details he'd need to access the vault and so forth and then tied the manager up and stuffed him in his office.
When the staff arrived he told them that the manager had called in sick and that regional office had sent him in to do the open shop thing and no one batted an eyelid. This bank had a small walk in vault that normally only held about 30-50k on any given day but old mate had timed his robbery for the morning after business banking day when all the local small businesses would make their end of week deposits and reportedly got a score of close to 250k.
Once the vault was open he pulled his gun out and invited all the staff to enter the vault and locked them in. By this stage the bank was due to be open so when he went to leave there were a number of customers waiting to get inside to do their banking. He told them all that there had been an issue with the computers and that the tech team had estimated it would take about 30 minutes before the issue would be resolved and that they couldn't open until then.
Then he got into his car and drove straight to the airport and flew to Hong Kong and then disappeared.
To my knowledge the cops never caught him and never managed to find the money."

The start of that line read something along the lines of ""If anything is going to make me change my mind now it's writing this part"". I realized I had found my dad's goodbye note. I was about 14 or 15 at the time and I had no idea how to go about talking to him about it. I decided to just keep it to myself. He started buying us gifts and stuff and I would get really scared and I still just kept it to myself. I remember one day on the weekend I woke up in my bed to a loud bang coming from my dad's room. I laid there in bed for probably half an hour frozen. Once I worked up the strength I went to his room and opened the door. He wasn't in the bedroom. I was so confused until I saw that the bedroom window was open. What had happened is that there was a gust and the wind had slammed the door shut, but my paranoid brain had heard a shot. After that I was laughing hysterically and I don't have much memory of the day past that. Shortly after this incident my dad had returned most of the gifts he bought us kids and I slowly started to believe that he had changed his mind. I never confronted him about it until last year, about 14 years or so later, but I never fully accepted that he was ok now. I called him distraught about a separate matter and he started talking to me about this topic. He told me on his own about he had considered taking his life, and went into detail about it, and all I could do was cry and tell him ""I know."" We talked a lot longer after that and we were finally able to put it all to rest."

I didn't know at the time that chocolate was toxic for dogs. My mom goes terribly pale and rushes Duncan to the vet, and he has to throw up. I felt terrible about this as I thought it was because he stole the chocolate and was some form of punishment. The next day she brings home more chocolate. Nobody told me that it was for Duncan's own good that he was taken to the vet. So feeling bad for doing this to Duncan, I gave him my chocolate this time thinking he deserved it after taking one for the team last time. Later that night my mom asked me how the chocolate was, this time I decided to tell the full truth and explained that I gave the chocolate to Duncan this time as I felt bad for getting him in trouble the first time. So another late night trip to the vet, and I finally was told that chocolate is toxic for dogs. Duncan was fine in the end, and for the rest of his life I snuck him meat and other things that would not kill him. Now the twist is that the very expensive vets trips cost a lot of money, which prompted my mom to take a look at our expenses. She found that the then step-dad was having an affair, and then got a divorce."
"  unsuspecting girl overhears disrespectful conversation about American girls, shuts down advances with a sharp retort, earning her father's pride.
","What's the best thing you weren't supposed to overhear? 

I was in a cafe in Versailles, where I had been studying for about half a year. I was speaking in English to my father, who was visiting for just 2 days. We were perceived to be typical stupid American tourists. We are American, but not dumb, and we weren't tourists. At least not that day. I overheard a group of teenage boys talking about how dumb and easy American girls were, that we always ""put out"" because we're a bunch of ""dumb cows who can’t get enough attention."" These guys were jerks. not at all the average nice folks I was meeting at school and work. They were going on and on for at least half an hour about trashy American girls and what my body probably looked like in painfully descriptive detail. all very lovely discussion. They were idiots were arguing over who could get my phone number and which one would give it to me better and first. One approached me. In English he said, ""I can't help but notice that such a lovely young American might need a native French tour guide. I'd love to show you around the neighbourhood."" Nice and loud in French I said, ""plenty of us aren't easy or stupid. Go eff yourself."" My dad, who didn't understand the exchange but could tell what had happened at least vaguely, said, ""I've never been more proud of you."""
  gun store employee denied a sale when a customer handed a recently purchased handgun to his young child.,"Gun Store Employees of Reddit, what red flags have caused you to deny a sale?

Gun Store Employees of Reddit, what red flags have caused you to deny a sale? 
Guy asked for a handgun, I asked why, and he told me it was for work, in private security. Showed me his firearm license as well as his security license. Sent off scans of these for background checks, and showed him the products we had. It all seemed pretty normal, his record was found to be clean so when he came back, I gave him the gun. Now see, the thing is, he had his son with him. The kid was maybe 5. And this guy picked up the gun and asked for a box of ammo and started looking for his wallet. I turned around to grab some ammo, looked back, HE HANDED THE GUN TO THE KID! Children that age have no frame of reference for real guns, only for toys. So if you give a child a gun, within a second. The moment they have a gun in their hands, they'll point it straight at someone and pull the trigger. This is what happens every time a young child shoots someone, it always happens within 3 fucking seconds of a child holding the gun that it gets fired into the nearest person. So I turn around, and I see this kid pointing the handgun I just gave his dad not 10 seconds ago, right at my face. Click click click click click click click click. The kid is just pulling that trigger non-stop. Dad fucking laughs, and says he's just playing, the kid is giggling and laughing, and I go from deathly pale to red with blinding rage in quick succession. I take that gun away and denied the sale, it turned into an argument, called the boss, who backed me up as soon as he heard what happened. The thing is, gun stores talk. We called up every other store in 100 miles that sold guns, told them about this, and sent our copies of his licenses to them via email. That kinda blatant negligence may fly in Hicksville out in bumfuck county where idiots think hunting rabbits with an A K is all fine and dandy, but goddamnit we have some fucking standards! I heard all sorts of horror stories from other gun store employees while working there. Ppl very obviously intending to murder, people threatening the clerks, people getting their hands on guns and trying to rob the store with them."
"  a terrifying encounter: A young cafe worker endures a creepy regular customer's unsettling behavior, escalating to a chilling encounter in parking lot.




","Who is the scariest customer you have ever dealt with?

Who is the scariest customer you have ever dealt with? I was 18 and was working a closing shift at a small cafe in a grocery store. One of my regular customers comes in, Tom. Tom was a hugger, he'd come in and call out ""where's my girls?"" and we'd all have to awkwardly hug this 80 year old man while he whispered ""God bless you"" in your ear. I hated Tom. He always held on a little too long and whispered a little too close. On this shift, I was closing alone and Tom came in at about 4 PM. Not unusual, I dealt with the creepy and got him his coffee and bagel. He was with his wife this time, she was sweet but tired looking. He started asking me questions as I worked. What do I have to do at night? Is it hard closing alone? What time am I off? Do I ever get scared walking to my car in the dark? The questions got progressively more uncomfortable and his wife just sat there silently. I answered as friendly as I could, despite the hair on the back of my neck standing up. I would catch him staring at me often. It was okay though, I was off work at 7 so it wasn't a big deal. Until he didn't leave. His wife went home without him, and he just stayed, staring, for hours. I asked if there was anything else he needed, he said no, I'm just waiting for you to get off of work. He wanted to walk me to my car, he said, because young girls shouldn't be in a dark parking lot alone. I told him it wasn't necessary and continued about my work, ignoring him now even as he stared. He left about 15 minutes before my shift ended, into the dark Michigan winter, and I breathed a sigh of relief. I didn't think twice when I punched out and headed to my car. I grabbed my snow brush and began clearing my car, enjoying the quiet that's unique to a snowy night. I began to hear the crunching of footsteps behind me, I brushed it off, I am in a parking lot, after all. But they get closer, past any other car and directly towards my car, parked away from the others in employee parking. I look, and it's Tom, maybe 50 feet away and smiling. He tells me that I should have looked for him, he had been sitting outside waiting for me and I should know it's dangerous for young girls to be alone in a parking lot at night. I began shaking. I tried to open my car door but it was frozen shut due to the earlier storm. Tom came closer, calling me a stupid girl and asking God to forgive him. I debated running back into the store, he was so old he surely couldn't keep up, right? I didn't want to chance it, though. He could have been younger as I'm a terrible judge of age, and I'm not exactly fast myself considering my weight. So I stand my ground. I fumble in my purse for my pepper spray, thankfully attached to my keys. I tell him to stay back, I have pepper spray, and to go home to his wife. He glowers at me. I show him the teal canister. We're about 15 feet apart now, he's well within range. He calls me names, spits at me, and heads back into the store. I get in my half uncovered car and drive home, terrified. I called the store when I got home and told them what had happened. They kicked Tom out and told him not to come back. He began cursing up a storm and his wife had to come pick him up. He ended up getting arrested for possession of explicit content involving children a couple years later, but I don't know the details as I had moved away at that point. Can't say I'm sad to see him go, though."
"  disrespectful guest mistreats person's cats, slapping one, prompting a ban and later harassing another cat at another relative's house.","What’s the most disrespectful thing a guest ever did in your home?

When I was in my late teens, maybe 19, my dad invited his brother and his new mistress-turned-wife and her two brats to our house. We had two cats, but realistically they were my cats because I spent the most time with them, loved them, and took care of them.
I didn't really fit into the conversation, being so young, so I hung in the living room while the older adults were in the kitchen. My uncle's new wife (I can’t bring myself to call her aunt) kids were going NUTS over my cats. They were two boys, 9 and 7, both with behavioral problems. They could not control themselves AT ALL. They did not have manners or any regard for things that weren’t theirs. So I resigned myself to watching them, because I didn’t trust the two little shits around my cats and their mom and my uncle sure weren’t keeping an eye on them. I even made sure to gently warn them, something along the lines of “be nice and gentle, or you’ll spook them”.
So these brats drug all the cat toys I had out and start going crazy trying to get reactions out of my cats. Most cats don’t appreciate a lot of upfront energy like that; they’re not like dogs. So my cats mostly just stared in bewilderment or ignored them. Then I watched one of these little shits reach out and slap my tortoiseshell cat across the head to get her to look at him. It was the 9 year old, who damn well knew better for sure, and he didn’t hold back in his swing. My poor girl was bowled over by it.
I was pissed af. I dragged him up off the floor and told him to leave my cats alone, then effectively banished him and his brother to the kitchen for their lousy guardians to watch them. He’s lucky I didn’t smack him. I’ve never hit a kid, but that would be the thing that drove me to it. After that I made it clear to his parents that their kids weren’t welcome at the house anymore. My mom and dad, who also weren’t fans of the less-than-behaved brats, didn't dissuade me.
A month later, the 9 year old pulled the same harassment towards my grandmother's two cats. Her orange tabby, a sweet little shy girl who was nervous around almost everyone, was terrified out of her mind because the 9 year old was chasing her around my grandparents house. Room to room, he chased her out of all her normal hiding spots that she retreated to when she was overwhelmed. I've never seen that cat as scared as she was. So naturally, I stepped in because my grandmother was too nice to tell her new daughter in laws kids to settle the eff down. He played outside after that.
To me, there’s just nothing more disrespectful than mistreating the pets of your host. Animal abuse in any form is disgusting, but… They’re a part of the family, they should be treated as such, not like living breathing toys or entertainment to throw and break. Ugh."
"  a beloved teacher received daily gifts of pretty white rocks from a student, unaware they were actually crack cocaine.","What is the most inappropriate gift that someone innocently gave a teacher?

My daughter went to private school in elementary school. There was one teacher whom every student wanted to have for First Grade. She was an extremely excellent teacher. Well, one year, this teacher asked for a raise because she had been at the school for 5 years and she was a very popular teacher among students and teachers alike. The head of the school turned down her request and as a result, she left the school to work in the public school system.
Well, as wonderful as she was in the private school she was equally popular in the public school. She cared about each and every student in her class. One particular female student, truly adored this teacher and decided to bring her a present every day. This present was a pretty white rock. The teacher put the rocks one next to the other around the perimeter of her desk. Pretty soon, the teacher had to make a second row of these pretty rocks. But they were pretty and she wanted to honor the student so there they sat on her desk.
One day, the school invited the local police to visit with the students in their classrooms. Just a basic, ""hi, we are your friends, if you ever need help don't be afraid to ask a police officer because we are here to help you. Then they allowed the students to ask questions. After 10 minutes of answering questions, it was time for the students to go outside for recess.
Once the students were outside, one of the policemen pulled the teacher aside and asked her about her rock collection. The teacher, innocently replied, 'they are pretty aren't they? One of my students brings me one every day for a gift.
The policeman said, 'uhm, ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you to point out who this child is and I will have to confiscate all your rocks'.
The teacher looked at him perplexed about what the problem might be, so the policeman explained that those pretty white rocks were crack coca."
"  a person shares their heartbreak of being kept a secret by their girlfriend from a guy who likes her.




","My girlfriend hid me from a guy who has a crush on her.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for a year and four months. For some background information, we broke up once and got together again, the reason being was because the relationship felt toxic and it was harming my mental health, she was being controlling and I've tried my best to please her in every way I can and do everything she wants me to, but it never felt enough. She kept asking for more and more and eventually, it drained me. I cut half of my friends off for her because she was feeling jealous of them, I couldn't spend time with my friends because she wanted all my attention on her, and I just felt like I was constantly walking on eggshells. I stated my concern and she understood me, she made some changes and she improved. This convinced me to go back to her, but it was mostly because I love her. This is where it starts. She told me she met a guy who worked at the café where she often goes, we'll call the guy Kenneth. She would talk about how Kenneth would come up to her and compliment her randomly, and now, to me, this is no surprise. My girlfriend is a gorgeous girl and she has quite the reputation at our place, so she gets compliments all the time and she would often have guys hit on her or try to get with her and it never really bothered me. I trust her a lot and I can't blame those people who like her, I get why they do and I'm just very happy that I'm the one she chose to love. Eventually, let's say they became acquaintances, and I told her that it's good that she's making a new friend and I didn't think much of it nor was I suspicious of anything, so that was that. Soon after that, she told me she had a feeling that Kenneth was manifesting her. I don't know much about manifestations so, I didn't really understand at first. But she explained it to me and told me that she has been thinking of Kenneth a lot more lately, but I trust her and brushed it off thinking that maybe she just randomly thought of him. But this one time, we were having a date and she told me she was thinking of Kenneth. Now, this is what bothered me. I was right in front of her and yet she was thinking of a whole different guy. Of course, this really broke my heart. I called the night off and decided to ask for some space which she agreed to. I spent the whole day gathering my thoughts and feelings to let it go, I was feeling a lot better but when we decided to talk again, she told me she hung out with him that day. This, again, broke my heart. She told me that it was out of her will and that her and Kenneth's friends set her up, I understand of course. It wasn't her choice so I decided to not make a fuss about it, although I was starting to feel jealous so, I told her how I felt but she didn't really seem to care. She acted like it wasn't a big deal. I decided to reach out to a friend of mine, and before any of you say anything, this girl has a boyfriend. I was asking for advice since she seemed to know more about it than I do, I seriously didn't know what to do or how to handle the situation and she gives the best advice. We were discussing it and suddenly she brought this up: “Does Kenneth, his friends, and your girlfriend's friends know about you?”, and this is when it clicked. I never thought of that and it was starting to eat me up inside the more I thought of what my friend said. I decided to confront my girlfriend. I asked her if she ever told Kenneth and everyone else that she has a boyfriend and that boyfriend is me. The silence was so loud. Never, and I mean, never, have I ever heard silence this loud. To sum up her answer, she did not tell them about her status or me. This, now this, really broke my heart. I felt like a fooI. I never would've done this to her, as soon as I meet someone I immediately tell them about my girlfriend. I asked why and she told me, “I thought I made it clear”, when they clearly didn't know. Bullcrap, total bullcrap. She hid me from them and I was extremely upset. The day after that, she decided to fully reject Kenneth and tell him about me. Am I satisfied? No, because it felt like she did it out of guilt and pity. I just need some advice because I don’t know what to do."
"  a couple on a train thwarts attackers by understanding their conversation in Hindi, which they assumed the couple couldn't comprehend.




","What conversations have you overheard in a language they assumed you didn't know? 

Here's one that I overheard, and I live to tell the tale because of it. My wife and I were traveling overnight across north India in an empty train on a not very frequented route. a group of 5 university students boarded our compartment in the early hours of the morning, spotted us, and sat together in a row on a free seat facing us out of the 80 odd other free seats available in the compartment. They spoke in low tones, but I could hear what they were saying and it didn't take very long for me to realize they were talking about us. I pretended to look out of the window and not pay any attention to them. I also whispered to my wife to do the same and ignore them. that pretends saved my life, and perhaps that of my wife as well. The boys conversed in Hindi, which I speak, but which they didn't know. for some obscure reason. I've always been identified as a Sri Lankan or Malaysian, and never as the South Indian that I am. I let people think what they will and these guys probably assumed I was a foreigner. or maybe it didn't even occur to them that I might know their language. In the conversation that I overheard, these boys decided to rush us, knock me out, throw me out of the moving train, and assault my wife. as simple as that. it didn't take them very long to come to that decision as well. Which only goes to prove how psychotic they were. or that they did this before. throwing me out of the running train would have most certainly meant certain death or serious injuries. and once done with her, they were likely to have thrown my wife out of the train as well. I at first thought they were just fantasizing about their course of action, but soon realized they weren't. I whispered to my wife what they were saying, to discreetly take her Swiss knife out of her bag and keep it ready. I also told her when they rushed us, to kick quietly at their groin areas and to slash as many as possible as viciously as she could. We then waited and it didn't take them very long to rush us. and rush us they did. as one man. all 5 of them together. years ago I had been a serious practitioner of taekwondo and had kept in practice with some of its finer close quarter defensive and offensive techniques. My wife and I had also just finished a 6 week long high altitude Himalayan trek and were incredibly fit on top of everything else. I'm pretty big for an Indian, so I was quite confident that I'd be able to take control of the situation. Although my heart was beating like crazy, I waited for them to close in and then I got up in a rush, stepped forward, stood like a rock, and quietly said, the first 2 of them would die really horrible deaths. Hindi is their language. they stopped. They were shocked. I spoke Hindi and had understood them all along. my wife stood behind me with her knife. This was something completely unexpected for them. they just froze. and not one of them took the crucial first step. their plant collapsed in a fraction of the time they'd taken to decide on their extreme action. cowards that they were, they quietly slunk off without a word to the end of the compartment and stepped off at the next station. although giving us baleful looks. That's one adventure I'll never forget. in which was a lesson in itself. There are advantages to keeping some skills secret. especially language skills."
"  ex's relentless denial, false accusations, stalking, and emotional manipulation failed to win man back. A toxic relationship ended, bringing relief.","What’s the Craziest thing an ex said to try and win you back?

When I first tried to break up with her she just kept saying ""no"" until I gave in. She said no for more than 10 minutes. The second time I tried to break up with her she pulled the same trick, but this time ready for it I beat her at her own game and said yes in response. When I got bored of this back and forth, I said ""well it's a yes, so I'm sorry. Good bye."" She then messaged my brother and sister-in-law (whom she had never met), telling them that I needed to call her back right away because she was unstable and didn't know what she was capable of. When my brother told me that I told him to ignore her. She continued to message them saying everything from she was pregnant to ""she deserves better, she deserves me."" After 24 hours of relentlessly contacting my family, a family of 7 total, I turned my phone back on and saw I had 150 texts and 19 voicemails from her. As an aside, this is where I learned an iMessage can only be so long, when it exceeds the maximum character count you have to press on the message and it is opened up on the notes app. When I called her back, she immediately started yelling at me saying things like how dare I, who do you think you are, she deserves better. I told her I would hang up and block her every where I could if she didn't stop yelling at me, I called to have a conversation about why I wanted to break up with her so she could get some closure. She calmed down and in the coolest tone I've ever heard her speak, she told me that she would tell her dad that I was physically and verbally abusive to her if I didn't get back together with her. Her dad was not a particularly big or scary guy, but he works with my dad where I also work and it would have been a career-ender for me if they had believed her. I decided to roll the dice and tell her that her dad knows she has mental issues and there is no way he would believe her. I knew her dad before I knew her so I was 25% confident he would take my side (she did have mental issues). For whatever reason, she believed me and went back to crying and yelling at me. I said good bye, please don't contact me again. After 6 more months of repeated attempts to contact me, I found out she got engaged to some poor guy. I don't know how, who, why, or when it happened but I was happy it was finally over for me. Unfortunately, I was wrong. She will still follow and unfollow my girlfriend and her dogs Instagram account as well as like and unlike 2+ year old pictures on their accounts. She is now married, as of a few months ago, and is still pulling this shit every once in a while. If she wasn't so messed up or if I didn't respect her dad so much I would have contacted the guy she married and told him, but at the end of the day it's just not worth it. I may have handled it poorly, but she was a complete nightmare to date. She had crazy mood swings, would yell at me in front of my family and friends, was incredibly bossy, and we had nothing in common. Only a crazy person would think the relationship was going somewhere."

A little late but there is a girl at my college known for sleeping around a lot. There are a bunch of rumors surrounding her but I know for a fact that she has taken two random guys up to her room on the same night (I worked as a doorman at the time). She wasn't the best student by any means choosing to party over studying or anything like that. About a year ago, I was drunk at a bar and saw her there. She saw me and we talked for a bit and she asked to dance. I'm not the most attractive person by any means, so this had never happened to me. I took her offer, why not, could be fun. After about 4 songs worth of grinding or so, she turns around and gives me this wide eyed look. She quickly says ""I have to go"" and rushes out the door as quick as she could. I assumed she had a moment of clarity and left. I met back up with friends, told them what happened, and we all left a bit later. The next day there is a huge party and apparently she didn't go, people were saying she wanted to study instead. In fact, she didn't go to the bar or any party for the rest of the semester. She made dean's list that semester and is on track to make dean's list this semester too. When I talk about it to my friends, they say she probably hooked up with someone else that night or she went out a different night but I saw her look of shock. I saw her directly leave the bar. I know she didn't go to that party that she would normally go to the very next night. She hit rock bottom by simply dancing with me and it was enough to truly change her life."
"  excessive transformation from rebellious teenager to overzealous religious mother resulted in strict control over her child's life, causing eventual rebellion.","What is the worst case of overprotective parenting that you've ever seen?

My sister turned from a rebellious substance using teenager to a cult like religious mother. My sister was by far the worst I've ever met. She was a typical bad teenager in high school; doing the whole ""I'm 17, I'm grown, you can't tell me what to do"" thing including alcohol, substances, and intimacy (none of which I have any problem with, but probably aren't a good idea if you don't possess the responsibility to deal with them). She got knocked up at 17 by a dude who bailed on her and she took about a ton and a half of reality to the face and decided to turn her life around. Problem is, she swung too far back in the other direction and became a super fundamentalist Christian and chalked her getting knocked up by a transient Mexican farm worker (and literally everything else) to God's plan. After my nephew was born things didn't start to get bad until he was around seven or eight and developed his own personality. She started forcing him to go to church and catechism against his wishes. She also severely restricted the information and media he was allowed access to. Books were restricted solely to the Bible and other religious texts, and educational books so long as they didn't contradict scripture in any way. She refused to allow him to have friends unless she'd vetted them and ensured they came from ""a good Christian family."" Until he was 16, the only television he was allowed to watch was Disney Channel and CNN; she put parental block on everything else. He wasn't allowed to see movies rated above PG or get his driver's licence until he was 18 and she couldn't really stop him anymore. Video games were right out of the question. The end result of his sheltered upbringing was that, as soon as he was a legal adult, he began to rebel against everything she'd ever imposed on him in whatever way he could find. He started intoxicating himself, stopped going to church or any of the religious studies groups she made him go to, and fell in with a group of guys who got him in a fair amount of trouble. Thankfully he's calmed down recently, in his early 20s. He's in college now, still smokes, but not nearly as much as he used to and, to my knowledge, hasn't committed a crime in a few years."

When people come crying to us. Our first inclination is to fix the problem. If we tie down anything in the back of a pickup truck or trailer, it's physically impossible for us not to stand back and say, That's not going anywhere. We really do think your hair is good. It looked good before and after you got a haircut. If look good, Curly. And it looked good straight. It looked good when you woke up and when you made it. As long as it's shaped like the hair we gave girls on stick figures when we were five years old. We think it looks good. I'm a girl and I found out through the years that when guys say something, don't think too much into it. Like, what's the hidden meaning? Don't overthink it. Guys normally say stuff that should be taken at face value. They're not. When you see a guy you don't know or kind of know, but don't really know well enough to talk to walks by. You give a subtle knot of your head which they return. We desperately want you to tatas things instead of just handing them to us. I like hugs. I'm not staring at you.

When I was 13, my very abusive and extremely intoxicated father was swinging at my dog trying to punch him. I pushed him down a flight of stairs, breaking every rib on his left side and punctured lung. Then I went right back to watching Dukes of Hazzard. About 5 hours later, my mom came home. She asks where Dad was. I told her he was laying on a basement floor. Why? He's intoxicated. Of course he must have fell. She went down there and screamed at him for about 20 minutes. But he was mostly unconscious. Then she called my uncle to come and help me carry him upstairs. My dog wouldn't let my uncle anywhere near the old man, despite their earlier altercation. So I had to carry him up by myself. I was a big kid. Anyone with even a tiny bit of first aid knowledge. Me from scouts would know not to do that. I had to sling him in a blanket over my shoulder, Santa Claus style. He then spent the next four days getting sober enough, not sober, to go to the hospital. There he was, properly diagnosed and treated and his lung drained and re inflated while he was able to smoke. Yeah, smoke right there in his hospital bed. They did not provide alcohol on the hospital menu, so he went into withdrawal, delirium, tremors and all kept screaming, Get the goddamned horse off of my bed. How did that horse get in here? That lasted about a week then. And I don't know how this works. The doctors refused to release him from the hospital and moved him to the psych ward. He spent two months or so in there being treated for addiction. During that time, no children, dogs or wives were physically, mentally or emotionally abused at our house. Not once for the first time in about 30 years. Eventually, he was discharged and much to everyone's shock and utter disbelief. He never drank again or hurt his wife or abused his children. His grandchildren absolutely worshiped him and competed for his favor. He was kind and generous and a great source of wisdom and humor for them. In time, they named their own sons after him and have his name tattooed on their flesh. Ultimately, he died of cancer, and when he did, I held him in my arms and looked him in the eyes so he wouldn't be scared or die alone. I was his primary caregiver for the last seven years of his life, and I have zero regrets about my actions that day."

He eventually finished his rant by stating that he would head home after he takes this one last ibn qahba (bad Arabic slur) in his car home. I, of course, didn't drop the ruse and pretended that my Uber driver didn't just loudly and quite needlessly insult me to this random person on the phone. When we finally arrived, he told me to have a nice evening, sir.
I told him ” تصبح علي خير يا روح امك “ (the gist of which is: Goodnight, Jerk) and walked away putting on my best display of being highly offended 
I told him “tusbahu alayya khayrun ya ruha amki” (the gist of which is: Goodnight, Jerk) and walked away putting on my best display of being highly offended, even though I was dying from laughter on the inside, after seeing the look on his face. Weeks later, I took another Uber, driven by Mr. Badri, an Iraqi. He seemed like he had a lot of trouble with English over the phone, so I started the ride off by greeting him in Arabic.
He was quickly at ease and was surprised that I spoke Arabic so fluently for a white. I explained I was only half Egyptian, and that was probably why I didn't look like your stereotypical middle easterner. He laughed and said it reminded him of a story. His Egyptian friend, also an Uber driver, told him about the time he picked up this white guy that turned out to speak perfect Arabic.
I asked him his friend's name. It was Abdel-Latif."
"  a woman catches a dishonest mechanic in a series of lies after he mishandles her husband's car, seeking justice in court.","What was the most satisfying lie you caught someone in?

Husband’s car wouldn’t go in reverse, so he took it to a local mechanic. I had been to that mechanic in the past with my car and he was trying to charge me for a $3,000 part/work that turned out to be a simple loose bolt. Whew! Glad I got a second opinion on that one! So…I didn’t trust him, but my husband thought he’d be ok.
Husband was without a car far longer than the time the mechanic had said - about a couple weeks. Mechanic kept telling the husband…should be tomorrow….two days….next week. Total run around.
Finally I took my husband down there and the car wasn’t there. I asked the mechanic where the car was. He didn’t know. HUH? He said he had someone pick it up to fix it.
I asked, “Who is the guy and where is the car?”
Somewhere in the neighboring town. That’s all he knew. He said he didn’t know how to get to that town, which I knew was a lie. Anyone who lived in the area as long as I knew he had, would know how to get to that town.
I asked, “You let someone take our car, without telling us, and you don’t know where it is?”
Are.you.serious?
Husband was really upset but I said “Let’s go” and we drove straight down to the police station. We shared the story and we were told that the mechanic was probably getting ready to sell the car because they'd had multiple complaints against him.
An officer followed us back to the shop and asked the mechanic about the car. The officer got pretty much the same answers we did but told him he needed to have that car back in 24 hours or he’d be charged with auto theft.
Next day, the husband got a call: the car was back and fixed at close to $4,000.
Just a few days after picking it up, the original problem with the transmission happened again. We had the car towed to our home and I filed a complaint with small claims court for our money back plus court costs.
The court date came and the mechanic actually showed up! That was a surprise. He came and talked to us and said he was selling property in California and would be able to pay us the money but not that day. We went with him to speak to the judge who told him he’d have a month to get the money and set a new court date.
New court date came, and my husband got a call from him. The mechanic said his father passed away in California and he was out there so he wouldn’t be in court.
We went to court, told the judge what he told us, and the judge said he’d give him the benefit of the doubt and set a third court date.
After leaving court, I dropped my husband off at work and, on the way home, went right to the mechanic’s shop. He was standing outside smoking a cigarette. I turned around and drove in. He was nowhere to be found, but I asked one of the employees if he was there. Employee said yes….and went with me looking for him. I was not about to leave. He was hiding in the bathroom and I was going to stay there if it took all day and night.
Finally he came out and I had my phone's video on. I told him I was so sorry to hear that his dad died, but I suspected the judge would be very interested in what I had to show him. Then I turned and walked to my car.
He came running after me and said, “Meet me at the bank, I’ll have your money.”
Which I did…and…he did."
"  man plans spicy engagement party for girlfriend who lied about liking spicy food, resulting in tears, vomiting, and strained relationship.","What is the worst lie your partner has told you?

All our relationship I believed that my girlfriend likes spicy foods. She told me that a long time ago and she frequently orders the spicy options, such as spicy chicken from pei wei. She's kind of known for enjoying spicy foods and will sometimes order chili margaritas and the like. We've been together for three years ingot engaged a couple months ago. I planned an engagement party for the two of us by making a party reservation at a restaurant well known in our area for serving the spiciest dishes of all time. So I have it set up where it is an 8 course coarse meal and they bring us food increasing in spiciness. I invited all of our friends to this party and her family as well. My family is not around. My father actually left us when we were kids to marry another woman but that is another story. He later sent us a post card leaving an address to his home in Italy but after trying to send him mail we discovered that address didn't exist. So I invite everyone and have them hide out in another room until the 3rd course when I would wave them over to surprise her and finish the coarses with us. I couldn't afford to let everyone eat 8 courses. That actually turned out not in my favor because they made me rent out the event room where they were all hiding. Should've just had them all at the table but hindsight is twenty twenty. So my fiance didn't know the reputation of this place and I wanted to surprise her to find out they were spicy foods. Everything was going great and she was so excited that I'd finally made time to properly celebrate our engagement. Well right around the 3rd dish I guess the spice started to kick in because she turned really red and started coughing a lot. This is the point that everyone ran out to give her gifts and to congratulate us. Well my fiance at this point is spluttering a lot but she is telling people she is so happy they are here and to watch out for spicy food. I genuinely thought she was having a great time because she told me she loves spice so much. They bring out the fourth coarse and man this one is spicy as hell.  My fiance began trying to eat it and at this point she just burst into tears out of nowhere. We were all baffled and her mom tried to comfort her but my fiance just screams at me that she doesn't even like spices. She then ran out into the parking lot and I followed to comfort her and ask why she lied and she threw up in the parking lot. She then ordered a taxi and refused to let me inside. I had to get a ride home with her mom because I was out of money due to the event room I explained about earlier. All this happened 2 days ago and I can't get my fiance on the phone. She hasn't come home and her mother tells me that she is okay but she is sick and wants to be alone. I don't know what to do at this point."
  a cat conflict at work: Teaching a simple orange cat leads to accusations of ethnic stereotypes. Sensitivity training demanded.," Am I the A-hole for “perpetuating ethnic stereotypes” about Jorts?

Am I the A-hole for “perpetuating ethnic stereotypes” about Jorts? We have two workplace cats in one area of our worksite. They add value to the worksite, we all love the cats and the worksite cat presence is not the issue. One of the cats (Jean) is a tortoiseshell cat we have had for years. The other cat (Jorts) is a large orange cat and a recent addition. Jorts is just… kind of a simple guy. For example, Jorts can’t open a door even when it’s ajar— he shoves it whether he is going in or out, so often he closes the door he is trying to go through. This means he is often trapped inside the place he was trying to exit and meows until he is rescued. My colleague Pam (not her real name) has been spending a lot of time trying to teach Jorts things. The door thing is the main example — it’s a real issue because the cats are fed in a closet and Jorts keeps pushing the door closed. Jean can actually open all the other interior doors since they are a lever type knob, but she can’t open this particular door if she is trapped INSIDE the closet. Tortie Jean is very nice to poor orange Jorts, and she is kept busy letting him out of rooms he has trapped himself in, so this seems easy to resolve. I put down a door stop.  Pam then said I was depriving Jorts of the “chance to learn” and kept removing the doorstop. She set up a series of special learning activities for Jorts, and tried to put these tasks on the whiteboard of daily team tasks (I erased them). She thinks we need to teach him how to clean himself better and how to get out of minor barriers like when he gets a cup stuck on his head, etc. I love Jorts but he’s just dumb af and we can’t change that. Don’t get me wrong— watching her try to teach Jorts how to walk through a door is hilarious, but Jean got locked in the closet twice last week. Yesterday I installed a cat cutout thing in the door and Pam started getting really huffy. I made a gentle joke about “you can’t expect Jean’s tortoiseshell smarts from orange cat Jorts” which made Pam FURIOUS. She started crying and left the hallway, then sent an email to the group (including volunteers) and went home early. In her email Pam said I was “perpetuating ethnic stereotypes by saying orange cats are dumb” and is demanding a racial sensitivity training before she will return. I don’t think it’s relevant but just in case, Pam is a white person in a mostly minority staff (and no she is not ginger/does not have red hair)."
"  person keeps secret about partner's accidental purchase of a fake opal necklace to avoid hurting their feelings.




","Other than cheating, what secret do you keep from your SO to prevent upsetting them? 

The first Christmas after I got together with my partner, he brought me a beautiful opal necklace. He knew it was my favorite stone. I suspect he paid quite a bit.
He's mad proud of the thing and loves to see me wear it. He told me that when he brought it he paid for a slightly smaller opal, and the shop worker accidentally grabbed the wrong one so he got an upgrade to a bigger opal for free!
My partner also has a whole thing against fake stones in jewelry, thinks it tacky, horrible, dishonest etc. Long story short, what he doesn't realize is that my beautiful opal IS fake.
See I suspect he paid for a real opal. But he probably wasn't meant to see that when the shop worker grabbed the bigger one. I suspect they ran a little con on him, charged him for a smaller real one and grabbed the larger fake instead. He thought the accident was in his favor so he never complained.
I only know 1) The play of color and size in the opal I have would have cost a small house deposit if it had been real and there is no way he brought that as a uni student when we first go together and 2) A real opal would never have stood up to the wear and tear I have put it though - I literally never take it off, it comes for me on runs, in the salt water, in the shower etc all things that would have destroyed a real opal many years ago. 3) A friend brought a pair of earrings that matched my necklace (not on purpose) and she confirmed that my necklace and her earrings made up the store's imitation opal birthstone set.
I love that f’ing stone. I don't wear much jewelry, but I haven't taken that necklace off in three years. I have literally told him that if we get married one day, I'm having the thing pulled off the necklace and set into a ring (that's gonna be an awkward conversation with a jeweler).
If I told him he'd probably feel really bad about it and want to get me a replacement. But I love the stupid things so I won't tell."
"  a birthday party is organized by mom, no classmates showed up. Staff and random kids made it memorable and heartwarming. Best day at work.","Waiters, what's the saddest ""I'm waiting for someone"" you have seen?

Waiters, what's the saddest ""I'm waiting for someone"" you have seen?
I used to work birthdays at a science museum.
So, one weekend, the birthday family arrives, I escort them back to their room as usual and start talking with the mom about how she wants things to go, setting up the room, etc. She mentions that they just moved here and her son doesn't have many friends yet. So they invited one cousin about their son's age, and then just invited the kid's entire (2nd grade maybe? ) class to the party.
An hour goes by and the little cousin has shown up, but nobody else. The little dude invited every kid in his class and not one of them showed up.
Now to be honest, the birthday boy himself didn't seem that concerned. He and his cousin were happily playing with each other the whole time. I just don't think he was really that warmed up to the kids in his class to begin with.
But the mom was heart broken. She had set this party up for her son, had bought a birthday package that included a private room, general admission for all guests, and me taking a dewar of liquid nitrogen to the room and making ice cream for the party, she had high hopes for this. And nobody showed. And she was in tears.
And she asked me to go out the museum and just invite random kids in to her son's birthday party. Just so that there would be at least some other kids for him to play with.
And this is the part that I'll never forget.
We found a half dozen kids who were interested in coming to the party. And the mom was very grateful to them.
But word also got out to the staff. And the staff absolutely rallied around this kid.
Other employees showed up to sing him happy birthday. Some staffers went to the gift shop to buy him gifts. One of my managers got the family vouchers for future admission. We have a mascot, a ""robot"", who will walk around and play with guests, and he showed up to the party with some gifts from our gift shop. I brought down the materials for making a couple of different types of home-made slime, and made slime with the kids. One of my coworkers, one of the smartest and kindest people I've ever met, spoke with the mom about the son's interests, and discovers the birthday boy is a fan of the Avengers. So he goes back to where we have a laser-etcher on display, and comes back with a wood-burning that is a picture of the Avengers wishing the son ""Happy Birthday"".
By the end of the party, the mom was in tears again, but for a very different reason. A few days later she she sent us the sweetest letter about how much it all meant to her.
I worked 3 to 5 birthdays a weekend, every weekend, for about 5 years, and they were always fun. But that was the absolute BEST day at work I've ever had."

I have this Roommate and we’ve been living together for a few months. He is pretty depressed and keeps to himself most of the time. He works from home and doesn’t leave the house much. I’m depressed too. One night we were the only two people home and I got intoxicated and went and bothered him and knocked on his door and chatted him up. Then that happened again another night. Then I feel I started to get him out of his shell. He started to open up to me about his life. We went on a day trip together. We started doing small things together like going to the store. Then yesterday we were both home and I was having a bad day, and so was he so he knocked on my door to talk and we talked for hours, I cried, we laughed so hard until our stomachs hurt. Then he asked last night if I wanted to sleep with him. No intimacy, just sleep. He said he didn’t want me to be alone. We layed in his bed and talked until like 3 A M About everything. Life, hardships, dreams, fears. We laughed a lot. Then we fell asleep. Nothing happened but that. And honestly I think this is the purest friendship I’ve ever had. He is afraid of people hurting him and getting close to people, but I care about him so much and hope he really knows that."
"  during pregnancy, the biological father asked the mother to get an abortion after showing interest and involvement in the pregnancy.","Mothers, what's the rudest thing you’ve heard during pregnancy?

It was my daughter's biological father who said it. We had been in a relationship for a few years and I stopped taking birth control because I started getting ovarian cysts and it made my periods much worse than usual. At first we used rubbers but eventually started having unprotected intercourse, we knew I could get pregnant and had talked about it, we weren't necessarily trying but we were ready if it happened. Neither one of us were surprised when I got pregnant a few months later. Well as my pregnancy progressed he started staying out late and sometimes not even coming home, at around 15/16 weeks I found out he'd been cheating. He told me he thought he was ready for the commitment and responsibility but as time passed he realized it wasn't what he wanted. I was hurt and called my mom, she was more than happy to have me back home for the birth of her first grandchild. It softened the blow tremendously and she gave me the two bedrooms my brothers had growing up because they were connected and one could be the nursery. I stayed in contact with him and he even came to the gender reveal ultrasound at 20 weeks and we found she's a girl, it seemed like he was coming around to the idea of being a father. Two weeks later he texts me and asks if he can come by to talk to me about something. He'd been really active on Facebook, commenting and liking everything I posted baby related. I figured he wanted to be there for the baby. I even entertained the idea of us getting back together. When he arrived I invited him in and showed him the nursery my dad had painted pink a few days before. Standing in my daughter's nursery he asked me to get an abortion, I was shocked. I was 22 weeks pregnant. I didn't even think you could get an abortion that late. Then he goes on to tell me he found out they can do it up to 24 weeks, it'll cost $8,000. That's when I realized he was serious and had researched this, I was pissed off. He says ""well, I thought you were pro-choice."" I can't remember exactly what I said but it was something along the lines of ""I am! But, this isn't like we're staring at a pregnancy test. I'm more than half-way through my pregnancy! We know she's a girl, she has a name, we're standing in her nursery next to her effing crib! I feel her kicking right now! It's too late for that!"" I told him to leave and a few other nasty things. It wouldn't have made me so mad if he didn't know how much I loved my baby, if he didn't go to the gender reveal ultrasound, if he hadn't been following the entire pregnancy online or if he didn't have his hand on my stomach just a few minutes prior trying to feel her kick. A few days later he texted me to apologize and said he realized it was effed up to ask me to do that so late in my pregnancy, we came up with an agreement that I wouldn't seek child support and he wouldn't seek custody and had it notarized."
"  person's boyfriend's past was revealed during family dinner, causing discomfort. Person feels guilty but unsure about addressing the situation.




","I introduced my boyfriend to my family and they blindsided him during dinner

I have been dating this guy for 9 months now. He’s amazing and I’m head over heels for him and he’s the same for me. My boyfriend had a tough past, he had a rough upbringing and spent some time in prison over a decade ago. Once he got out, he turned things around and managed to build a very good life for himself. I found out about his past on our third date. I asked him about a small tattoo on his arm, which turned out to be a tattoo of the date he was released from prison. None of that mattered to me because it was in the distant past. I briefly mentioned it to my sister one day and did not go into any details about it. My sister and I have always shared things about the guys we date and I always thought it would stay between us. Or so I thought. On Sunday, I introduced my boyfriend to my parents for the first time. We went over to their house for dinner and everything was going well until my dad brought up at the dinner table the fact that my boyfriend had spent time in jail. It blindsided my boyfriend and I did not tell them about it beforehand so I immediately realized it must have been my sister. My parents proceeded to question him about all that, asking why he was in there and making jokes like “it takes a certain someone to go to jail” and “you don’t go to jail for no reason”. Those things were said in a “jokingly” way but it felt condescending and I’m sure my boyfriend felt it too. We ended up cutting dinner short and I had an individual conversation with my dad and basically told him that what they did wasn’t cool and that I was mad. He kept saying they were joking but it didn’t feel that way. I apologized to my boyfriend on our way home and he just said “it’s okay babe. it’s to be expected”. He said it in a defeated way which told me that he was hurt. He never said this to me, but I imagine that being judged over one’s past, especially when you’ve built a great life for yourself, must feel awful. I feel so guilty for all of this and although he seems fine, I feel like it affected him more than he wants to tell me. I don’t know what to do. I regret not being more vocal when all of it was happening, I’m not good at confrontations. I’ve been thinking of calling my parents and telling them they need to apologize to him as soon as possible but my sister (who I confronted) says I should let some time pass and make them apologize next time we see each other which is god knows when. What should I do?"

Years ago my girlfriend (we'll call deb) and I were out with her friend (we'll call Sara). This one day Sara had to pin unlock her phone each time to take one of many pictures..out the corner of my eye I saw her pin. I saved it in a note. Months later sara and deb were at my place and went to the pool. Sara left her phone indoors. I used her password and hit jackpot. Nudes, videos, message logs with some guy she was talking (well call jeff) to, along with tons of peepee picks and videos of him jacking off. Now deb was hot but sara was a fat chick that worked her butt off and became a 11/10. With this goldmine of pics and vids I concocted a slow plan.very slow. Slowly I broke off with deb but kept in touch with sara. I then created a alter ego online (we'll call it Vanessa). For months I worked this identity so it looked real. This identity started following Sara on all social media (Sara accepted any friend requests). Vanessa blackmailed jeff. Jeff was given 2 days to stop talking to sara or his peepee picks got leaked. He was chicken crap and dropped her like a hot potato. But Sara was strong-willed.when Vanessa threatened sara to stop talking to jeff or her pics get leaked she protested.so I knew I had to change tactics. Vanessa disappeared for a while until I could get Sara's phone in my hands for a bit. One day sara was over and ""lost"" her phone at my place. I ""found"" it for her the next day. Not before I installed a spy app that let me keep track of her everything. A few weeks later Vanessa came back but now armed with the conversations sara was having with everyone. While tracking Sara's reactions and suspicions, I made it show that Vanessa wasnt real. Now all my friends know me as being pretty tech literate. One day im talking with Sara and she breaks down crying telling me how she been long distance texting this guy intimately and somebody hacked his or her phone and now shes being blackmailed by some stranger she doesn't know. So she askes me if I could help her. Long ending short I made it look like jeff was Vanessa. I made it look like he created this person so that he could blackmail Sara into screwed up intimacy stuff. Sara left him and guess who was the hero? Me. I caught ""Vanessa"". Sara was now safe because of me. Once we blackmailed the guy, "" Vanessa"" disappeared. You know. for realism. Sara and I now had this tragedy. this hurdle that we overcame together. We started dating not long after. She was never going back to long distance relationships and wanted to try local. 4 years later were married."

I slapped my ex girlfriend as hard as I could. I used to be an extreme extrovert guy. I was friends with pretty much whole school. I didn’t have any bad habits except for gaming which is usual for teenagers. I madly fell in love with my best friend. She wasn’t on board initially but we had pretty strong connection in terms of communication so she agreed to give it a shot during our undergrad days. She used to be very conservative person and started having insecurities with my lady friends. I assured her that there won’t be any other than her in my life. She would understand momentarily but we would get back to sqaure one real soon. To make things worst, I had dated her then best friend during high school. Our foundation of relationship itself was built on insecurities I guess. I didn’t want to lose her at any cost. I tried my best to save the relationship. She literally started having problems with every women I was friends with. For the sake our time together and our future, I totally stopped talking to other women. There remained only my childhood best friend whom I would talk to other than my ex. Suddenly, my ex started having problems with her as well. I was never a control freak so this territory was unfamiliar for me. I never said a word about her acquaintances. (Although they were garbage people and even she realises that now.) Her friends used to turn her against me and she would trust them over me even though she knew every bit and piece of my life. That made me more miserable. On a gloom summer evening, we got into heated argument about not going to a concert together. She started trash talking about me and my best friend having a fling behind her back. At that point, I’ve had enough. I loved her to death and even she did. But, I was deep into depression and financial problems at that time. I couldn’t take the crap anymore. I’ve had attempted ending it all once by that time. We were best friends but she never understood me the way I thought she would. I lost control in the moment and slapped her. I apologized and tried to get the things sorted between us. But, it was never the same again. I tried relentlessly to make things work. I loved her but it wasn’t working out for her. After 6 years in relationship, we broke up. Lately, even she realized that what she did was wrong and I too acted impulsively. I guess we both were immature. If I had controlled myself that evening, may be we’d have been still together and we would be celebrating our 7th year anniversary next week on November 10. She wanted to remain friends but it was not possible for me and we went our separate ways."

I was selling dirt zaza in college, not making money but basically just flipping enough so that I could smoke up all the time for free. I was a freshman and getting QP's on the arm from a fellow student who was a senior, tough kid too, wouldn't ever want to mess with him. Anyway, I owed him about $650, which I had along with a brand-new piece of glass and a Zip of personal stash. At this time one of my regulars came by to grab something, cool kid, I had known him since we met at orientation and we both were pretty similar so I really had no reason to distrust him after six months. He came into my dorm and I gave him what he was asking for and then put everything back in a safe under the bed. He asked me and my roommate if we wanted to go smoke with him down by the dock. Of course we did. So we all walked down to the docks and were smoking a blunt with the stuff I just gave him. About a minute after he lit the blunt he said he wanted to grab a friend to join us and handed me the blunt and took off. So me and my roommate shrugged and just kept smoking this kid's blunt. After about ten minutes it hit me like a ton of bricks, I didn't even explain to my roommate, I just booked it as fast as I could run back to our dorm. I get there and the door is wide open, the safe was pried out of the linoleum and everything was gone. I wound up getting a pretty severe butt-kicking from the kid who was fronting me, as I had no way to pay him back anything. It started getting pretty serious and I got out of there due to other circumstances but I'll never forget that. The smug smile that kid gave me when I saw him the next day. I tried to confront him but he immediately got loud and aggressive and I backed down. I still have dreams that maybe now, almost ten years later, I will see him randomly walking down the street and cleaning his clock. I will say this, my roommate was a great guy, standing up for me, wanting to fight my battles for me. I told him it wasn't worth it, it was just trees and the whole thing was so crappy I didn't want any more involvement. A week or so later my roommate comes back from class with the biggest smile on his face, ""Did you see Danny's car?"" (Danny was the name of the kid who took me). I didn't know what he was talking about so he showed me; all four side windows were smashed, both mirrors, taillights and damage to the hood, all on his brand-new Audi. I looked at my roommate and was about to ask him if he did that but before I could even open my mouth he just looked at me and said, ""He shouldn't have effed with you. That looks like about $1000 worth of damages, wouldn't you say?"""
"  a mischievous combat medic convinces fellow soldiers that unlabeled chapstick contains nicotine, later tricks them into sprinting for cover.","What's the dumbest thing you tricked someone into believing?

During my second deployment to Iraq in 2009, I was a Combat Medic attached to an armored platoon. There were seventeen of us, with only less than half of us being combat veterans. This is the norm with most units going overseas. We trained in Kuwait for two weeks in preparation for going up north. A few days after our arrival at Camp Buehring, otherwise known as the very local where the world stops, we were issued a few things: Helmet lights, new gloves, additional medical supplies and a few weeks worth of chapstick. The chapstick was in a blue container with no label whatsoever. One of the privates was pretty intrigued with the lack of a label and was asking around if anything knew why it didn't come with one. Everyone basically ignored him, except for me. He found me squaring away my aid bag by myself and asked. I replied with something like ""Oh, that's chapstick with a bit of nicotine in it. It's not the same amount a single cigarette has, but it's enough to get you by. It's meant for you to take on patrol where you can't smoke for fear of being spotted by the enemy."" Dude was ecstatic. He went and found his Gunner and informed him of his new nicotine stick. All I heard was a distant ""Seriously?! Who the hell told you that, and why are you stupid enough to believe that?"" I didn't hear anything for a second, but it was shortly followed with a loud ""Doc, freaking really!?"" A few weeks later, I convinced the same Private that once we landed at the airfield in Mosul, he was to run his butt off to the nearest bit of cover. I told him snipers usually kept a keen eye on airfields because they're wide open, making it easy to pick dudes off. Turns out he told a few of the other new Privates. As soon as the ramp went down on the C-130 and the crew chiefs allowed us to unload, those dudes hauled booty across that tarmac. A SAW gunner tripped during the rush, and one of the other FNG's turned around to go get him. The Private yelled to him ""Don't worry about me! Just go! I'll cover you!"" He proceeded to set up his SAW and started to load it before we could intervene. All in view of the CO and 1SG. I think my punishment was a bit light (mostly because I was Doc), but it could have been worse. I just pulled a few extra TOC/radio guard shifts for a few weeks."
"  person reminisces about the past and the changing perception of homie kisses, celebrating camaraderie and the beauty of shared moments.","What are your thoughts on kissing the homies goodnight?

When I was 13 years old a buddy of mine tried to convince me to fool around. I wasn't into it, and he told me it's not gay if you're wearing socks. I didn't believe him, went home, and asked my dad. That's 'gentleman's gay', hardly gay at all. Don't see it much these days. The 50s were a different time. What were we to do? We were typical boarding school boys, rich with vigor, skin slick with drying sweat and gritty earth from a game of pigskin. At night our young, virile bodies filled the dorm with sweet-musky vapors, like game-meat stewed with apple and peppercorn. You'd awake in darkness to the hushed, melodic rhythm of two pairs of white tube socks, barely visible in moonlight, bouncing on the hardwood floor. The deep bond of male friendship played like a thousand different human instruments. The wet claps of skin on skin, the gentle thud of heads on backboards, frenzied cries in the throes of climax. Wilbur, so fat and soft like tapioca pudding. His breasts were so like the real thing, what we fantasized of our future wives. Unwilling, defenseless Wilbur, so slow and uncoordinated in the dark. 10 of us would glaze his bare, pink flesh like a giant raspberry danish. He once had the audacity to tell Headmaster Redford. But Redford was a Deerfield boy once, he understood. So he joined us on our midnight hog hunts. Through college and years after we'd find time here and there, away from the wives at a family lake house. But it's been decades now - the times have certainly changed. If you wanted to do something private with another man, in your socks, it wasn’t ‘gay’. It was just two men, celebrating each other's strength. It was simply a beautiful moment celebrated and shared by men."
  tired midwife witnesses father's emotional rollercoaster: from tears to uncontainable joy upon seeing his newborn twin daughters.,"Midwives, what was the best reaction from a new father?

It was the buttend of my shift and I was tired. I'd been on for twelve hours and I wanted to go home, but an extremely pregnant lady was just wheeled in to admission. I saw this and groaned a bit, because I knew I was going to have to help. So, about seven hours later the doctor, another nurse, and I are sitting in a delivery room watching this chick's snatch vomit up a baby. I've seen this several times before, you know? Comes with the job description. Anyway, the head was crowning and the dad (who had been there the entire time comforting the crap out of his wife and just being an absolutely amazing husband) is just hunkered down watching this baby be born while holding his wife's hand. The first baby is out. It's a girl. He nods and keeps watching. Second baby is out, also a girl. He nods. After we let the mom hold the girls we took them to the nursery while the mom got situated, you know the drill. Dad disappeared. I didn't see him for another hour and a half, and I assumed he went home to shower or nap while the wife's parents looked after everything here My shift was over, so I got my crap out of my locker and started to head home. On a whim, I decided to pass by the nursery to take a look at the twins I helped deliver. The dad was standing there with this really weird look on his face. Another nurse told me the guy had been standing there for about two hours just looking at his kids. I asked him if he was okay, and he said, 'Yeah. Looks like I'm a dad now.' and then burst into some really heavy sobs. I freaked out a little bit and tried to console him, but he quit just as fast as he started and his expression changed to that of pure, unbridled joy. He apologized and then told me he was so excited to know who his little girls were going to be that he just couldn't stop looking at them."
"  family betrayal unfolds as grandfather's siblings feign care during his decline, abandoning him and disrespecting his memory at the funeral.","What made you cut off your family?

So a number of years back my grandfather had a stroke (no one knew it was a stroke til 2 or 3 years later) while he was refurbishing his '32 Chevy, which he treated better than his family. Eventually he starts to deteriorate and can no longer care for himself and my grandmother can no longer do it by herself. In comes my brother who closes down the business he just opened in order to be his full-time caregiver. I helped as much as I could, but I lived 4 hours away at the time finishing up college. Occasionally, his brothers and sister would come to visit, but for no more than 20 minutes before they had to scurry out the door for ""important business"" all the while telling him how much they loved him. Eventually he passes away in a peaceful manner surrounded by my family (I'm still away at this point) and reconciles with them for all the crap he had put them through. In comes his siblings who (once again) shriek like banshees while mourning his death as if they had done everything to care for him. They did not, however, my grandfather said I took care of him more often than they did and I was a full time student who lived 4 hours away. Then comes the wake (or open casket viewing for those who may not know), where his family puts on a show for everyone to show their ""love"" in a public setting. Eventually things slow down and my grandmother thinks it would be nice to share our fond memories of him with those who have gathered to show their support, which we do. However, when my grandmother gets up to speak, they begin to chatter amongst themselves and abruptly leave in the middle of her speech. This was the last straw for my father who confronted them and told them they would no longer be able to carry his casket to lay him to rest. The following day at the funeral things went eerily smooth, although they did the whole banshee wails again for attention, but other than that it was peaceful. Then comes the final goodbyes before we lay him down to rest. All of the sisters thought it would be great to write a joint letter to my brother and grandmother who took care of him in his final days and ""speak their minds"". The gist of the letter was that they ended him, neglected him and ignored him which led to his death. Also included was a jab at my nephew (who was 2 at the time) stating that if my brother cared for his son like he cared for my grandfather, he would have another tinier casket to deal with in the near future. They ended the letter telling us to repent of our sins and to ask God for forgiveness unless we wish to burn in hell. We don't speak much anymore with that side of the family."
"  the person's insecurity led them to wrongly accuse their spouse of cheating, which resulted in a toxic relationship and eventual divorce.","When were YOU the problem?

I suspected my wife of cheating and had the feeling for some time so when she received a late-night text, while she was sleeping, I decided I needed to check her phone. The text was from a known friend and was typical so no big deal, but I chose to scan through previous ones just to... I guess see if there was anything. I wasn't opening them, just skimming to see if there were any obvious signs. Not too far in I found a number I didn't recognize and didn't have any name attached. There were all these romantic texts saying things like we never had enough time and stuff like that. I was upset and couldn't decide if I should wake her or confront her the next day after having thought things over. About an hour or so later I heard her get up to use the bathroom so without giving it much thought I went to her. After a little small talk I asked her who the hell the number was. She paused and stared at me, and it was then I had my answer. I told her about the texts I found and repeated some of them. I explained why I was going through her phone. And she laughed at me. She said they were song lyrics she had sent to herself to look up later (this was pre-smartphone) and that I'm a dummy for not knowing his own wife's phone number. I pulled my phone out and, sure enough, hers was the number I had found. I was, indeed, a dumbass. And now a snooping prick. At this point I was in such a bad place mentally that my pride could not handle the fact I had made a mistake. I decided instead of owning up to it, I would keep accusing her of cheating. I told her she probably left that there to distract me from older texts of her cheating on me. I screamed at her about this until she cried telling me she was sorry and she won’t do it again. I regret how I acted. She kept her phone locked after that and we happily divorced soon after."
"  after witnessing her friend's questionable behavior, including attempts to cheat, infidelity, and self-destructive actions, the person decided to cut ties.","Why did you drop your best friend?

A few years ago, a female friend introduced me to her new boyfriend and we got along right away. Great guy. They ended up having a son together, and then getting engaged. My girlfriend (now wife) went to her bachelorette party but ended up leaving early because she was uncomfortable with the way the party was going and the things my female friend was trying to get her to do (softcore s xual stuff with other guys at the bar, etc.) At that point, I decided that I wasn't all that fond of my female friend anymore, since she'd been trying to get my girlfriend to cheat on me. We decided not to go to her wedding, but I was still nice to her when she'd show up to various outings with mutual friends. Then we all found out that she cheated on her husband a lot. As I said above, this was a great guy who had everything that any woman could ask for. He was hard-working, good-looking, a great father, and head over heels for his wife. He was crushed that she had cheated on him for so long, and was trying to figure out what to do about it. then she posted a ""goodbye world"" message on Facebook and disappeared. Police were called, nobody could find her for hours. She finally turned up at a local hospital, having overdosed on a bottle of pills in a club bathroom. Remember, for all her faults, this is a woman with a young son who depends on her. So we all gathered around her, helped get her back on her feet, her husband decided to stay with her because of ""in sickness and health"" vows, etc. We're all there for her. Then she decides to start clubbing again. Drinking, substances, running out with guys who aren't her husband, the whole deal. All over again. So her husband leaves. He's done everything he can possibly do, but he can't help her if she won't help herself. So less than 24 hours later, she's at the gym and decides to steal credit cards from the women's locker room and go on a shopping spree at Wal-Mart. She's immediately caught, and claims she had to do it because her ex-husband had cleared out the bank accounts. This was not true...he hadn't touched the money. She goes to court, has to pay a fine, etc. Less than 24 hours later, she tries to end herself again. At this point, I was officially done with this friend and wanted nothing to do with her, but our other friends held another intervention. Two weeks later, she's posting pics of herself clubbing again, so I unfriended her on Facebook. And three days ago? After all of this happened? Her husband announced on Facebook that they're back together again."
"  parent accidentally finds son's stolen underwear collection, leads to difficult conversation and concerns about his behavior.","Nosy parents of teenagers. What do you wish you shouldn't have seen? 

My son is very honest with me, so I've never felt the desire to snoop on him. Over the summer, I was looking for my tape measure, and remembered that I'd asked him to measure the space above his desk for shelving. I went into his room (he was away at camp for a couple of weeks) and looked high and low before spotting the tape measure under his desk. I couldn't comfortably reach it because of how the desk was constructed, so I pulled the desk away from the wall. While doing so, I heard a soft thud. After I'd created enough of a clearance to shimmy between the wall to the back of the desk, I saw the gift box that we'd wrapped his birthday present in, splayed on the floor with what appeared to be an assortment of fabrics. Upon closer inspection, I saw what the ""fabrics"" really were - a box of washed and unwashed women's underwear. I put the desk back, but couldn't recreate how the box was situated before. After thinking about what to do, I decided to broach this with him when he returned. More than anything else, I wanted to be sure he wasn't doing anything dangerous (so many thoughts ran through my mind, the strongest being that he was somehow buying them from or bartering with girls at school...). When he came home, I told him that I needed to talk to him. He seemed nervous, and as soon as I mentioned the tape measure he started to cry. He knew I'd found the box and was crying not because of that, but because he thought that I'd found out that he was stealing his best friend's mother's underwear, from his best friend's mother. I'm not sure why he arrived at that conclusion, but such is the mind of my 13-year-old. It turned out that over about 20-month period, he'd taken to swiping my wife's coworker's (mother of his best friend) underwear from her laundry basket, hamper, and even her bedroom drawer whenever he had a chance. There was a total of eleven pairs of underwear. It took me a few days to have a heart-to-heart with him, and it was one of the most difficult conversations I'd ever had to have with him Maybe I stopped him from engaging in progressively more perverted behavior, maybe not. I just hope that he doesn't go down a path like that again, and that his intimate proclivities manifest themselves in more natural and non-illicit ways."
"  EBD student has severe meltdown in classroom, threatens students with objects, chases class across school, while staff struggles to intervene.","Teachers. What has been the most horrifying moment in your classroom? 

An EBD (emotional behavior disorder) student in my class had a meltdown and began walking across student desks. I called for help as is protocol, and that set her off. She began dropping things on students heads and kicking things off desks. She began threatening students with sharpened pencils and throwing scissors across the room. I began evacuating the classroom since I deemed the situation unsafe for my students, and we aren’t allowed to touch students acting in this way if we aren’t trained. This really set her off and she began screaming in students’ faces nonsense words. By this point, my other students are terrified. The help arrives in the form of two EBD personnel and a principal. They also conclude the class needs to be evacuated. We finally get the whole class in the hallway, but she just follows us out there. Since admin and EBD staff haven’t ruled this as threatening yet, they don’t try and hold her so we can get away. She is still screaming at my students, getting in their faces and brandishing sharp pencils at their heads. Admin advises me to take the class back into the classroom. The student follows us back in still screaming. And no adult has even attempted to stop her. We are told to leave the room again, and this time they attempt to stop her. She is hurling the pencils, screaming curse words, and hitting the staff. She gets around the staff and I have to walk my class down to the library. She gets away from the staff and follows us there, at which point I have to literally RUN my class of 30 students to another classroom and lock the door behind us. The student chases us and is screaming and pounding on the door and the EBD staff still won’t touch her, never mind that she has threatened my students multiple times, assaulted at least two staff, and is now disrupting the learning of 60 plus students. They finally put her in a hold and take her back to the EBD room to calm down. We go back to my room which has been destroyed by her and help the admin in putting it back up right again. The EBD student returned to my classroom about 90 minutes later as if nothing happened with no consequence or parent contacts."

"  sister declined to donate their brother's organs due to feeling rushed and having a negative interaction with a coordinator.





","AITA for declining to donate my brother's organs over a comment?

I got a call from the police Friday night that my brother was in a motorcycle accident. He was speeding and crashed into a truck that was speeding.
I spoke with a doctor who said my brother showed no brain activity and was only kept alive because of a machine. Since he wasn't going to wake up, there was no sense in occupying a bed at a crowded hospital. So I authorized to turn off the machines.
I had to sign a bunch of paperwork. The first person that I met with was a ""donation coordinator."" My brother wasn't listed as an organ donor. Basically this coordinator wanted me to sign his organs away.
Don't get me wrong. His organs served no use to him anymore. He was 24 and healthy. I just had questions and wanted felt like I was being rushed.
I told the coordinator this and she said ""you can sign now and ask questions later."" That rubbed me the wrong way so I told her I wasn't signing donor authorization forms because of her attitude.
She left and I signed more docs. The last person to see me was the coordinator's boss who said that she heard there was a misunderstanding earlier and wanted to make sure I was okay and discuss the donor process.
I told her that I understood they just wanted my brother's organs and they couldn't care less about me. They're doing their job. But I'm not donating my brother's organs so they can be chopped up and played
with on a YouTube video. That was my concern.
That aside, I know I'm probably not the first person to have had a negative experience with this coordinator. I didn't need the attitude and that's why I'm not authorizing. 
I've been conflicted emotionally but logically I'm fine with it."
"  after finding an abundance of rubber weenies, a person spread joy by placing them in various locations across the country.




","I left 957 big black rubber weenies across the country

Back in 2008 I had just graduated college and was working at an import warehouse during the summer before my real job started in the fall. My job was to make sure the pallets of goods that came in were loaded onto the right trucks. Anyways, one day we got a delivery that was held up in customs since 2006. The company that ordered the shipment was no longer in business. We held onto the goods all summer but no one claimed them. Last day on the job I opened up the pallet and there were boxes and boxes of rubber weenies from China. In total 960 big black rubber weenies. Everyone on the floor was dying of laughter. Boss wanted them out of there and I thought I could make some money selling them on eBay so I offered to take them.  I loaded up my 1994 mustang with the rubber weenies and drove home. I put them in big black contractor bags and in the basement and started to post them for sale on eBay. Not sure if it was because of the financial crisis but the demand just wasn’t there. After months I only sold like 3 and made $30 after shipping.  I told a buddy I was going to throw them out and he suggested we place them on neighbors lawns instead. So after one night of drinking we walked through the neighborhood with a bag of weenies and put them on 12 or so lawns. I saw one guy's reaction the next day and it was awesome. So genuinely confused. I decided to hold onto the rubber weenies. I put a few in my trunk and anytime I saw a cool place to put one I would plop it down.  I live on the East Coast but traveled a ton for work. I would always bring a weenie with me. Right when Covid started I realized I was down to my last few. I thought it would be appropriate to leave them at hospitals. On April 3, 2020 I left my last weenie. I hope I brought joy to people's lives."
"  a distressing incident at eight years old, where a girl's father confronted a nurse who dismissed rectal bleeding as menstruation.","What is the worst thing a doctor has said to you?

When I was eight I woke up one morning, and promptly lost control of my bowls. When I took off my underwear it was covered in blood. I freaked out and told my father. About half an hour later it happened again.
We went to an emergency and ended up waiting for almost five hours. I kept bleeding. A nurse came in and listened to my father’s explanation, then shrugged and said: “She’s about the right age to start menstruating. It’s perfectly normal.”
To which my father replied: “Except you don’t menstruate out of your arse!”
Which is hysterical now, but I didn’t even know what menstruation was at the time. The nurse huffed and left, she returned with a tube of lubricant, and a really long cotton swab. She made my father leave the room, then shoved the cotton swab – lightly coated in the coldest lube ever – into my punani. While explaining to me about female puberty and menstrual cycles and how it was normal and my father was over-reacting.
It hurt a lot and when I told her and tried to get away she grabbed my ankle and held me in place and said: “It’s supposed to hurt.” The swab was clean – no blood. The nurse then returns later informing my father that I will have to stay overnight.
Then the jerk tried to insert a drip into my left hand, ‘tried’ being the key word. I have really bad veins for taking blood. So she sticks the needle into my hand and frowns and says: “Oh… It’s gone.” And then proceeds to wriggle the effing thing left and right to try and stab the vein she lost.
She repeated it again on my left inner-elbow and my right, all with the same results. She then gave up and went to get a proper doctor who had to deal with a hysterical eight year old. The Doctor got it on the first try.
I spent over a week in that hospital; they had me fasting the whole time. They tested me over and over and took so many blood tests that there was too much scar tissue on my arms so they had to start taking it from my legs. I remember begging them to stop.
Eventually the hospital gave up and transferred me to a children’s hospital.
The next day I was scheduled for a colonoscopy. Turned out I had upper gastrointestinal bleeding, they fixed it during the colonoscopy and I was released that night.
It wasn’t until I was much older I realized how close I was to dying of blood loss. This isn't the only time I've dealt with idiotic nurse/doctors/surgeons"
"  how pursuing a career in scientific research involves years of low pay, intense competition, limited job prospects, and ongoing stress.




","What glamorized career path is actually a complete nightmare?

Scientific research
First you bust your buttin undergrad to get accepted to a good grad school. If you're like me and did biology, that means you're going to be taking the same classes and stressing out about a lot of the same stuff as pre-meds. Then you go to grad school which lasts on average 5-8 years (in the sciences). That's most or all of your 20s spent making ~$26k/year on a student stipend. But hey, at least school is free.
Then after you graduate you've got your PhD and can go work, right? Not really. If you're extremely ""should play the lotto"" lucky, then yes, you'll get a coveted research job. If you're like the vast majority of people, however, you'll be forced to get a postdoc position. That's where you work under a professor in a lab (just like you always have) and get paid a whopping ~$40k/year. They also last for only 1-2 years, and once it's up it's time to try to get a real career job again, or, more likely, apply for yet another post-doc. People can be stuck postdocs for 10+ years.
This is the first real piece of the nightmare. Turns out twice as many PhDs graduate every year than there are jobs available for them in the sciences. That means there's a ton of competition all vying for the same tiny handful of professorships. ""What about industry?"" you say. Industry has even fewer openings and is a pipe-dream for most since they only want practical experience and skills. You're also still working under someone, unlike being a professor where you're free to explore any interest you want (kind of). So most people go for being a professor, where the average opening gets 200-300 extremely well qualified candidates.
But maybe you get lucky and get your job as an assistant professor (entry level). You're now making ~$60k/year, and you better bust your buttgetting tenure because if you don't meet your tenure requirements by the time you have your tenure hearing (after about 5-7 years at most places) you're fired. And the problem with that is, a typical part of tenure requirements is getting one to two R01 grants (the grant name is only relevant for biology, I have no clue what the physics/chemistry/etc. equivalents are). The R01 is a big grant, considered to be the bread and butter grant for research...too bad its funding rate is around 10%. Go to a scientific conference and chat with people and I guarantee you will have no problem at all finding scientists with stories of applying for that grant for years with no success.
Now let's say you miraculously make it past that hurdle and get bumped up to associate professor. Now you're making ~$75k/year and things are smoother sailing. Think you can stop worrying about grants? HA! Even if you work at a university that still has real tenure (i.e., can't be fired) they probably have a clause in there about you funding your own salary through grant money. So no grants = no salary. Even better, as you have your own lab, you're also the person funding your workers' salaries. So if you lose too much grant money, you have to fire everyone. This happens all of the time, even to great labs.
Finally, if you've had a successful career, then around the time you're in your 50s or 60s you'll get promoted to full professor, where you will finally make ~$100k/year.
It's worth noting that scientists' work lives are stressful. Working weekends and holidays is common. Working late is very common. You screw up one detail in an experiment and you may have just thrown away months of work. You are constantly stressing out if you'll reach the next goal or not. ""Will I get into grad school?"", ""will I finish grad school?"", ""will I ever get a professorship?"", ""will I ever get grant money?"", etc. You get exposed to dangerous stuff like radiation, biohazards, chemical hazards, carcinogens, hell, I've even been in rooms that had magnet hazard signs up.

"  falsely accused of assault, coping is hard. Ex-wife's false allegations fuel fear, making trust in intimate relationships difficult.




","[Serious] Men who have been falsely accused of assault, How did you cope with it?

Not very well, and it's still bugging me. 
This occurred 7 months after my wife and I separated.  When we separated, she was sent to her mother's house, which was on the opposite side of the country.  From there, she got kicked out by her mother, then her cousin, then her other cousin, etc.  Basically everyone in her family saw her true self.    Then she went off grid.
Right around the 7 month mark, neither my son or I had heard from her for months.  I was bobbing along at work (I've worked from home for over a decade) when I got a knock at the door, at 9am (time is important).  A deputy was at the door, and told me I was wanted for the assault of my wife the previous night.  I told him I had been home all evening, that this never occurred, and this was not the first time she made false allegations (tl;dr - ""You won't buy me more vodka at midnight? Then I'm going to call the cops on you"").   I asked where she had stated the assault occurred.
He gave me the name of a city that isn't in our state.  It's not in an adjoining state.  Driving, it takes 10 hours to get there.  It's an hour away from the nearest airport, so even if I flew, it would be at least 8 hours.  Then the kicker.  Her report came in at around midnight.  She was at a hotel, ""under the influence"", and at a hospital detox.  She claimed I was there, and hurt her.
I asked the deputy if he was serious, or if this was a gag. He was dead serious.  He didn't arrest me, but I had to go to their station and give a statement.  In my statement I pointed out that it would be a 20 hour round trip by car.  They let me go, never to hear from them again.
Now... fast forward to this year.  Roughly 13 additional months have passed.  Ex wife had been communicating with our son more, but hadn't visited or seen him for over 18 months.  She wanted to visit, he said yes but only in public. Perfect.  We met at an outdoor local mall. It really sucked. 45 minutes before my son asked to bail.  He got tired of her not caring about what he was saying, and interrupting to talk about her cats or her tattoo that gives her power.
She had some documents for me.  My son doesn't know, but she signed off custody.  When she went to the bathroom I looked through them quickly, and noticed an item titled ""victim safe harbor plan"".  
It was a document plan for her trip.  Drawn up by a domestic violence shelter in the state she was living in.  It listed me as the abuser, and her the victim.  It had everything from ""don't tell him what hotel you are in"", ""don't accept physical interaction"". and ""don't get into his car"".   I hid it before she got back. 
Ya'll... YA'LL.  She ASKED ME to DRIVE HER to HER HOTEL.  And mentioned that if I dropped our son off at home first, she could show me her NEW LINGERIE (she said that part in front of our son).  Of course I declined.  Our bedroom had been dead  before our .. 
Once we got home... It kinda hit me.  I read it again. My son caught me grumbling to myself, and asked to see it (I couldn't hide it, he had been reading over my shoulder, I was lost in thought).   He looked it over, looked at me, and said ""Dad, she was trying to get you arrested"". 
It shook me a bit, and still does to this day.  I won't know if it was her plan, but... if I had driven her to her hotel, she could have had someone watching.  And claim that she came back with bruises.  If I had taken her up on her other invitation?   All she would have to do was scream assault.  
She broke me physically during our marriage, mentally during and after, and now has left me with a fear of falling into a trap.  One word and a woman can destroy a man's life if the man isn't careful. And because of that, I don't know if I can ever trust a woman again on an intimate level.  Everyday interaction? Fine. But the thought of being on a date and making one false move, reading one signal wrong, any of that... ugh."

The first person to view my profile, before I had even put up a picture, was a good friend who said he was easily able to figure out it was me even without a photo. Ok, good sign that I'm representing myself well. 
The first couple of weeks I got the typical creeper messages and had started chatting with a few seemingly normal guys. Things got weird once I started going on dates.
First guy: Had no social skills. Looked like he had slept in the clothes he met me for breakfast in and hadn't showered. Said he was an amateur comedian but the jokes he tried to tell me came off as strange and not funny in the slightest. I had stupidly given him my cell number before we met and despite sending him a message on the site that I didn't see anything coming of that one date, he proceeded to text me at random intervals for two months asking to go to one of the open mic nights he was performing at.
Second guy: Seemed great when we were messaging. Was in a band, had a good job. He lived an hour from me so we agreed to meet at a great bar that was in between us. Stood me up and never responded to the message I sent the next day. He did send me a message about a month later as if we had never spoken before and I had the pleasure of reminding him of the situation and telling him to f off.
Third guy: Had a great first date and saw each other 3 more times that same week. Ended up hanging out for three months but only seeing each other every other week or so. Eventually he told me he wasn't attracted to me any more about the time I was realizing I wanted an actual relationship.
Fourth guy: This was the worst experience. We talked constantly for two weeks. He was ex-military, and looked really handsome in his pictures. When I pulled into the parking lot at the restaurant, I saw a guy walking and thought oh please don't let that be him. Surprise! It was him. His pictures were obviously several years old. He had gained at least 50 lbs, his hairline was receding and he was not as handsome as his pictures looked. I'm not shallow so I figured if conversation went as well as online we'd still have fun. Wrong, all he talked about during dinner was his time in the military and barely let me get a word in. He also decided to tell me how he had been engaged until a few months ago, but she had left him. Great topic for a first date. We then went to a movie and I honestly remember next to nothing about it because I was focusing on keeping his hand off my leg. He kept trying to rub my leg and arm and just generally being creepy. By the time we left the movie he was talking like we were already in a relationship. I was ready to get the hell away from this guy and of course he goes for a kiss which I successfully deflected. Sent him a message the next day saying there was no chance for any sort of relationship and luckily never heard from him again.
Fifth guy: I get a message saying ""I don't know how much we really have in common but..."" Talk constantly for a week. Decided to meet for dinner and a movie. He was late because of traffic. Luckily it was much cuter than his pictures. Had a wonderful dinner, great conversation, really hitting it off. I Went to the theater and the movie we had planned to see was not playing at that time anymore. I had looked at the wrong day on the website. Ok, choose a different movie that isn't 45 minutes long. Go to the mall across the street, walk around and talk some more. Get back to the theater and that showing is sold out. I Bought tickets for the next showing in a half hour. It was the opening weekend of the movie so it was on two screens. Sit in the theater for half an hour talking. Kiss then spent the whole movie with his arm around me. Sit in my car for half an hour after the movie talking some more. 
And that is how several bad experiences lead up to the most ill planned date ever with the man that I have been with for over a year now and will, eventually, marry."
"  after someone meets their online friend, things took a dark turn as the person became possessive, obsessive, and creepy.","People who have met their online friends, what made you instantly regret it?

He got freakishly obsessive and possessive.
Met online through a fandom, after a few years the fandom pretty much fell apart but a handful of us stayed friends because we actually had a fair amount in common. D was very normal, the rest of the group seemed to love him, about 4 years after just being online mates we met in person, it went fine. We interacted a lot on (FB and Instagram) I hit a really busy period in my life but managed to squeeze in a Christmas get-together at my place for my little group of friends including D. After that my online activity decreased drastically due to being busy and when I managed to get on FB I noticed that most of the group were no longer friends with D, weird but whatever. I checked my messenger and saw message after message after message asking why I wasn't responding, what was I doing, could we arrange a meet up etc, I explained I was super busy and it was also coming up to the anniversary of my mum's death so just give me some time and we'll see about meeting up another time. He said ""oh yeah I forgot about the anniversary, you can have that day but I expect a response after"" eff that, I blocked him, so he sent email after email after email asking me ""what is your effing problem, what the eff do you think you're doing"" etc so I blocked his email too.
After 3 very peaceful weeks there was a knock on my door, it was D and he had a six page letter detailing why we had to be friends. I shut the door, used an anonymous email to tell him if he contacted me again/showed up at my door I would call the police. Went on FB and told everyone (including the two remaining mutual friends) about it all and could the mutuals not share anything about me/my life and actively discourage him from attempting to make contact.
The friends who had long since unfriended him started messaging me that they stopped talking to him because of how creepy he was being in PM's about me always asking if they knew what I was doing, had I talked to them, was I seeing anyone, was I actually busy because he was convinced wasn't etc. In return I told them how he'd been trying to convince me to stop being friends with them because according to him they were all sorts of horrible things and that they were incredibly jealous and hated how close he and I were, I assumed he was just butthurt because they stopped talking to him so was just making up a bunch of crap about these people who had always been perfectly nice to me.
One incredibly weird occurrence just before this all happened was me telling a mutual friend on FB that I was heading to the aquarium in London with my daughter (mutual friend was also in London that day with their daughter) and maybe we could grab a coffee/let the kids play in the park for a bit. I checked my messages later that evening and D was incredibly upset because he'd waited at Farringdon station exit for 2 hours so he could come to the aquarium too and I didn't show up (we did not get off at that station, but one that was two stops after and closer to where we were going).
I haven't heard a peep in over a year, he has apparently deleted his FB and Instagram and thankfully just disappeared."
  a funeral of a criminal a person shot. Unexpected understanding and forgiveness from the deceased's parents brought surreal emotions.,"People who attended the funeral of a criminal, what was it like?

People who've attended the funeral of somebody who died in criminal/very frowned upon circumstances (i.e. shot while robbing a store), what was it like?
I attended the funeral of someone that I shot. More on what happened here.
In short, I conceal carry a pistol, a guy comes into the store robbing it. I didn't act because he seemed content with getting his money and was leaving, and I had no clear shot when he first entered. I won't risk innocent bystanders with my own rounds. When he was leaving he turned the gun to a teen girl, and I feared he would shoot her. I pulled my gun and shot him.
I was cleared in the shooting and ended up visiting his parents not long after. When I did, they didn't blame me, but said that their son had left me no choice, and that he had lost track in his life years earlier, and that they had more or less been expecting that day to come.
They said that for as much as they need to say goodbye, maybe I needed closure as well with what had happened. I didn't want to kill someone. If I could have stopped him without killing him, I would have, but in the timeframe and options I had, I was limited.
I said I wouldn't come, because it didn't feel right, and people might find it inappropriate. His mother said ""Oh honey, nobody but us will be there. Michael wasn't accepted by our family or our friends."" I realized he had probably been on a bad path his entire life.
In the end I did go, and I didn't really know why at first. I kept my distance and didn't want to get involved. It was very strange as a whole. At the end of the ceremony his parents placed flowers on his casket and asked if I wanted to come forward. I didn't even know that they had noticed me arriving because I had stayed at the back of the church.
I'm not an emotional person, but I started crying. It was just so surreal. I killed their son, and they invited me to pay my respects. The priest told me it's perfectly fine if I don't want to, and that he and our lord welcomed anyone to pay their respects, no matter their involvement.
I didn't approach the casket, and they came to me and asked me if I wanted to say anything. All I could think of was ""I tried"". His mother gave me a look of ""We all did"" and walked out. His father put his hand on my shoulder, opened his mouth but didn't say anything either, then left.
I send flowers to his grave every year now. I've made it part of my life to try to help troubled people out of their bad lives, as I was one of them at one point as well. I related to the whole situation, because if not for a lucky break when I was 17, it could well have been me holding up that store.

"  hormonal cries over trivial things. From cheese shortage to dress choices, their emotional rollercoaster leaves them and others bewildered.","Ladies of reddit, what's the silliest thing you've cried over while feeling hormonal?

My sisters and mother have cried over :
-having no ‘good’ cheese for mac and cheese (my mother)
-having mismatched undies and bras for one day (the oldest)
accidentally hurting our dogs in any way during a certain period of the month will send all five of my sisters into the ugliest gaggle of crying banshees I’ve ever witnessed. I just rub the poor confused dog and them hand them over to the incessant cuddles and pets from the crying girls
her boyfriend forgot their 3-month anniversary ... and she expected a fancy dinner event decked to the nines (she was in middle school at the time too)
the Sephora closed down due to electric repairs and they couldn’t get concealer the week before a quince
I somehow ‘knew’ through magical telepathy that all 5 were in sync and I subsequently forgot to get all of them ‘care baskets’ one month of the year when I had an unexpected car repair (I’ve only done this for my mother, pre-hysterectomy, because she had terrible cramps)
they constantly tear up at seeing our family dogs acting cute; one particular instance sent one of them into a raging ugly cry of one hour as she realized that her mascara and her wings were now smeared
One of them actually cried at me because she believed I blamed them for my s xuality - as if being raised with 5 girls affected my s xuality - and then had another meltdown lasting 3 hours when she realized how ridiculous she sounded. I was covered in tears, snot and mascara by the end of that drunk fiasco.
i’ve known them their entire goddamn life and I still can’t understand what possessed them when One Direction was a thing and they played the same damn song for THREE YEARS and why they would cry if I changed it
alternatively, I don’t understand how my dad isn’t canonized yet as a saint by the church; there’s at least one day a month where they have a full blown hormonal meltdown where they can’t decide which dress to wear for Sunday dinners and they make my dad do it. Then they proceed to cry even more because his choice is done to make them purposefully look like a sack of potatoes; I rage quit ages ago
my mother will cry to the end of Titanic; it’s either a single tear or full blown sobbing ugly cry. It’s all depending on ‘how much wine she’s had’ - they have no wine in the house
one of them totally sobbed and cried in the theaters when we went to see Les Mis, but since they all came out teary eyed, I have no clue which one it was
There’s more. I can’t possibly list all the times my sisters have made me tear my hair out with their mood swings, hormones, and their general ‘i’m crying because i was compelled to’ moments."
"  customers made threats in Spanish about assaulting and killing a coworker, unaware the coworker understood. No harm ensued.




","What is the worst thing you have heard uttered from another human being?

Some customers were talking in Spanish about how easy it would be to assault and kill one of my tiny 4’8” coworkers that was checking them out at the register.
Even worse, they were discussing their guesses on how much fight she would have if they were to drag her into the forest behind the shopping mall RIGHT IN FRONT HER as she was smiling and ringing up their total.
“Se miró un guerito, pero entiendo a todos.”
“You see a small white dude, but I understand everything.”
They instantly stopped talking and looked me dead in the eyes. Couldn’t tell if they were surprised I knew Spanish, challenging them to their “bluff” or a combination of both. It got dead quiet at this point and my coworker dropped her smile as she noticed something was wrong.
They left the store all without breaking eye contact with me. 
Ended up staying for the rest of the night shift with her just in case they tried to do something stupid."
"  undervalued employee's remarkable achievements go unrecognized, leading them to leave the company, leaving their boss in panic.




","""Just keep your head down."" You got it, boss.

I've been working for a couple years for some Fortune 500 company in the US. I was hired to do a job with creating training using a specific (and rather niche) digital adoption software that for some inexplicable reason took my two predecessors 40 hours a week or more to do. I had never even heard of it before getting hired, but it seemed like easy enough software.
After a couple months, I could basically get everything handled for the week within about 3 hours - provided there weren't any emergencies. I started branching out into other technologies and responsibilities, because my boss was fine with whatever I wanted to focus on, provided I ensured my main priority of upkeep on the software was done first. I found lots of ways to help out my coworkers and even invented a software program that really helped them automate some very tedious tasks.
Fast forward a couple years, and I've really done well with this random niche software. Been awarded highest honors at the time from the software company. Had case studies done about my work. Actually single handedly saved my company $20 million in production loss alone, according to the case studies.
I say all that only to highlight how dumbfounded I was when my boss, who I like as a person, but has never once given me a metric in my entire time here, said at my annual review that I did not ""exceed expectations"" and that I merely ""met expectations"" therefore I was only entitled to a 2% raise that year.
Um...what? Can't you just give me a tiny portion of that $20 million I saved the company instead of just giving that all to senior leadership's bonuses again? Also, even if I don't have metrics, I would think that if I ever did, saving $20 million, getting an award, and having a case study of my work all in one year just might put me even slightly above those ""expectations"".
Here's the second thing that pissed me off. Remember all those extra duties I took on? Well my boss wanted to make those official. I said, ""Great! Let's figure out a job title and salary that will incorporate those extra responsibilities."" Initially, my boss was on board for that and asked me back in September to collect similar job postings for the role I was looking to move up to (interaction / UX designer).
I gave my boss what they asked for, and then waited. I followed up on it every time we had a 1 on 1 meeting and my boss told me they were getting to it soon.
...for 4 months.
I finally came right out and asked my boss what the issue was because they weren't giving me any real direction on how to get to next steps for this role.
My boss then informed me:
It's ""tough times"" for the company (despite me literally editing a video from the CEO bragging about how revenue had never been higher literally the week before).
Boss hadn't even looked at the job qualifications I sent them.
Boss never even checked to make sure we could make this position happen in the first place, which in my mind should have been their very first thing to do before saying we could go for it.
My newly created metric would include these extra duties (to which I promptly gave a great, big, vocal HELL NO to and made them back down and remove them).
I asked my boss about next steps for this now unobtainable position if this is what the reality was. Then I was hit with this line:
""Just keep your head down this year, and maybe next year we can revisit this conversation.""
Keep...my head...down?
....
....
....Well, okay then. Cue/Que/Queue/Kyew the MC.
I did keep my head down...into job boards, I put my head down into job interviews, when opportunities to volunteer my time at work to help with extra things, instead of offering up my help, you best believe I kept my head down.
Remember how I worked on this niche software? Turns out, it's so niche and hard to find experienced people that finding another (better) job wasn't hard at all.
Put in my two weeks notice last week. Boss was dumbfounded. They are now panicking and asking me to do crash course knowledge transfer to others, as if I didn't already request this very thing multiple times to no avail for months.
I think I'll just keep my head down instead for the remainder of my time. Boss's orders."
"  drunk friends save severely beaten girl, steal car, and rush her to the hospital in an act of chaotic goodness.




","Reddit, what’s the most “Chaotic Good” thing you’ve ever seen?

Did my 1 year mandatory service.
Had the weekend off, so me and some friends went to the club and got smashed... nobody got any hits (no wonders).
On our way back about 2 blocks from the club one of us heard a whimpering from an alley, we checked out.
There was this girl beaten to a pump. I mean her face was a mess, missing teeth, no eyes to be seen.
The medic (cough) amongst us assessed her as good as you can when wasted. She could feel her limbs, stand and all that.
I went RUNNING back to the club to call 911, it was before cell phones...
Nope, we had to wait at least an hour, there was no ambulance available.
I booked back, and said just that.
There were 4 of us. Me, medic, gangster (tall, slender but totally crazy), and big Mike (bodybuilder).
I told them what I was told.
Gangster said, get her together, I'll get a ride!
Medic and Mike get her up and I almost puked from the running and booze.
30 seconds later a car screeches around the corner...
It's a gangster in a nice car.
GET IN! WERE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL!
We get her to the car, she gets in, sobbing and all.
Then Mike figures out that we can't drive 15km as effed up as we are...
Right, what now?
Mike jumps out when he sees a dude.
CAN YOU DRIVE?
The dude meekly says yeah...
Good, says Mike, you're driving us to the hospital, she's beat up dude!
So if he goes, we jump in and off we go.
We deliver her to the ER, make sure that she is taken care of and then we run, we're intoxicated as eff and don't want to talk to the cops.
Driver drives us back where he got us from and gets out, so do we.
Then the gangster said that we should leave too, the car was sort of stolen...
So that is how my friends and I stole a car, kidnapped a driver and got a girl to hospital.
... and I had the worst hangover ever the day after .
Good? Maybe
Chaotic? Absolutely."
"  pregnant cousin's girlfriend smokes, drinks, and ignores warnings, while criticizing person for eating deli meat, highlighting double standards.","What is the most infuriating case of double standards or hypocrisy you've come across?

My personal experience?....
I was about 8 months pregnant. My cousin's girlfriend was about 7 months pregnant. We were all at my aunt's house. My cousin's gf, let's call her Kristy.... Had a reputation of being not very bright, but also very arrogant. She insisted that it was perfectly fine to SMOKE during her pregnancy, because the ""baby's lungs were not developed yet"". WOW. Just.... Wow. No matter what evidence my aunt showed Kristy, she stuck with her stubborn, selfish, belief. She smoked cigarettes up until 6 months pregnant, and smoked pot from a street substance dealer up until the car ride to the hospital to deliver. She also drank 2 alcoholic beverages a day (we all suspected possibly more). We were all appalled, but there was nothing we could do to stop her. I had not said one thing to her about it, because it just wasn't my place to... My aunt had said enough.
On the other hand... I completely gave up alcohol (I never smoked), all coffee, caffeine, getting my hair and nails done, sushi, and everything that my midwife said could possibly cause harm to the unborn baby. I even switched to a ""natural"" deodorant.
Back to my aunt's house... My aunt had come back from a store, with sub hoagies, fresh deli meats, and cheese. We all started making ourselves subs, except for Kristy... Who was busy smoking a blunt in the bedroom. As I was eating my turkey sandwich, Kristy comes out from the bedroom, high as a kite, looks at me dead seriously, and says, ""You're not supposed to be eating that. Deli meat is unsafe for the baby"".
It took every ounce of energy in my body to not hurl myself screaming in her face."
"  qualified tattooless chef dismissed due to age. Incompetent, arrogant replacement serves disastrous dishes. Chaos follows, and original applicant rejects job offer.","Hiring managers of Reddit- what was your most 'wtf is wrong with this person' moment you've had during an interview?

We were looking for a sous chef that would be able to work and train for a few months and then eventually fill my shoes as CDC, as I was leaving in about six months time. We were a big, very successful restaurant in a super competitive city, and had a ton of applications and interviews. Most interviews for a chef position include a pretty informal chat with a hiring chef, the owner and the general manager and a cooking/ tasting portion, where the interviewee plans a menu of five or six dishes and serves them to the interviewers.
One guy came in and ended the interview, and served incredible dish after incredible dish, but the owner didn't like him because the guy interviewing was tattooless and 50+ years old, and he felt that this guy's age wasn't conducive to our hip, late night vibe. Whatever, you do you Jeff, you insufferable prick.
The owner calls me a few days later and tells me that he found a guy that he wanted to poach from a small bistro just outside of town. This guy comes in and is super cool: fresh jacket, oozing confidence and a ton of cooking tattoos- the owner is in love and I'm hoping that this guy is into overweight guys with chef jackets that are 2 sizes too small. Before the interview all candidates had to send over an ingredient list so that we could order any ingredients that they may need for the cooking portion of the interview, and this guy had requested some foie gras for a dish he said had been awarded time and again- a fois and lobster crepe. Didn't sound very good to me, but I was willing to give it a shot and see how it went.
After the meeting, the guy went into our kitchen and started cooking. After about ten minutes we all hear the guy screaming at one of our prep cooks to slice him some chives. A few minutes after that he brings out the app, which he says is his take on shrimp and grits, something that is already on our menu, and that he says is better than ours. I point out a few things: the shrimp is overcooked, the grits are gluey, and that the chives he was so stressed out about weren't even on the plate. He tells me that the problem was that our prep cook didn't speak English and that when he was chef, he would make sure the entire BOH staff was fluent. Holy shit- warning bell #1.
After two more dismal dishes, he tells us that he is going to make his famous crepes- I am effing pumped because I know that it is going to be an absolute shit show. The dude is in the kitchen for at least 45 minutes, screaming, cursing and throwing shit around. I go back into the kitchen to see what the guy is doing, and he is fiddling with the Vitamix, which looks like it's full of caulk. I ask him what's going on and he tells me that he's just blending the crepe batter. I point out that crepe batter usually doesn't have the consistency of modeling clay, and he pretty much tells me to eff off, and that this dish has won awards. I look over at his phone which is out on the table and see that there is a recipe from allrecipes.com for crepes pulled up on it. So, not only does this guy not know how to make his ""signature dish"", but he can't even follow a simple effing recipe.
He brings his dish out, and it's a effing mess. Burned fois, rubbery lobster, broken bearnaise etc... The concept sucked, but the execution was somehow even worse. The crepe itself, though, was a culinary abortion. It was as if someone had given a lump of gray play-dough a pap smear. I straight up told him that it was one of the worst things I'd seen produced in a kitchen, and he pushed back saying that it would have been great if my staff had given him the support he needed.
Despite my protests, we hired him. The owner thought that he was cool and projected the kind of image we needed. He lasted about a month before I threw his butt out of my kitchen- which the owner never forgave me for. I called the old guy that killed the interview and offered him the job and he essentially told me to get bent, because he knew he deserved the job in the first place, and he was right."
"  a demanding woman claims connection to owner for last-minute reservation at fully booked restaurant, but leaves disappointed.




","What’s a phrase that shitty people use?

Years back, my friend worked at a restaurant.
He worked in the back most of the time but would fill in
out front to cover vacations/callouts, etc.
So, one Saturday, around 10 am, this woman comes in
and says ""I want to book your party room."" Now, they
had a party room upstairs from the restaurant that was
pretty in demand as it was a nice space, the food was
good and it was reasonably priced. Weekend dates
were usually booked 2-3 months in advance.
So, anyway, my friend pulls out their reservation book
and says, ""What date do you want? I'll see if we have
an opening."" She looks at him, in total seriousness, and
says, ""Tomorrow. A bridal shower for 40 people."" Now, he
already knew they were booked because he was doing
the cooking for that event.
He says, ""Ma'am. I'm sorry. We're already booked for
tomorrow - this room usually books out about 2-3
months. I won't be able to accommodate you since we
already have another event.""
She says, ""Well, then you can have them rebook their
event. I already sent out invitations and I have 40
people showing up here tomorrow. What are YOU going
to do?""
He said, 'Ma'am, I'm very sorry. I don't know what to tell
you. We don't 'rebook' scheduled events. There are a
couple of other nearby restaurants you can try to see
if they can accommodate your group. We definitely
cannot.""
Then she looks at him and says, ""Don't you know who I
am? I'm a close, personal friend of Peter (the owner).
You NEED to make this right. Tell Peter to close the
restaurant and our event can be downstairs while the
Another event is upstairs. He's done this for me before.
Just write it down in your little book. It'll be fine.""
Now, my friend worked at this restaurant for 10 years
, and not once had Peter EVER closed down the 
restaurant for a private event. It was private events
upstairs, and a restaurant downstairs. Further, he had not
once ever seen this woman in his life, and Peter was
not known for his largesse, so he decided to call her on
her bluff...
He says, ""Well, I can't make that call, but Peter certainly
can. I'll go get him so we can sort this out."" The woman
kind of got a blank look on her face but didn't say
anything.
Now, Peter was not a man who liked dealing with
this sort of thing, which is why he had the front of house
staff. He especially disliked it when he was doing his
inventory and order which is what he was doing at
that moment.
So, friend Peter, explains the situation. He comes
out, looks at the woman, and goes ""Who the hell
are you?"" She gives him some spiel and he just shuts
her down totally and goes ""We're booked tomorrow""
and returns to the back. She starts to CRY, begging my
friend to help her in some way as she has 40 people
coming to a restaurant where she has no booking.
He just said ""Sorry, I can only suggest these other
restaurants"" and, with that, the woman left.
Who the hell sends out invitations BEFORE booking a
venue? Idiot.
The only good thing was no one from the party showed up
the next day, just the people from the scheduled event.
So, she must have figured out something…"
"  during a Thanksgiving gathering, a family's tensions explode when the mother publicly accuses the father of cheating and insults relatives.","What was that incident during Thanksgiving?

I believe the year was 2014? I had just graduated high school and my family was crumbling. My parents were not doing well in their marriage and my mom had me drive separately so that we would have a second car to leave early with if we needed it. (Red Flag #1) Mom did NOT want to go, but she felt that she should be there since all of her kids were going.
Thanksgiving was not a small gathering. I'm talking about 90-130 people that rented out space in a church banquet hall to have this gathering. It was a typical West Virginia gathering. Everyone was drinking and talking about church (I don't mind this, I'm just not religious myself) and Grandma was about to turn 90 the day after Thanksgiving, so everyone was all over her and she LOVES attention.
Mom and Dad started to argue quietly in the corner about how (JustNo) Grandma was just interjecting herself into everything and you could just see the tension building between my parents. They were constantly making passive-aggressive comments to each other and to the family members. It was all the drama in the room.
My grandma kept asking me if the kids were okay (no, but we're going to admit that). I told her that we were fine, but she then decided that we needed to extend our stay so that we could go to church on Sunday with her because we obviously needed Jesus. (My family has always been Atheist). She said we were raised poorly and badly behaved because we didn't have church in our lives. (All of my siblings are between the ages of 14-18, all have good grades and were polite..etc). I told my mom what she said to me and she blew a freaking lid. (Red Flag #2)
She went to dad and told him to tell off Grandma, and he refused and said that she was just trying to help and she thinks Jesus is the answer.
She said, and I quote, ""THE ONLY PERSON WHO NEEDS JESUS IN THIS ROOM IS YOU, YOU LYING, CHEATING SOB.""
Dead effing silent. The whole room just stopped talking and moving, and that's effing terrifying when there's that many freaking people.
Dad then blew up on mom in front of everyone because she was embarrassing him. Grandma had to sit because she was so stunned. Mom decided to announce to everyone that dad was cheating on her and she was gathering evidence for the divorce. She then decided to point at every single person she hated in the room and describe to them why she hated them. Some examples -
""Uncle Mike touches kids, and everyone knows it, but nobody does anything about it."" (He was known to be a little too friendly with the kids).

She turned to Grandma and said ""You're the most bitter old beach of this entire bunch. I can only hope your pathetic ass doesn't make it to 90."" (Her 90th birthday was literally the next day)

"  a childhood mystery: Sneaking to play video games, mom sensed a ghost. Years later, she learned it was her sneaky child.","What’s your childhood mystery that you finally solved years later?

I solved a family mystery for my mom. I wasn’t allowed to play console video games during the week all the way until I was 18 but some nights I’d really been craving it so I would noiselessly creep through my house into my basement where I could play video games in peace. But once every 30 times or so one of my parents would need something from the basement and I’d quickly turn off the tv monitor, hide in the guest room and pray they didn’t turn on a light or notice the Xbox was on. One night I ducked into the guest room and hid behind the bed. To my horror my mom followed me into the room and turned on the lights. I was panicking so when she started digging through the closet with her back to me I made a run for it. I nearly brushed her shirt and if she’d seen me I’d probably have given her a heart attack. But I made it and kept going all the way to bed.
About 5 years went by and my mom said something like “you’re such a quiet walker” and I told her it was because of my basement trips thinking I had nothing to lose. My mom’s face went kinda solemn and when I explained she said “so there really was someone down there.” And she explained that she remembered that exact night and the feeling that there was a ghost in the room. Over the next couple days she’d stare into space and just say “I can’t believe you were really there.” She seemed to get over it but she probably checks empty rooms closer now."

8 years old, my side hurts like all hell. Burning, stabbing, excruciating pain, unlike any I've felt in my life. My parents believe me - I've never acted like this in my life.
Doctor A: 15 minutes touching my right side as I wince and cry in pain. ""I find nothing wrong with this boy.""
Thankfully my parents believe me more than the pediatrician I've had for years.
Doctor B: ""Give him some ibuprofen and call back in 24 hours.""
Doctor C: ""Probably just kidney stones, he'll pass them eventually, reduce calcium in his diet.""

A few X-rays and CT scans later, turns out I was septic, minutes from going into shock. I had a rare developmental syndrome where some of my organs were growing faster than the rest of my body. As a result of this, a hole developed where the ureter meets the kidney caused by torsion of the organ contorting to try and fit inside my body as it grew.

"  Hells Angels bikers pay respectful tribute at the funeral of a wild and beloved uncle, leaving a profound lesson on camaraderie.




"," What's the nicest thing you've seen a gang do? 

The Hell's Angels came to my uncle's funeral. My mom had four older brothers. One I've only met once, because he lives in Florida and that's halfway across the country. Growing up, the other three all lived in my hometown, and I saw two of them pretty regularly. The other uncle - Dewey - only came around when he really needed something.
Dewey was a good ol' boy born into a family of staunch whitebread catholics. Dewey was completely bald, with a mustache/goatee combo that would make Jamie Hyneman jealous, and mirrored sunglasses that never left his face. Dewey liked his smoking and his drinking and his effing and his motorcycle. Dewey and my grandfather - a WWII vet who drove himself to the hospital when he was having a heart attack because ""ambulances are too expensive and will wake up the neighbors"" - never got along. Dewey was a wild child: married by 21, kid by 23, divorced by 25.
He soon joined up with a local band of bikers and rode around the city (according to my mom; I was still young) looking for a good time. I distinctly remember him coming to Christmas and Thanksgiving parties, having a couple beers, and leaving because ""He had drinking to do."" He never stuck around for food or festivities or church - just had a couple cold ones, shot the crap with his sister for a bit, and rolled off into the night.
I remember when he was diagnosed with cirrhosis. He spent just a few weeks in the hospital and I went and saw him one last time with my family. He still looked jovial - he was never a bad guy, always called me ""little dude"", and had a dirty joke to tell - and while my family beat around the bush when it came to his impending death, he gave me the best deathbed wish I've ever heard. ""I don't want anyone to grieve for me after I've gone,"" he said. ""I've lived my life as full as I could. I had a damn good time every day of my life and I regret nothing. Don't be sad that I've died, I want you all to effing party for me.""
We had a typical funeral - ironic, I know - but during the wake we heard a tremendous commotion outside, like hundreds of bees landing in the parking lot. The door swung open, and in walked two or three dozen hardcore bikers - bandanas, Hells Angels vests, sunglasses, skulls on everything, dirty leather chaps, long greasy hair, smell of motor oil and whiskey. My conservative family fell silent and watched as these tough mothereffers walked up to his casket. One at a time, they paid their respects. Some prayed. Some cried. Some talked to him, promising to ride again with him in the great beyond. Some stood quietly in reverie.
They were devoted to their fallen brother, and so incredibly respectful to my grandparents you would have thought my grandfather was their drill instructor. They thanked him, told my grandmother they were sorry for her loss, and left as suddenly as they'd come, leaving only the vague scent of Jack on the air and a heavy, unspoken lesson about camaraderie in our hearts"
"  a person mistakenly believed their car was stolen, only to realize later they had walked home from the supermarket.




","What did you do that made you question your own intelligence?

I got up in the morning to go to civil service (had to, it was either that or real military) when I noticed my car wasn't at its usual parking spot. I got confused so I searched for it around where I live, but couldn't find it. Then I called the parking service if they towed my car away for illegal parking (it was a private parking space, that day turned out to be a very long one), and they basically said they don't take cars away from people's yards, so I figured my car was stolen. It was a real punch in the gut.
Anyway, I reported I would be late for ""work"" and called the police. They told me to come over to the station, where a detective would talk to me, so I did. We met and he told me to wait in the hallway until he is done with another case. That gave me time to think, and it went something like this:
""So my car was stolen. But who would steal a 1989 Ford Escort?""
""Probably some junkie, to sell it for some grass or something.""
""My dad works with addicts, I wonder if he knows the guy.""
""I wonder what dad will say. Yesterday, we watched football together and I gave him a lift home, no more free rides I guess.""
""Hmm I drove my dad home yesterday. What else did I do?""
""Ah, right, I stopped at the gas station on my way back.""
""Then I went to buy ice cream. I parked the car at the supermarket.""
""I ate the ice cream on my way home, it was good.""
""Wait, how did I drive and eat ice cream? Ah, right, I went home on foot from the supermarket.""
""Wait, what?""
""OH MY GOD I WENT HOME ON FOOT, MY CAR IS AT THE SUPERMARKET""
""ABORT ABORT ABORT""
""OOH GOD I AM GOING TO PRISON FOR LYING TO THE POLICE""
""NO WAIT I GOT THIS. Ah, some friends of mine, you see, they took my keys and, damn those pranksters, they, you see, ice cream...""
At this point, the detective comes back and says we can talk now, and I start rumbling about a practical joke involving my car and my friends. When he said ""Sure, we will find the car and dust for fingerprints, they can't do this.""
It was here where I did the first reasonable thing that day: I told the truth.
""Ah, you see, I went out to buy ice cream yesterday...""
The detective first looks at my pathetic, terrified face, and then bursts into what was probably the best laughter that man has ever had. So here we are, standing in the middle of the police station, and a detective is laughing so hard at me, he can't breathe or stand tall, he's bent over and crying tears of pure joy. The other police officers are looking at us and at each other, then back at us.
""Can I go home?"", I asked. He didn't reply, he couldn't talk, so he just waved at me, and then at the door. So I went to get my car. It was there, safe and sound, just as I left it.
At the civil service, they laughed at me for the whole day. One woman, in particular, had a hard time doing anything productive that day.
What kinda surprised me the most was when, later that day, I went to the same supermarket, and a random police officer saw me on the street and started laughing at me. For a while, I was a celebrity with the local police force.
But it's ok, the guy that laughed the most at me that day was me."
"  in the 80s, a monkey beats up a dog after the dog's owner refuses to control it, leaving onlookers astonished.","What is the most surprising thing you have ever seen go down in public?

I was waiting out front of a truck stop back in the mid 80's. Sitting on a park bench with a guy that had a big Rottweiler kinda dog on a leash with him. I tried to make small talk but he was quite a sourpuss. So we sat in silence for a few minutes until the most unexpected thing I have ever seen, happened right before my very eyes.
While we were sitting there a big 18 wheeler pulls in without a trailer (bobtail) so he parks right up front like a normal car would. Inside the cab of the truck with the driver is a little monkey. Well the dog spots this lil monkey and proceeds to go apeshit over it. Lunging at the end of his leash and barking at the top of his lungs. Generally making a real spectacle of himself to say the least.
The driver is obviously upset, but not nearly as much as the monkey is. Actually upset may be the wrong adjective to use for the monkey though. He was pacing the dashboard back and forth. Never taking his eyes off of this very aggravating dog.
The driver opens his little triangle window that they don't make on cars anymore. The ones made for smokers back in the day. He yells out to this douche bag to call his dog off because it is upsetting his monkey. The guy laughs and says no way. Says that his dog ain't bothering nobody. The dog hasn't shut up since he laid eyes on the monkey. I promise you he is bothering everybody for several blocks around.
Now here's where things start to get interesting. The driver says that if he doesn't call his dog off he's gonna let his monkey loose on that dog. Douche bag laughs and says that his dog would eat that monkey alive. Upon hearing this the driver leans over and reaches into his glove box I guess. Pulls out one of those tiny baseball bats like you used to get at Astroworld or carnivals, and places it in the monkeys hand.
The monkey obviously knows what's about to go down because he is now trying to squeeze out of that little triangular window I mentioned earlier. This monkey has murder in his eyes if I have ever seen it. Driver hollers ""Last chance to save your dog's ass man."" In response douche bag lets his dog off of the leash. Now we have a situation that has escalated to the point where we have a dog jumping up at the window and a monkey screaming profanities right back at him. Well, the driver finally rolls down the regular window and out leaps all kinds of miniature primate hell. The dog never knew what hit him. Quick as a flash this monkey is riding on the back of this dog's neck. His two back feet all wrapped up in his neck fur with one hand hanging onto an ear. The other hand as you may have guessed by now is steadily and mercilessly raining down blows about this dog's head and face. I mean hard blows. You can hear them whap whap whap.
Well it only took a moment for the dog to realize he was in way over his head. He bolts yelping bloody murder as he runs away at full speed. I mean this dog is running so fuckin hard he's throwing up tufts of grass and dirt as soon as he leaves pavement. The monkey still riding him and beating on him the whole time. Douche bag acts like he wants to fight now but several people including myself stepped in to stop that nonsense. In a couple of minutes or so the little monkey comes loping back with his little bat still in hand, and leaps up into the still open window of the truck to await his master who has gone on into the store.
That wanker ran off to try to go find his dog, but I don't know if he ever did. My ride showed up and I had to go. Never again in this lifetime will I see something so totally crazy and unexpected like that."

Also asked me a bunch of questions about my health. I never planned on sleeping with him I just didn't want him to find me weird.
Anyway we met at a hotel, I told him I didn't want to bang I just wanted to be held and given words of affirmation and care. He agreed and I paid him. I gave him flashcards.

"  subjected to escalating abuse, husband left his ex-wife, but faced property damage, stolen belongings, and relentless harassment thereafter.","Guys who have rejected someone, what's the worst way someone has taken it?

My ex wife started acting real shady. Sneaking out of the house to make phone calls, hiding incoming calls and not telling who was calling in the middle of date night even though I asked nicely. She was also a mean drunk and had started drinking to excess every night. Then the physical violence started. Throwing shit at my head, including a large rock. Kicking and punching when she got angry. This is where I drew the line. One night she went off the rails again in front of her small children and I just knew that I could no longer live like that. I had just returned home from a week long business trip and hadn’t unpacked my bags yet, so I grabbed those, took one last look at my nice home and my family and left. As I walked out I knew full well that all of the things I didn’t grab were probably gone for good. But I needed to be as well, or I would either end up in jail or dead.
She blew my phone up for the next couple of weeks. At least 60 text messages a day on the work cell. All hate filled and incredibly vile. I tried to call her a couple of times when off of work to talk about how we could best separate our finances and things and try to move on amicably, but she would just scream and accuse me of cheating because that was the only logical reason why I had left. Cheaters all do this btw. The last time we talked before the divorce she threatened to file a false police report for harming her 4 year old son. She didn’t specify whether the allegation would be physical or intimate in nature. That didn’t matter to me, neither happened, and either one would end my career and my freedom. I cut off all contact. I tried to get her served with divorce papers only to learn from the process server she had abandoned the home. I went to survey the damage to find almost all of my clothes had been bleached, along with our new living room set. The new dining room table and chairs had been gouged. Weeks worth of trash and raw food had been left out. The refrigerator had been turned off, leaving hundreds of dollars of food to rot. The whole place smelled like death. She had also taken all of the electronics , my passport with stamps in it from around the world, and the painting I had inherited from my beloved grandfather who had passed away she knew this would hurt me the most. All said and done, 7 grand in property damage and another 1500 in stolen property.

","What Happened When You Became Friends With “The Quiet Kid”?

So my sophomore year of highschool we had two new kids come to our school they were brothers and about a year apart in age. They didn't really talk to anybody except each other and hung out by themselves everyday at lunch period. Anyways I had first period with the oldest brother we'll call him chris and got sat right next to him. He was really good at art and I was okay at sketching so we became friends through drawing and asking for tips. Anyways we ended up being good friends and eventually I became friends with his brother as well and eventually they started hanging out with my friend group it was small like four or five people. But this is where things start getting shitty chris and his brother were Mexican always had a Buzzcut and wore baggy clothes and the school I went to was public but it was full of rich white kids who were wannabe gangsters and thugs. In reality they were just a holes. Anyways there was one group that was really bad about it and one of them would constantly pick on me and try to get me to fight him. Now I'm not afraid to fight and I know I can hold my own but I had anger issues in highschool and when I would fight I would blackout and that I didn't like because I wouldn't know what was gonna happen. Anyways one day this kid pushed me past my limits. He was carrying a lighter and got the metal top hot and ran up ten held it on my arm. I shoved him back and he started laughing calling me a beach for moving away. So I ended up kicking the shit out of him and when I say that I don't remember what happened but from what I was told I hit the kid and slammed him on the concrete and kicked him a couple of times before security got there. Well anyways fast-forward a week later and chris, his brother and I are at a park where we would go to just mess around and smoke or drink chris and his brother did a quick run to the taco bell for food while I stayed and watched our stuff. I got a snap from the kid who previously got his butt kicked, we'll say jon, it was a video of him and his friends in a car yelling were gonna mess you up and things like ""you messed with the wrong people."" I pretty much just ignored it, usually they were harmless and didn't really follow through with anything they say were going to do. Then I got a text from chris saying that they were headed back and about 10 minutes later a car rolled up at the park  and Jon and his two little goons got out of the car and they were hooping and hollering. The came running up to me and so I got up and the first one hit me before anything was even said so I started fighting with this one and I got grabbed from behind and pulled down on my back and thats when the first kick landed he kicked me right in my ribs and I guess thats about the time when chris and his brother got back with the food because I remember someone being taken off me then the rest was just blackout and from what I remember the cops got called on us and when I came to I was sitting next to a kid who was out cold and chris was still going after one kid who was trying to get in his car and leave then the cops came and we told them everything that happened. It ended up being self defense and the other kids got charged somehow one of them ended up with a nasty gash on his arm and claimed that chris and his brother had pulled a knife on him while he was getting in the car but there was no real evidence for that and the lady who ended up calling the cops said that she didn't see any knives being pulled out so that was probably just a load of bullshit to get himself out of trouble. But yeah the quiet kid or quiet kids pretty much saved my butt."
"  how cops use clever questions to gather incriminating information. Examples include inquiring about drinking, eating, hobbies, events, and academic majors.




","What are some Clever questions asked by cops to get you in trouble?

College students listen up. The first thing I learned in undergrad law classes and being a black woman is that when you’re stopped or pulled over, cops are NOT trying to make small talk with you, they are simply trying to get more information by doing the whole good cop bad cop thing. They make you think they’re on your side and making small talk and they’re trying to get more evidence or incriminating statements from you. Here’s the best example; A pair of officers pull you over for suspected drinking and driving and asks how many drinks you’ve had tonight. Of course, you know what they’re trying to do. At this point one officer goes back and says
 “hold on, let me get blank.”
The other Officer stays at your car and seems like they’re making small talk. Also, you could just not you know be selfish and risk everyone’s lives by driving drunk but whatever I guess.
They ask you questions like “So what did you have for lunch today?”
The reason is The more you eat, the more you can drink. Empty tummies means less tolerance for alcohol. And  “Are you in college? What organizations?” They’re Trying to judge your lifestyle. This is very prominent in small towns, college towns, and college areas. If you say you’re a part of a notoriously party organization they can see that you are likely to be drinking at that time and are better at holding liquor than somebody else. Also
“You look like you lift or play sports. What do you do? Sounds cool, tell me about it.” 
If you lift weights or play something that builds muscle you can handle more alcohol. If you do an activity that makes you skinny and speeds your metabolism, like running or ballet, you handle alcohol worse but it gets out of your system fast. Another one is 
“What y’all do today? Did you go to the event that happened earlier today?” 
This Might seem harmless because they’re asking about an event that happened hours and hours ago but it could be very telling about what you’re up to now. Like maybe there’s after parties or something. Now This one is also huge in college areas,
“What are you studying or what do you want to do?” 
College things. Certain majors attract certain people. Some majors people are more likely to know the law and their rights, so the cops need to step up their mind games."
"  a relationship lacked intimacy and communication. Loss of attraction and desire led to decision for divorce. Both cared but wanted fulfillment elsewhere.




","Women who stopped doing it with your partner during the relationship, what was your reasoning?

Have been in a tangoless marriage for 17 years.
Reasons changed over time . Started with my husband rejecting my initiating for years. He says it was work stress related and then morphed into performance anxiety, none of which he shared at the time with me despite my begging to understand what was going on for him . After many years of that and him being intense and distant and crabby and difficult to deal with in day to day life and my getting rejected I lost interest in trying to connect on any level. Then I lost my attraction to him over time because we weren't connecting intimately both sexually and relationally and basically became caring, room mates that ran our lives and home well together and enjoyed a lot the same activities hiking, camping, gardening and caring for our home.
Eventually we never talked about not being sexual only because I gave up asking and inquiring and trying and he never said anything or made advances either. Talking about any issues is and has always been completely up to me he won't voluntarily address anything on his own and then if I do try to talk about something and ask for his thoughts and feelings it's like excavating to get him to open up. He just shuts down and gets flustered or goes into the self blame, l'm meaning him such a failure as a husband mode. My approaches to talk were gentle and genuine and non threatening just open hearted. So now the thought of anything intimate with him makes me cringe because in my mind and heart I have friend zoned him for lack of a better description. Been to marriage counseling 3 times and currently in marriage and tango therapy. I decided I'm tired of trying and told him that I want to divorce last week. Life is too short and I need and want a more fulfilling relationship . He's devastated and it's heartbreaking because I do care for and love him despite where we are and have been in our relationship. We are both attractive fit people that take good care of ourselves so there aren't any physical limitations or obstacles for us in terms of being sexual or having any reason to have things be the way they have been. That's my story and reason."
"  how confident, passionate, and mutually satisfying. Their deep love, exploration, and prioritizing pleasure create an amazing sexual connection.","What Makes Your Partner Great In The Sheets?

The vast majority of women I was with before I met my wife were lousy in bed. They were insecure and didn't know their bodies or want to explore their bodies. That lack of confidence and lack of self-awareness makes a woman horrible in bed. l'Il still get my rocks off, and give a second opportunity, but if the second opportunity is just as bad, that's it no more. We're just incompatible in the sack. But just like women settle for men due to other more important factors, men do the same damn thing, so there's a lot of women out there just starfishing and acting like intercourse is a chore, and dudes will settle due to other more important factors. My wife and I dated for about three months before we made love for the first time, really getting to know each other . I didn't care if the tango would be bad, because I was in love with her. I just wanted to be with her and only her. When we finally made love, it was like a drug. She was as into my body as much as I was into hers. She was as passionate and generous as I was. Making love to her was like taking a hit of heroine, while the women I had met before her were more equivalent to drinking Substance Anonymous beer. If I had to pin it on something making her good in bed I would have to say it's the passion and eagerness she has in enjoying every inch of my body. Our tango drives are different, I'm the type to want it several times a day, but she's the type to only want it a few times a week. So we compromise and go at it about once a day and maybe skipping a day or two out of the week. But it's never a chore for either of us. We've been married for 11 years and it still doesn't take very long to get in the mood and go at it like a couple of teenagers, and I took the time to learn her body, her moves, and of course to always let her finish first. You have to be a gentleman and let your lady finish first, if you want her to stay passionate and enthusiastic. Passion. Have passion and get yourself off on your man, and you will be amazing in bed."

I then snuck up behind the robber and thumped him as hard as I could on his shoulder, right where his shoulder met his neck. He dropped like a sack of potatoes. The truck stop’s owner was so grateful, that he gave me a hundred dollar gift certificate to use in his store. He also gave me the tire-thumper, which is essentially a smaller version of a baseball bat, both as a thank-you for saving his store from being robbed, and likely his employee’s life, too. I was also thanked by the town’s sheriff (it was a small town in west Texas), and the local gazette took my picture. I was also given an honorable mention by the trucking company I worked for at the time. The robber was taken to hospital and then later, presumably, to jail.

They had totally gorgeous stuff in their showcases, and I lusted after every item. The clerk asked me quite cordially if she could show me something. I told her that I frankly couldn't afford to breathe their air. Her response made a difference in my life. She said that maybe I couldn't afford their stuff now, but maybe one day I could. She showed me everything! She let me try on everything. To me, Macy's was higher class than I felt I could enter, OK? An expensive Newbury Street merchant making me welcome? This was beyond belief! They had a set of 18k gold jewelry, all custom-made, hand-carved in a strawberry pattern that I fell in love with. Eventually I tore myself away, a dream planted in my heart. Twelve years later, when I actually had a little money, I bought a custom ring in that strawberry pattern from them. It cost about $2000, and after a couple of fittings I wore it continuously for 30 years. If that lady, who knew for a fact that she couldn't sell me anything that day, hadn't been so wonderful, I'd never have entered that shop again. Her kindness made all the difference."
"  a doctor callously declared to the narrator's mother that she had lost her baby, only to be proven wrong later.




","What's the coldest thing a doctor has ever said to you?

What's the coldest thing a doctor has ever said to you? Not to me, but to my mom. 15th of July is “Asshole day” in my family. Why, you may ask? When I was 9 years old, my mom got pregnant. I was soooooooo excited to have a sibling! But a few years after, my mom finally told me what had happened before she told me she was pregnant. When she first found out, she was so happy. Her first doctor check up was fine. She went back about a week after, and there the doctor (a different one) did the ultrasound, looked at my mom, and simply said: I’m sorry. You lost your baby. It’s dead No explanation, nothing. My mom cried but came back home as if nothing had happened. She told my step dad but not me, I had no idea of what was happening in my home. I don’t remember seeing my mom cry, she would always make sure I wasn’t around. In the next 2 weeks, she realised she still had all the pregnancy symptoms. Still had the same cravings. She was sure she hadn’t lost the baby. She went back and got an appointment with the same doctor as last time (it was at the hospital, you couldn’t really choose who you would see). When she explained that she was still experiencing all the pregnancy symptoms, he denied all of it. He told her she was doing a phantom pregnancy. That she was too old (37) to have a baby so she just imagined she was having one. She refused to accept it and demanded another doctor to do the ultrasound. It took a while but finally another doctor came to see my mom. Took him about a minute to find my brother with the ultra sound. Doctor 1 was so embarrassed he didn’t even apologize. Doctor 2 explained that Doctor 1 was still a student, hence why he made a mistake. I don’t know why that student was doing ultrasounds alone. All I know is, the first thing my mom did when coming home was telling she was pregnant. She was first told my brother was dead on July 15th. So we commemorate that day as Asshole Day and my mom usually goes out with my brother!"
"  how having a genius as a client can be challenging for psychologists, but also fascinating to witness their exceptional intellect and insights.




","How hard is it to have a genius as a client if you were a psychologist? 

You mean a real genius, not somebody who took an online IQ test or joined Mensa, or something. A brilliant person, gifted in most areas and amazing in a few. A highly gifted person who can put things together or take them apart at lightning speed. When you say the word Genius, the client who comes to mind is Mark. Mark was about 30. A high school dropout who was a senior electronic engineer at a large company, in charge of product innovation. He had his own lab, and was invited to work on anything he felt like. I had met two or three people like that before, turned loose to develop unexpected new products, but they had Ph.D.s and lots of credentials before they got their own labs. I never met a genius like Mark, before or after. One day Mark said “David, I don’t think you realize how fast my brain works.” I said “Of course, look at your job, at your age, self taught!” No, Mark replied with a smile, “I mean beyond that, totally apart from physics and electronics. Actually, I could show you if you don’t mind me getting a little personal.” “Shoot,” I said. Mark proceeded to tell conclusions he’d made about me at his first session that made him decide to use me as a therapist. He rapidly listed item after item he’d noticed, little stuff, about me and about the clinic. He was dead-on accurate in his conclusions: I wasn’t a genius, but I was smart enough to be helpful to him. I would be comfortable with certain things he wanted to disclose. And then more data about me I’m not going to reveal here! I was delighted. It was broad-based genius-in-action. It was like having a real life Sherlock Holmes analyzing me at a glance. Fun, and only a little scary. Sometimes I’d have to say “Mark, slow down, remember I’m not a genius, you’re skipping steps, if you want me to get it.” He’d laugh and spell things out for his slow-witted therapist. I loved it."
"  friend's death from cancer led to narrator's own cancer diagnosis with similar circumstances, inspiring them to find strength and fight.","What's the most incredible coincidence that ever happened to you? 

My best friend died 15 months ago of ovarian cancer in a hospital following surgery to have it removed. We were friends for over three decades. I went to be with her on her deathbed. She didn’t say much, but we had a few very good conversations in the days before she passed that I will never forget. The plan was that she would have chemotherapy following her surgery, and while I sat there with her, she suddenly said to me, “You know, with the chemo I'm going to lose my hair.” I replied, “It doesn't matter, you will always be beautiful to me.” She smiled back. She knew that her cancer was stage IV. The doctor said she also had two spots on her liver. Metastases. It actually turned out to be many more, eight or ten. She was very weak, as if close to death, but there is always that little glimmer of hope. One day when I sat with her, a nurse came into the room. Friends and family had decided it was best not to tell her just how many spots she had on her liver. It would only make a bad situation worse. The nurse did what she needed to do and suddenly blurted out to my friend something like, “And your liver is full of spots!” I could have just slapped the nurse in the face! My friend looked much more worried than before. You could see she was very affected by the nurse’s thoughtless comment. I think she gave up right there and then, she lived only a few more days. My dear friend passed only two hours after I left her. I would have liked to stay, but I was too exhausted. I had to go home to sleep. I think she wanted it that way. The next day, I came to say goodbye. Even though her body was there, the room felt empty, as if her spirit had already left. I traveled home. I was in a daze. I didn’t care whether or not the airplane crashed, I just wanted to be where she was. And this is where it gets weird. Two weeks after her death, I got this intuitive feeling to put my finger deep into my vagina after a shower — and I suddenly found this lump about two cm or one inch! Cancer???! I decided not to fret, just called the doctor’s office for an appointment. The doctor could not find the lump, but sent me for a colonoscopy. I also saw a gynecologist. He said, “This is disconcerting, I don’t want to let this one go.” Long story short, it WAS a malignant tumor, in my colon. What I didn’t say before is that my friend had surgery not only to her reproductive organ, but also to her colon, which required resection. When I was told about my own cancer, I also learned that my liver was also affected, that I had two spots on my liver. Same thing as my friend had been told only three months before. As I was trying to take in this news, my doctor continued to say that I also needed radiation and chemotherapy. “And count on losing your hair.” Another deja vu. I was thinking back on what my friend had said about losing her hair, the memory was still fresh in my mind. I started my treatment last August and went through a sh*tload of side effects and still am 3/4th year later. I was in the hospital four times, for a total of two weeks. Two surgeries. I think it was my friend who told me from the other side that I was sick. I really had no idea I had cancer. I understand everything that my friend went through because I lived through it too. It’s like I continued the journey where she left off. I am a spiritualist, I believe in an afterlife. I also believe that humans are given exit points to leave this life, but I chose not to. I'm still here. I don't know if I survive this, but I hope I do. That is my goal. My friend has given me the strength to fight."

What was the hottest inappropriate relations you've ever had? I am divorced, and the father of two outstanding young women. My youngest decided to join the Army, so being a veteran myself, I was quite proud of her. Anyhow, I went down to see her off. I got a room at the hotel they were keeping all the young kids heading off to the service as it would be easier to see her. On the night before MEPS and shipping, my ex wife, oldest daughter and my youngests best friend and I hung out, had dinner, etc. It was a good time. The new recruits had a curfew, and my ex and daughter had a long drive home. Lindsey, the BFF, kind of hung back. She said she wasn't looking forward to the drive and said she wished she'd gotten a room. My room was a double queen, so I offered her to stay, figuring she'd say no. She said yes. So, we went to my room. Let me explain to you that, I was 45, she was 20 at the time. We were both single adults. But, she was my daughter's best friend. Anyhow, I hopped on my bed and turned on the TV. We chit-chated a bit, and then she said decided to take a shower. No big deal so far. So, she takes her shower and knocks around in the bathroom for a bit. Eventually she comes out wearing a towel. She stands in front of me rops her towel and climbs up on my bed and kind of kneels/squats at the foot. Then she starts touching herself. The girl was pretty, long brown hair, tall lean body. She's just staring at me, going at it. Then she says, “show it to me.” So I pull it out. It's hard as a rock. She crawls over and starts giving the gawk gawk. In no time I finish. She swallows, and then lays down next to me and says, “now me.” So I go down in her. I think she finished twice. She was so responsive and wet. It was insane. Finally, I came up for air. We banged. The next morning we, went and saw my daughter off. We got some good and went back to my room. We went at it again. During a break in the action, we got to talking. She told me my ex wife had said I “eat vajayjay like a professional.” I asked when and why she told her that. She told me it was after they had intercourse. Mind blown. So, I was having intercourse with my daughter's best friend who had been having a lesbian relationship with my ex wife."
"  facing a life-threatening situation, a woman miraculously receives timely medical attention and her bleeding inexplicably stops, saving her life.","Have you ever almost died and had something inexplicable, miraculously save you?

Have you ever almost died and had something inexplicable, miraculously save you? After being married for 8 years and raising my 3 step-children, my husband and I decided to have a child together. My family has a long history of miscarriage so I expected to lose a couple before a pregnancy “stuck.” Time went by and I didn’t seem to be conceiving but I was pretty well resigned to let whatever happened, happen. One morning I waved goodbye to my husband who was going to be flying that day (he was a Naval aviator), got my 3 step-kids off to school and got ready for my regular yearly GYN appointment. Suddenly I felt faint and passed a blood clot. Since my family is also famous for horrendously painful and copious menstruation, I was only mildly concerned. I went ahead to my appointment because it was too late to cancel but I told my Dr. that I was bleeding. She tested my urine and found that I was pregnant but obviously, something wasn’t right. I was probably going to miscarry. She said that if the bleeding got any worse, I should go to the ER. I went home pretty much certain I would miscarry but happy that I had at least been able to conceive. As soon as I got home, I felt terribly sick and fainted. I awoke very weak and ill and passed an enormous clot. I was in tremendous pain. I knew I had to get to the ER but I was a loner with no friends and no family nearby, so I got into the car and started driving, slapping my cheeks and pinching myself to keep from passing out. When I got to the ER admission desk I was dreading the multi-hour wait in the waiting room. I had taken my step son once with a head injury that exposed his skull and he sat in the waiting room for 4 hours, while someone with a compound fracture moaned and cried on a stretcher in the hall behind us for almost as long. Today, however, the desk nurse took one look at me and sent me directly to triage. The next thing I knew, I was in a room and not 5 minutes later a doctor was there. As it turns out, I was having an internal hemorrhage and needed emergency surgery to stop the bleeding. I asked if there was some way they could wait and notify my husband first. They said that, to be frank, if they did not get the bleeding stopped inside of 15 minutes, I would die. As they wheeled me quickly toward the elevators, I felt myself begin to float above the gurney. I realized how easy it is to die—it’s no trouble at all, really. Anyone can do it. I felt peaceful. But suddenly I thought about my children whose mother had died suddenly of a brain tumor just 9 years before, and my husband who had already been widowed once. It wasn’t fair that they should have seen my smiling face just a few hours before, wishing them a wonderful day, and come home to find me dead without warning. At that moment, I reached out to my higher power. I said, “I have no control over any of this and I know it. I’m not afraid to die. But if I could live so that my children won’t have to lose another mother, I would rather stay. Please don’t make them go through it again. Nevertheless, I accept whatever happens.” The next day as I was recuperating in my hospital bed, the doctor came in to check on me. I asked him what had gone wrong, since that was no common miscarriage. He replied, “We think it was a ruptured ovarian cyst.” I asked, “What do you mean, you THINK?” “Well,” he responded, “once we got in there, we found that the bleeding had stopped and we couldn’t find the source of it.” So, two miraculous things happened that day to save my life. One, my yearly GYN checkup fell on the exact day of my miscarriage, and two, my plea to the Universe was heard and answered; although I had been pumping out blood at a deadly rate, it suddenly stopped just as I asked for mercy for my children. I believe in miracles. How about you?"

What is the most badass thing you have done as a parent for your teenage daughter? 'Mum I've just been sick and its black' That message is what my teenage daughter sent to me. My heart skipped a beat. Being a nurse I knew that there was something seriously wrong with my daughter but I tried to think positive and not jump to conclusions. Fast forward to a hospital appointment. I was sat with my daughter holding her hand and the doctor said the words we had both been dreading. ""It's cancer"". My daughter who was 15 had a rare cancer and chemotherapy was her best option. As many of you will know the effects of chemotherapy can be and usually are god awful. It was painful for me to watch my daughter go through it, I really can't imagine how she must have felt. As her hair began to fall out my daughter started to get really down. She loved her hair and her overall appearance and now she was almost grey and very thin. I tried telling her it was ok and that she was still beautiful but she didn't believe me and said she felt alone. That night after she had gone to bed I sat up for hours and thought long and hard about what I could do to help my daughter through what she was feeling. And so I decided to do something so she didn't have to go through it alone. It took all the strength I had but that night I shaved and cut off all of my hair until my head was completely bald and soft. I was aware that I was sure to be stared at and laughed at but I didn't care. My little girl was all that I was worried about and in the morning she couldn't believe what she saw. She was overjoyed though and felt a lot less scared about losing her hair. She cried tears of joy and I vowed to her that we would go through it all together. I kept my hair shaven until my daughter finally beat cancer, and then when she came off chemo I let my hair grow back. It was a horrible time for my daughter but I'm proud of her for going through it. She was so brave and I think me having no hair have her the extra confidence she needed and made her feel less alone. My sixteen year old son also shaved his head in the end which surprised me. The whole family made it as easy as we could for her. I got many looks and laughter after cutting my hair off but I didn't care, it was worth it as it made my daughter happy and feel so much better about what she was going through."
"  abusive husband's karma struck when he lost his voice, a fitting punishment for his verbal abuse towards his wife.




","Did you ever see Karma hit someone who deserved it so befittingly that it it was eerie? 

My sister was in a verbally and emotionally abusive relationship. Her husband had verbal diarrhea. Loved to talk non stop and you could not get a word in. Loved to scream and shout abuses at her too. He was always a real jerk and when she got cancer his abuse became even worse. He gave her zero emotional support. She would call me having a panic attack and i would drive over, about a 20 min trip to calm her and comfort her and he would be in the next room ! He threatended her with divorce. “You're no good to me anymore “ and he constantly threatened to cut her off his medical aid. He would go drinking and come home drunk and talking and shouting at the top of his voice non stop. When my mom moved in for 3 months to help when she was on her last she went into the outbuilding to do some ironing and opened the window for fresh air and forgot to close it when she was done. He came home from work and starts shouting about the window so my mom explains about the ironing and apologies for forgetting to close the window. Around midnight she hears banging outside for about half an hour. The jerk had nailed the window shut so she could never open it again for air when ironing. These are just a few examples of what he was like. I hated that man with passion for the hell he put my sister through her entire married life and the escalation of the abuse when she was at her lowest. My mum said he had the luck of the devil because he never got caught drunk driving, never had anything negative happen to him no matter his behavior but karma takes its own good time Years after my sister passed I get a call from my mom to say that I will never guess what has happened to him. “Its the worst possible thing that could happen to him”. She says “HE LOST HIS VOICE"" I gleefully guess. Nothing would be worse for him than not being able to talk. Yes, he got mugged and put on a ventilator which damaged his vocal cords. He spent the last 6 months of his life unable to utter a single word."
  hilarious beach sights: a woman's sheer bikini surprise and an Alaskan sunbather defying freezing temperatures with confidence.,"What is the most laughable thing you have seen someone do on a beach?

What is the most laughable thing you have seen someone do on a beach? Two things. First, there are bikinis that are designed to get wet, and bikinis that are designed to look good. The look good ones are sold in Macy’s and other stores, and the functional ones are sold in the surf shops. This young lady had on a white two piece that was already too sheer when she showed up. She put her towel down and the other beachgoers were waiting for it. She went into the waves, had a good time and then walked out…. and looked down. Screamed. Ran back into the water. Someone close to her stuff got her towel and took it to her. It wasn’t just sheer, it just didn’t exist when it was wet, totally transparent. The second one… I was jogging on the beach one brisk December day. Temps were in the lower 50’s, and the wind was howling, I gave up after a half mile, and decided to just go home. I was wearing a windbreaker, sweater, and jogging pants and was freezing my ass off. I picked a mound of sand as my turning point, but when I got close I saw that someone had made it. This lady had hollowed out a depression into the sand and built a berm around her. Looked like she’d fallen from the heavens and left a crater. And in this crater was one pretty young lady wearing a two piece and sunglasses. I had to ask and she said the weather was fine, she was from Alaska. I just went with it and left. She wasn’t going to die from the cold."

We adopted her when she was 3. We get a few racist remarks because we are black and she is Chinese, they think she needs a Chinese family to have a good life. She is happy with us, so nope! She can’t talk because she is completely deaf and no hearing ads or a cochlear implant will help, she will be deaf forever, unless there is something invented in the future that helps. She is able to say mama because she reads our lips and tries to copy the shape our lips make and make sound, that’s the only word she can say. She came home from school one day, since she can read lips really good, she is in a hearing school, but in a special class for deaf people or hard of hearing people. She told her siblings who then told us, that her teacher told her she was “sick” in sign language, Because she is from china. In sign language, you can’t name a virus unless you finger spell it, my daughter is only 5 so it’s hard for her to put words together by spelling it out. Her teacher was telling her that she brought Covid into this world and that she was sick with it because it started out in China. She was only 2 when Covid started, she didn’t even fully understand about Covid. The teacher believed every Chinese person had Covid, no matter how old or young. Since my daughter had “Covid” She wasn’t allowed to go to lunch that day and eat, she wasn’t allowed to learn with the class, and she wasn’t allowed to go outside and play. When they were learning, she was sitting in a chair far away with a mask on. I didn’t call the police, but I called the school and got her fired and she might be going to court for a hate crime."
"  family copes with father's arrest for child-related offenses, enduring stigma, bullying, and fear, while supporting each other through difficult times.","What is the hardest thing you have ever done?

What is the hardest thing you have ever done? Going to school the day after my father (a teacher there) had been arrested as a paedo. It came out of the blue. I was being taught by my dad (a weird experience - as anybody in the same position will tell you) when, one day, the headmaster came into our class half way through and took my dad away and replaced him with a supply teacher. Not a big deal I thought until my mum picked me up from school that evening. Obviously my brother and I asked what was happening and we were told not to worry about it - he wasn't well. We carried on for a day or so until, as my friends were round, my mum called me into her room (it'd never happened before). She told me that my dad had been arrested and taken to jail for possessing child videos (and substances) and that he'd be away for a while. I was then packed off to scouts and then back to school the next morning while a letter was sent around warning the parents that this had happened. That was hard for me. Knowing your dad has gone off to jail is hard (visiting him is harder) but going into school and seeing your younger brother having to fight off bullies because his dad's a 'paedo' is heart-breaking. However, on top of all that is your mum. You know she's upset, how wouldn't she be? All of her (former) friends know that she's married to a paedo and might be staying with him. But telling her that you and your brother are OK and are doing well at school and not having any problems despite the constant (schoolyard and societal) mockery of a man who you love is hard. Especially when she's only staying with him because of the family that she now has. To be honest, the whole thing is hard. Seeing your dad, a man who you idolized stripped down and robbed of any friends he had is tough. Seeing your mum holding on to her relationship and being ostracised by her friends for doing so is hard (she's so nice). Seeing your brother getting expelled from school for defending himself against bullies picking on his biggest weakness is hard. And being told by social services that your dad is a predator and wasn't punished enough by the law courts, so would be losing his children. That's hard too. But, overall, it's the fact that, to this day, our whole family feels constantly wary that we'll get uncovered as the 'family containing a paedo' and have to relocate. We're a family living in fear and will continue to be so as long as we stay in the country."

Jane was placed with her aunt, Jane’s deceased father's sister. We didn't see as much of her after that, but I took my daughter to the court hearing when the stepfather was charged with criminal sexual conduct with a minor. It was awful to hear. He spent a few months in the local jail and a year on probation. Jane lived with her aunt for several years while she finished high school and a year of college. She is now happily married with a son, after years of therapy."
"  step-mother's pettiness during house-building included constant comparisons and adding a room to ensure her house was bigger.




","In what ways have people shocked you with their pettiness?

In what ways have people shocked you with their pettiness? My ex-husband and I decided to build a house while we were still married. After we signed the contract, his step-mom decided she also needed a new house. Of course, theirs was to be bigger and better than ours. (She’d once told someone that her children will never drive a nicer car than hers) I was like whatever lady, you’re twice my age, you’re supposed to have better things, because you’ve got more money. She told all of the family about them building a house, but didn’t tell anyone we were. They were all shocked when we told them at Thanksgiving! Fast forward to the building process. She was constantly comparing my $180k home to her $300k home. “what kind of countertops are you getting? Well III’m getting granite.” “What kind of tile are you getting? Well III’m getting travertine.” “What kind of cabinets are you getting? Well III’m getting made-on-site fuckety wood.” You get the picture, right? Everything she had was going to be soooo much better than mine. At one point, I actually said, “I would hope you’re getting all this stuff, your house is almost double the cost of mine!” We’ve now been in our homes for a few years. One of her family members was over at the same time we were and she mentioned how much bigger her house was than ours. I said, “Oh! Actually, ours is about 4 square feet bigger than yours because of the upstairs.” I wasn’t really intending to show off, really just trying to reiterate that our houses were pretty equal in size. Well this chick went and added on a room to her house! She says it’s because she needed a bigger closet and a storm shelter, but I really think she went and dropped another $50k, just to be sure her house was bigger than mine."
"  child sets up water bed in closet, fearing it would fall through the floor. Family secretly removes it before dad returns.","What did you do as a child that you hid from your parents?

What did you do as a child that you hid from your parents? Back in the sixties, my younger brother got a seven by seven foot water bed. My dad refused to let him set it up in his upstairs bedroom, because he was sure the floor wouldn't hold it. But my brother had a seven by seven foot walk-in closet attached to his room, and he knew Dad never looked in it, so he set the bed up in his closet. After a few days, he got to thinking about how heavy it really was, and if it fell through the floor, it would end up on our parents' bed, so he decided to take it down. My dad always came home at noon for lunch, left at twelve-thirty for work, and then walked back in the door every night at exactly two minutes past five, so that gave us four and a half hours to complete the task. He got the garden hose from the garage, attached it to the water bed valve, and ran it down to the bathtub below his bedroom. Wouldn't logic say that water would run down that hose into the tub? No way! Nothing we could do would make it go down the hose. Finally, Mom came home from work at 2:30. She already knew about the bed being set up. She was a lot more lenient than Dad. She decided to help us, and we decided that we'd roll the bed to top of the stairs, down the stairs, and sideways into the bathroom, and put the valve right into the tub to empty it. What were we thinking??? There was Mom, my brother, my sister, my best friend, and my boyfriend, and we all got behind it to roll it, and my boyfriend stayed in front of it to help guide it. When we got it to the top of the stairs, we realized how silly our idea was. There was no way we could control it going down the steps, and there was a thin wall about four feet from the base of the steps, separating them from the living room. Soon as we got it around the corner and leaning into the stairs, we realized we couldn't hold it, and I yelled at Tom to get out of the way. He leapt from the top step to to the bottom landing and took one step sideways into the kitchen, just as the bed came down the steps and hit that wall. The wall didn't break! The bed bounced up and hit the ceiling a few times before coming to a sloshing halt. We were all shaking by that time. We shoved and rolled the bed about seven feet sideways into the bathroom, got the valve over the tub, and started to squeeze. Mom ran in started to fix supper, I rolled up the hose and put it back in the garage, and my brother and friends squeezed the water out of the bed. It was finally empty about quarter to five. My brother rolled it up and ran it out to his trunk, my mom set the table, and at two minutes past five Dad walked in the door. We all sat down to a normal supper, and nobody ever told him just how strong his house actually was. But we all had a hard time keeping a straight face while we were eating that supper!"
"  losses, both the death of a loved one and the loss of an unborn child, have caused immense and indescribable pain.","When was the hardest you have cried? 

When was the hardest you have cried? I wanted to go anonymous as I don't want anybody to feel sympathy on me. I was married to wonderful person on may 29, 2015, who always take care of me more than my parents. Since it was an arranged marriage, we decided to have baby a year later so that we can understand and have time for each other. A year later, when we decided to have baby my brother's marriage got fixed. So we planned to postpone for another 3 months. But god had another plan for us. My brother died on an accident and it brought a total loss to the family. May be I'm unable to express here how his loss impacted our life. My mother still not recovered and my father is just living his life. This is the day I cried most and I'm still crying and could not overcome such loss. After 3 months of my brother's loss, myself and my husband decided to have baby, so that baby can change my parents thought process . I also got pregnant and parents were happy and was proudly saying that I'm going to bring back my brother. In April 21, 2016 in anamoly scan it was told that baby had a congenital heart disease. It was told by the doctor, that, Even if the baby is born, it has to be treated as soon as possible or it will be dead. The doctor claimed even after the operation they cannot assure of life of the kid. So we both planned to abort instead of making the baby to suffer from birth itself. That day I cried like a hell and it took an year to recover from the incident. Somehow we managed to overcome from the incidents and tried to live a happy and normal life. A year after abortion, again we planned for baby. Now I'm 7 weeks pregnant and went to scan centre to check my baby's heart beat. But doctor said this time yur baby has died already and doesnot have a heart beat. There are no words to describe our pain. As others say, God will have other plans for you. It is not at all true.

"  profoundly saddened, the protagonist, with medical assistance, delivered the heartbreaking news to their spouse of the inevitable end.","How did you tell your spouse it was over?

I needed a doctor to help me tell her. She had been struggling with breast and ovarian cancer since February 2020. Just under two and a half years later, the doctor pulled me out of the hospital room to talk to me in the hallway. He and two other doctors—one was on the phone—explained to me there was nothing else they could do for her. She needed back surgery because of a broken vertebra, but she wasn’t a candidate for surgery. Her cancer had spread to her spine and destroyed the blood cell factory, not letting her produce the blood cells she needed. She had had so many transfusions that didn’t help that they couldn’t give her any more. It was time for hospice. I didn’t want to tell her. I had told her all along that I thought she would win over the cancer. Now I had to tell her I was wrong, that I couldn’t remain her biggest cheerleader, that it was time for her to give up. I was trying to hold back tears. The doctor who pulled me out into the hallway asked if I needed help telling her. We went into the hospital room, him on one side of the bed and me on the other. “I’m so sorry,” I said to my wife of nearly 24 years, “but …” I couldn’t finish. I could no longer hold back the tears. I gestured to the doctor, who also said he was sorry, but it was time to go into hospice care. She looked at me, with a very sad look on her face, then nodded slightly, accepting the decision. The end came quickly after that. It took some time to arrange for transportation to the hospice center. By the time all the arrangements were made to take her to the hospice center, it was dinnertime the next day. Having been through hospice situations with my first wife, who also died of cancer, and my in-laws, I knew it night be overnight, or it might take several days. I got there with our son as the ambulance crew was taking her in. We waited in the lobby a few minutes while they got her situated in the room. She was the only patient at the center at the time. Within a few minutes, we were encouraged to go see her. When we went in, a nurse was using a stethoscope to check on her. Again, I expected that. Then the nurse said, “She’s actively dying. It won’t be long now.” I hadn’t expected that. Within about 20 minutes of her entering the building, she had died. A dear friend had gone to get food for the family while we waited. My wife was dead before she arrived from the restaurant. I gathered the friends and family who were there and led us in prayer. Then we ate, stunned at what had just happened and how quickly it had occurred.How did you tell your spouse it was over?"
"  facing financial struggles, the protagonist endured walking for groceries, foreclosure, reliance on assistance, and humiliation, but eventually fought for child support.","What’s the hardest thing you’ve endured being poor?
 
As my marriage began to unravel, my (then) husband became worse and worse with money. First, he wouldn’t come home for days, leaving the kids and me with no car. That meant if I needed groceries, I had to walk 8 blocks to one store or 11 to another and carry them home. I couldn’t ask my father for a lot of help, as my mother had cancer. More often than not, I was helping her, and my father was filling in when I couldn’t. One day, I found I had no bread or milk for my children. I went to the cabinet where I kepy emergency money, only to find the jar empty. The “proud papa” took it. I scooped up whatever spare change I could find and went to the grocery. At the counter, I found I was short. I was ready to cry. I tried to think of which should I put back, when the grocer told me someone behind me paid for my groceries. I cried as I took the bag and said thank you. Walking home I thought it couldn’t get any worse, but I was wrong. The jerk stopped his paychecks from going to our joint account. He wouldn’t pay the mortgage or utilities. I had a bank book that he forgot about, and with that I paid bills for as long as I could. I put my children on food stamps to put food on the table. I put a lien on my house since you couldn’t qualify for services if you owned a house. Passover was coming and I didn’t have a penny. Agencies that claimed to help made you feel like you were robbing them if you asked for food. I got one parcel and was sick. Everything was dated a month or two before: the juice, other items, and the raw chicken - which smelled so bad I threw it out. I begged my brother for $200 so we could have a nice holiday. He gave it to me - and never let me forget it. If he needed a favor, he reminded me that I owed him. I was so ashamed I never told my parents. The house went to foreclosure about the same time the utilities were shut off. I borrowed money from my father to move and pay first month’s rent on an apartment. When I finally started working I put aside $10 a month to pay him back. It was hard, and I barely made ends meet. My kids hadn’t gotten new clothes at this point in nearly two years. I was still chasing my separated husband to get him to court. Finally, I hired three court servers for $200 a piece to wait at each exit at his job. He was served his subpoena to appear in court. After some delays - didn’t come with a lawyer, fired his lawyer in court - the judge asked him why he didn’t take care of his family. He said I’m having problems with their mother. The judge said “Why didn’t you buy food? Pay for the house? Clothes? What did you do for your children?” He kept trying to say he was having a problem with me and the judge got angry. “What did you do with your money?” the judge asked. We presented photos of his new sexy sports car - bought with the money that was supposed to take care of his children. The judge told him “I’m done talking to you.” Then she asked me what I had done for my children. I showed her the paperwork for food stamps, proof I sold jewelry and used the bank book I had to pay utilities. I just got a job, so we were under a roof. She told my then husband “you earn almost 3 times as much as your wife and you did nothing for your children?” She ordered child support at the maximum allowable by law, as well as back pay of money he should have paid since January (it was now October). He screamed “where will I get that kind of money?” The judge said “sell your sexy car, that doesn’t have room for your three children.” My attorney stepped up and said “we would like to show more mercy than he showed to his children. He can pay off his wife in semi monthly checks.” He took the deal, never realizing he would be paying me for three years. The extra money coming in meant my kids could get new clothes for the first time in two years, I paid my father back the money he lent me - and I gave my brother $300 when he lent me $200. I told him the extra $100 was for him to shove it anywhere he wanted - I didn’t want him to talk to me like I was dirt again. In spite of my brother’s protests that he didn’t mean to humiliate me, he did in fact keep the extra hundred. Today, I’m a bit better off. But I still need to watch my money. Sometimes I get depressed and buy junk I don’t need. But I try hard to avoid that."
"  a parent's mistake: Spanking child for not eating, unaware of his autism. Realization of harm caused led to change and growth.","What was the biggest mistake you made as a parent? 

I was raised to believe a little swat on the bottom was harmless. My four oldest kids got spankings when they deserved them. Not severe. Hardly anybody would have considered it abuse. Then came kid number five. Another thing my parents taught was that you ate everything that was served. I figured I couldn't go wrong teaching my kids the same. What could go wrong teaching kids not to be picky eaters? This worked pretty well with the first four. Then came number five. He wasn't more than 2 years old. Certainly not yet three. He was still in a high chair, and still wearing diapers. He was old enough to be off baby food and eating regular food with the family. I don't remember what was served that night, but he was NOT going to eat it. The rest of the family was finished, and he had not taken a single bite. I told him he was not leaving the chair until he ate. A half hour later, the food was cold and he still wasn't eating. I pulled him out of the chair and spanked him. put him back in the chair. He still wouldn't eat. I was coming unhinged. Yelling at him. Scaring the life out of him. He still refused to eat. Must be he couldn't feel the spanking through his diaper. So I scooped him up and spanked him a bit harder. I was already horrified by my own actions, but I couldn't seem to stop. I don't know how many times I spanked him. 2? 3 ? More? Even my wife was afraid of me. She asked me to stop. She begged me to stop, finally she demanded I stop. I just couldn't let that kid win a battle of wills. More baggage from my own upbringing, you ALWAYS obey your parents, no matter what. I stormed off and shut myself in the bedroom for the night. Next morning, already ashamed of my previous days actions, I got up and got number five out of bed to change his diaper. What I saw made me sick to my stomach. Bruises. I had struck my own son hard enough to leave bruises. Already ashamed… Now I was horrified. How could I have done such a thing? To make matters so much worse, a few years later we found out he was on the autism spectrum. As many kids do, who fall on the spectrum, he has certain tastes and textures he can't stand. At that moment, nothing I could have done to him would have made him eat that meal…because he couldn't. He wanted to please me, but he couldn't. His brain would not let him put that food in his mouth no matter what. That’s the worst thing I've done. And thank goodness I learned my lesson. I have never laid a hand on any of my children since. Number five is doing great, by the way. He is 15 and in tenth grade. He struggles a bit with social interaction, but he is very smart and he does have a few good friends."
"  parents drowned newborn kittens, lied about their death, and created a traumatic experience for the child who loved the family cat.




","What is the most horrifying thing your parents have ever done?

When I was about 6 and my brother about 4, our parents drowned 5 newborn kittens that our family cat had given birth to. At the time, we were lied to about what had happened. It took me years and years to put the pieces together and figure out what really happened to the 5 kittens. I loved our family cat, Popeye, and she loved me so much that she decided to give birth to her kittens under my bed, which was in the coldest room of the house. My mother had to make a little bed for Popeye out of towels because Popeye had settled down on the bare floor to await the birth. (She was normally an outdoor cat). I could hardly wait for the kittens to be born. One morning, I woke up and she had given birth to 6 little kittens. They all looked healthy although one of them was the “runt” of the littler or so my mother said. Not long afterwards, my mother told me that all the kittens had the “flu” and they had to take them into the garage to help them. She told my brother and me that it was very important that we stay out of the garage. Then my parents took the 6 kittens with them. I heard my mother and father out in the garage. There was a very large sink in the garage but my parents rarely used it. I was in my bedroom but I could hear the sound of the large sink being filled with water and my parents talking fast but trying to keep their voices down. There was a lot of splashing and this went on for quite some time. I remember feeling anxious and wondering what they were doing and why it was taking so long. Finally they emerged and with sad faces (but with averted eyes) told my brother and me that all the kittens except for the “runt” had died of the kitten flu. I protested that they had all looked healthy and I wanted to see them! They said that was not possible because they had hurried up and buried them. I wanted to see the grave and I also demanded to know why the “runt” survived and other ones didn’t. (I was a precocious kid). They refused to show us where they buried the kittens. By this time, there was a lot of tension and this often resulted in a severe beating. I backed down and went to my bedroom, shut the door, and cried silently for hours. My brother, who was quite timid, also retreated to his room. We were not allowed to have emotions, much less express them. Occasionally, as the years went by, I would ask my mother why the kittens died so quickly and other questions. Things just didn’t add up. Friends at school had told me that 5 kittens wouldn’t up and suddenly die at the same time so it must not have been the flu. As I got older, I began to notice more and more strange things about my mother. One significant thing was the tone her voice would take on when she lied about things. It had kind of a chirpy sing-song quality to it that wasn’t present at any other time. When she told my brother and me those many years ago that the kittens had died suddenly of the flu, her voice had that exact same quality to it!!! I was a teenager when I had this sudden epiphany. However, I eventually gave up asking my mother for more details about the kittens because the tension level would shoot up so fast that I feared for my safety. My heart still aches for those poor little kittens"
"  while browsing a pawnshop, a young man discovers his great grandfather's stolen rifle and surprises him with its return.","What is something horrifying you found at a thrift shop?

A buddy and I were walking around and just hanging out when we came across a pawnshop that looked as if they hadn't been cleaned since the 60′s. We decided to take a look around and see if they had anything interesting. I noticed they had some guns for sale and decided to see if they had a decent shotgun for a reasonable price. I had just turned 18 a month ago and wanted to get a shotgun. I was perusing their very limited selection and didn’t see a shotgun that fit my criteria but did notice they had some surplus rifles. It was then I saw something that made my blood boil. Let me set the stage so you can envision what I saw: The floor was covered in a mint green tile that looked as if it had been original to the shop. The walls were painted a very dingy off white with noticeable yellow streaks from years of people smoking in the shop. Their guns were at the back of the store. There was an L-shaped glass display case that held pistols and knives. On top of the corner there was a spinning rack of long guns. Behind the counter was a vertical wall rack of even more long guns. On one side, there was a display wall of different firearms. Now that you have that image burned into your mind- on the display wall, there were various surplus weapons, and one caught my eye. It seemed familiar but I couldn't place it. I asked the guy behind the counter if I could look at that weapon and he said sure. He proceeded to tell me how he came by it- the previous owner had sold it a couple of months ago saying he needed the money for his car or something. As soon as I held that weapon, I knew exactly where I had seen it before- it was my great grandfather’s 1903 Springfield .22 trainer that he had taught me how to shoot with. How did I know it was his? On the stock, there was some damage that I was responsible for. I bought the rifle and took it home. When I got back home, I called my great grandfather and asked him if he still had that old .22 from when I was a kid. He said it should be in his safe and I was welcome to come shoot it any time I wanted. I told him I would be there on Saturday and would have a surprise for him. On that Saturday, my uncle met me at the door and said that Pap was in a bad mood and that today wasn’t a good day. I asked why and he said that Pap had found out that his old .22 was missing. I told my uncle that I knew it was missing and that it had been missing for a few months. I asked him to have Pap meet me on the back porch as I had a surprise for him. Pap came outside and apologized for wasting my time and that he would find that rifle if it was the last thing he did. He asked what my surprise was and I showed him his .22 rifle. I quickly explained that I had found it in a pawnshop and bought it. Pap was a quiet person, but that day, he went after my uncle, kicked him out of the house, and threatened to put him in the ground if he ever touched his guns again. Once Pap calmed down, he asked me how much I had paid for it. I told him “not much”. I knew he was trying to get the amount from me so he could give me my money back. Every so often he would ask me what I had paid for that rifle and my response was always “not much”. In his will, he stated that “The 1903 may not have cost much but it's yours along with all my guns.” I still have that old .22 and it will be in the family for a long long time."
"  nephews neglected, warned authorities, but no action taken. Tragic outcome: one child dead, the other severely affected due to parental neglect.","Was there a time when you warned everybody, no one listened, and something bad happened?

Twelve years ago we had two nephews, ages 5 and 7. They were being neglected by their parents, Chad and Krista. Chad is my husband’s brother and Krista was Chad’s wife. My husband’s parents complained all the time about what bad shape the kids were in. They were not toilet trained, were not in school, were always dirty and always had diaper rash. Oddly, rather than being concerned about the boys’ welfare, my FIL seemed more just embarrassed about the situation, and MIL loved to gleefully snark about what a bad housekeeper and mother Krista was. After they moved to Colorado, my husband visited and saw just how bad off the kids were - all of the above and more - they were also malnourished and not meeting cognitive milestones normal for their ages - he tried talking to his brother about it. We tried inviting them for visits to get to know them better and see what we could do to help. Chad blew him off about his concerns, said he had it under control and implied it was none of our business. They cancelled every visit, usually at the last minute. During one phone conversation, Chad even told my husband he wished he’d never had kids. My husband and I were horrified, he was at home when he said this and what if one of the boys heard him? One serious issue that the boys had was related to the diaper rash and lack of toilet training. They had developed a condition called encopresis, in which they were basically either very constipated or had explosive diarrhea. They were apparently being treated with enemas and suppositories, but not in any consistent manner. We later learned that they were being locked in their room (with no access to a bathroom) every day while Chad went work and Krista slept in. So basically they could not be toilet trained in that situation and would be left sitting in soiled diapers until she got up. The older child later told me “usually I hold it, because it hurts when I go poop.” The “holding it” is what directly led to the encopresis condition, and he did that because the diaper rash hurt his bottom so much when he defecated and had to wipe. Obviously, had the boys been kept clean with regular diaper changes and toilet trained on a normal schedule, they would likely not have developed this condition. After getting no where with Chad for a few months, my husband called social services. He told them everything, especially about the encopresis and malnutrition, but the person would not listen. She was very dismissive to my husband, and we later learned that the only thing they did was check the home school registry. Five months after his call to social services and them doing essentially nothing, the younger child died, about a week before his 6th birthday. He died from an obstructed colon; his autopsy report described a baseball-sized ball of feces that was blocking and enlarging his tissue, and turned necrotic. The other child nearly died. This is a whole other story, but the horrible Teller County Colorado social services department pressured us to foster him even though we really had no means to do what he needed. He was also terribly malnourished, weighing 36 pounds at age 7 years and 9 months. After he was with us for a week he started vomiting because his colon was completely obstructed too. We got him to the hospital and he was there for 3 weeks. They said that his colon had stretched to 3/4 the width of his abdomen because of the encopresis. We don't know what eventually happened because we insisted that he be placed with a family that lived near his medical care (we were a 2.5 hour drive away) and who could better handle a special needs child, but there was a discussion about removing part of his colon because it was so damaged. If the Teller County Colorado Social Services department had done their job, my nephew might still be alive. Had my in laws been anything but selfish, stupid and spiteful, they might have done something to stop their grand children from being neglected so badly that one of them died and the other one nearly did."
"  adopted sons treated no differently than birth son; love, pride, and expectations for all are equal. They are family.","Can you ever love your adopted child as much as if they were your own flesh and blood?

When I took my 18 year old son to the doctor for a sinus and ear infection a couple years ago, I leaned knowingly towards the doctor and said, “Along with my incredible athleticism, he also got my ear infections.” (Hilarious. While my son hit the genetic lottery athletically, his ears have always been a problem, with tubes inserted six different times in surgery.) Both the physician and my son looked at me like I was as dumb as a sack of hair. “Dad, I’m adopted. Nice try.” In my mind, I was making a hilarious joke about sports, but I was dead serious about the infections. I have a birth son and two adopted sons who are both African-American. They knew they were adopted as soon as they knew what the word meant. We told them their adoption story just as often as we told our oldest his birth story. Both were stories of celebration and fulfillment. We have an open adoption with one son and are in regular contact with his birth mother. With the youngest we have contact with his two younger “half brothers” who were also adopted. Despite this, all involved, especially my sons, make it clear I am Dad and my wife is Mom. In my mind there is no difference whatsoever in how I feel about my three sons. They are my sons and I am their father. I can get equally as proud when they do something great; and I can get equally as angry when they do something dumb. I have the same high expectations for all three, and I have the same sympathy when they try and fail. When I think of my sons, I don’t think of them as the “adopted ones” and the “birth son.” My oldest has been proud of his brothers their entire lives and has NEVER wavered in his love and acceptance. He is nine years older than the youngest, yet when he is home they are inseparable. My wife, my oldest, and my youngest are remarkably alike. My middle son has my sense of humor to a T—sometimes we finish each other’s jokes. My wife and I didn’t just want children, we wanted a family. A cohesive, loving unit that supported each other’s growth, challenged each of us to be our best, and had each other’s back no matter what. Families come in a million different shapes and sizes. Ours is only one of them."
"  a employee stuck at desk due to impractical uniform, causing drop in productivity. Proposed hiring more staff as a solution.","People Who Make Thousand by only Sitting and looking pretty instead of doing actual work, how’d you get that job? 

For the sake of clarity, I'm going to say I work in an industry which is similar to warehousing. Same logic in the grand scheme of things. In my branch, and several surrounding branches, there are only two staff members to keep the place running so we all have casual uniforms; Just a polo shirt and appropriate pants and footwear. I mainly do administration work and have a team member who works in the back end of things, but I'm capable and willing to jump outside when required of me. Examples of me needing to work in the back would be if we have a huge rush, or if I need to send my team mate to help at another branch or out on the road to collect stock and I have to fill in for him while he's gone. It's a pretty good set up because working outside really breaks up the monotony of being stuck at a desk all day and it's easy enough to do both parts of the job when I need to. Some genius in head office decided he wanted to change the uniform for any and all admin staff to something a little more corporate and dressy. I can only describe this uniform as a three piece suit made with the heaviest fabrics known to man. Suddenly I've gone from wearing a polo shirt which is comfortable and easy to move around in, to wearing a white long sleeved business shirt with a vest, jacket and neckerchief. Complete with a skirt, stockings and a slight heel. I straight up look like a flight attendant working in an industrial warehouse, and can barely lift my arms high enough to hold my steering wheel on the drive to work. It was a poorly designed uniform and I was so incredibly uncomfortable wearing it; I was very quick to voice my anger. I first mentioned how it is unfair (borderline cruel) to expect staff to wear such a thick and layered uniform when we live in Australia; particularly in a place known for our consistent high temperatures and harsh sun. I then asked how I would be expected to leave the desk to operate machinery and do heavy lifting in a suit, skirt and heels. I was met with the promise that anyone working in admin and wearing a corporate uniform would not have to leave their desk to do any back-end work at all. I raised another concern, stating that we did not have enough staff for them to make this particular promise and still maintain our quality of work and hit our deadlines, and was met with a strong guarantee that I would not have to do any physical work in my day-to-day operations. I was all but ordered to sit at the desk to look appealing for clients and never move from there... Okay then, no problem. From that point onwards, I followed their instructions. I never left my desk. There would suddenly be long wait times for orders and fulfilments, because my team member was on the road on a job and there was no one on site to continue his work until he got back. If my team member called in sick, I would spend the day pushing back deadlines with clients which affected our targets and our reputation. Funnily enough, my team mate only started getting sick because I had to have the office aircon on freezing temperatures so I wouldn't get heatstroke at my desk. I was honest with clients who had complaints, and explained that I would usually step in to help to make sure their needs were met but was specifically instructed not to anymore, and then redirected their complaints through to customer service in head office. After a few months of this I was invited to a meeting with three of my direct managers and a HR representative. They were clearly upset about the drop in productivity and amount of complaints we were receiving. I let them all say their piece before reminding them I raised these concerns to them months ago, and was merely following instruction given to me which were abundantly clear that I was to take care of admin work at my desk and do nothing else. I let them know my hands were tied, so all I could do was look pretty and placate clients when we inevitably couldn't meet their needs as promised. I suggested hiring more warehousing staff to fill in the gaps left by the admin staff who were now chained to their desk by their uniform and unable to ease the pressure of the workload like we used to do. I could see that comment definitely hit them right where I wanted it to and they couldn't argue with me for following their instructions, so I was told they would get back to me on a solution moving forward. Well, here I am at work two weeks later, typing this post while wearing my old polo shirt uniform. I was fully prepared to find another job if their ""solution"" wasn't reasonable, and maybe I still will look to leave this place. But, I'll take the win for now"
"  man confronts judgmental sister-in-law, prompting emotional response. Wife's mixed reaction adds complexity to family dynamics.","AITA for telling my sister in law that it's no wonder nobody likes her because she's a spoiled, judgmental mother ducker?

My wife and I are married and we are expecting a baby together. My sister in law, Molly, is the golden child in my wife's family. My wife has mentioned that to me before and she doesn't speak to her parents very often, or her sister for that matter. My experiences with Molly have been interesting to say the least. When I first met her she asked me intrusive questions about intimacy, money, etc. We left because she wouldn't stop. She judged my dad for having me as a single dad by choice, using a surrogate. That was after she called me a liar, insisted that I had a mom and when she accepted that it was just my dad and me, she insisted I must have been adopted by him. She called him selfish, said he was a bad father. All kinds of things. We left then too because she again would not stop saying that crap. She always believes she can tell people what to do and they should listen, because she thinks she knows best on everything. My wife and I ended up becoming more distant from Molly when Molly seemed to seek us out just to share more of her ""wisdom"" with us. Then a few months ago she reached out to my wife and said she had nobody else but their parents and how her friend had broken up with her by calling her names and saying she was insufferable. My wife was trying to see if she and Molly could be closer. She had Molly apologize to me and they were slowly building up a relationship. Then several days ago Molly asked what we were naming our baby. My wife said we were not sharing it until the baby was born. She told us to name the baby Emily or Henry so the baby doesn’t have a dumb name like mine. My wife told her we were not taking suggestions for names. Molly told me I shouldn't be like my dad, I should be better and not give our kid a dumb name. She brought up how her parents thought she had the best baby names. My wife told her she didn't care what their parents thought, that this was our baby and we would name them. Molly told her that she shouldn't discard their parents since they raised them and that she was always the wiser one and people need to listen to her more because she gives out good advice to people. Then she suggested my father had bad motives for having me alone and I snapped. I told her it was no wonder nobody liked her or wanted her around because she's a spoiled, judgmental jerk and I was sick and tired of hearing her stupid effing advice because she's clueless. Molly burst into tears and called me an asshole. My wife laughed and told me it was what she was thinking. Molly then left and later sent a text to my wife saying what I said was so mean."
"  a boyfriend lied about being gay, cheated, lost friends and family, faces financial struggles, and caused property damage. Legal actions underway.","Use me? Cheat on me? Enjoy losing your friends and family and have fun being ignored at work. Bonus points for possibly become homeless

I just found out 2 days ago that my boyfriend of 4 years is gay. Our relationship was a lie. He used me to cover his intercourseuality because he wasn't ready to expose himself (he told me that himself). He pretended to love me for 4 years. He acted like the perfect boyfriend for 4 years. We were discussing marriage and kids. He even took me to looking at engagement rings..... All while he was having an affair with a man. To top all that, his boy toy called me 2 hours after i walked in on them. Why? To tell me that he was bi and we could all just be together... Are you kidding me? Idk he was making fun of me or if he was really stupid enough to think that was a good idea. But yeah. If you're gay but act straight i f'ing hate you. What's worse is that my family believes i should have been nicer to him because ""gay people have it rough enough already"". So because he's gay then i can't be mad? I can't be angry? I need to be nicer? To him? After his boy toy called i texted my now ex if he was seriously making fun of me and he just said that it wouldn't be a bad idea. So i lost it. His mom and i were very close so i texted her a lengthy message explaining what happened and i told her that i can't stay in contact with her at least not for the time being. She was shocked but understanding of why i need to go NC. Well, his parents disowned him. Not for being gay but because of what he did to me. The idiot went on social media to complain that his parents disowned him for being gay but multiple family members commented and exposed him for the shitty human being that he is. Some of his co workers had him on fb and Tik Tok and they saw everything and now no one at work talks to him because of what he did to me. His friends were disgusted when they found out. His friends always liked me and they're also really big on monogamy so they didn't want to be friends after they learned the truth. He needs to move out because we lived together and now he can't afford rent on his own but his budget is very tight so he doesn't have many options. AND! They broke up. My ex had a fit when his mom called him. In retaliation he broke the TV, my laptop, cut some of the clothes i still had at the apartment and smashed the coffee machine. So yeah, his boyfriend didn't like his outburst and he ended things. Edit: Yes, i am sueing him for the damages Update: I want to start by saying i wrote this post in a state of anger and i was too emotional to realize how bad it sounded. I do not hate gay people. I have no problems with the community. I'm sorry if i came off as a homophobic beach. I really am not. I was just emotional so i will like to apologize. I understand the community is going thru a lot and i didn't want to come out as insensitive. So I'm sorry. Now the actual update. I received some comments and PMs from people that advised me to get a restraining order and make sure he can't find me , i unfortunately didn't consider them enough and as some predicated he followed me from my bff's place to the grocery store and he trashed my car. I'm talking slashed tires, broken widows and what i think it's oil all over my car. Thankfully the parking lot has cameras and the police identified him in no time. He was arrested. I am definitely filling for a restraining order and I'm looking to move to a different city. I will have to see him again in the court room tho. Also, his ex boy toy agreed to testify that he witness my ex breaking my things at the apartment. My ex is also going to be examined by a professional due to his actions it appears he may be suffering from some mental illnesses. I've contacted his parents and they are in shock but they still refuse to have any contact with him."
"  mom's son harasses girls, she blames victims. Girls expose him on social media, and boys publicly shame mom daily. Revenge succeeds.","Mom called girls sluts because her son harassed them. 

She gets a taste of her own medicine. I finally have the best revenge story for you guys! This story started about 1 week ago and the revenge part started 3 days ago. I'll try to keep it as brief as possible but it is going to be long. (It is veryy long). A new family moved into a few building few buildings down from ours. They seemed normal at first and didn't interact or socialize with anyone else other than their direct neighbours. Most of the people living these buildings have been living here for a lot of years and know each other very well. Now to the story- The son (AH short for asshat) is a creep. He harassed a lot of girls and women this past month or so. He is about 17-18 years old. He passes lewd remarks, whistles, catcalls, tries to grope, pushes/elbows, follows girls and women. He followed and tried to grope a 14 year old girl who told her mom. Her mom talked to other mom's before approaching the beach mom aka AH's mom. The mom's found out that many of the girls had been at the receiving end of his harassment. Even the women older than him and the newly weds. The remarks he passes are very vulgar and crass to say the least. The mom's visited the beach mom to talk about it on Sunday. And guess what the beach mom said? ""Tell your daughters to not dress like sluts. What is my son supposed to do? Do their Pooja (pray) like they are devis (goddesses)? They will get what they deserve. My son is only talking, keep an eye on your daughters otherwise other men will do more than just talk.""# YES. SHE SAID THIS. When they told her he was also harassing married women, she said ""Ask these newly weds to keep their spicy side for their husbands in their bedroom."" Needless to say everyone was pissed. All the girls got together and sent messages to his college friends and groups on social media about his behaviour. But it's the boys and young adult men (specifying because they are all 18-19 years old) that stole the cake. They immediately started buddying up to AH and congratulating him on getting away with being a ""hero"". He certainly felt very proud of it and full of himself. And from Tuesday evening the revenge party started. Some of these guys along with AH were standing near the gate of AH's building entrance when beach Mom arrives from her work. As soon as she came near them all the guys started making remarks on her very loudly. Some of those included- ""Arey aunty apni spicy side uncle ji ke liye rakho bedroom me (Aunty keep your spicy side for uncle in your bedroom)""# ""Aise chalogi toh tumhare saath chalna hi padega (if you walk away this way then I'll have to come with you)""# ""Palat palat palat- (look back x 3)"" And more. Most of what they said were words uttered by AH himself and beach mom herself. AH was mortified and angry but couldn't do more than cuss them and leave because they were about 4-5 guys. This has continued everyday twice a day. In the morning when she leaves for work, in the evening when she returns and whenever someone comes across her when she is out for whatever reason. She has received comments on the way she dresses, the way she walks, the time she comes home etc. All of this is done infront of her son and whenever he objects he is told to keep his slutty mom in check because the guys are only talking, what are they supposed to do? Pray to her? Finally AH broke down and cried yesterday but didn't apologise. He just called the girls and guys names and left. beach mom tried to approach the parents of the boys and to her dismay found that most of the boys were brothers or neighbours to the girls whom her son had harassed. Quite a few mom's also told her to not be slutty as it was a bad influence on their sons. One awesome Dad shut the door on her face saying he doesn't talk to women who cannot parent their children. "
  engineering students create an indestructible mailbox to thwart a vandal. The vandal injures themselves and fails to sue the professor.,"What Happens When Engineering Students Are Asked To Truck-Proof A Mailbox

Yes, I know there are a lot of mailbox stories on here but I just learned this story from my Dad involving my Uncle Dale (family friend who passed away a few months ago) and figured you guys would get a kick out of it. Years ago, back when Uncle Dale and Dad were university students, their engineering professor came to their class with a problem that needed solving. His mailbox was getting broken by someone driving by every night. He and his wife had put up something like four or five mailboxes and all four or five times, the mailbox had been knocked over by someone driving a red truck. This professor offered extra credit to any group of students who could come up with a truck proof mailbox that not only fit with city regulations but within a budget of $20 (which back then was a good size chunk of change). Well, if anyone here knows anything about engineers (as Dad puts it), they love solving problems. And if it's engineering students, they'll make it an experience to remember. Dad and Uncle Dale got together and got to work. They found a steel bar that fit within mailbox regulations (posts have to be a specific height, width and depth) and filled the inside with a mixture of concrete and steel rebars. Once the concrete had cured, they welded 8 rebars to the sides of the bar, bent them in half and stuck it inside a bucket. To add extra weight, they filled the bucket with the heaviest rocks they could find. As a finishing touch, they painted it brown and black (to look like wood) and put ""the ugliest mailbox we could find on sale"" on top, welding it down for good measure. They brought this monstrosity into class (more dragged it because it was so heavy) and told the professor to bury the bucket where the mailbox stood. Since they were the first to turn in their project, the professor agreed to give it a try. That night...the professor and his wife were awoken by a metallic BANG!!!!! followed by a lot of cursing. They went outside and wouldn't you know it, there was that red truck speeding away, the mailbox still standing. At the base was a broken wooden baseball bat. Two days later, the professor gets a bill in the mail for a hospital visit. Turns out when the passenger hit the mailbox, he did some serious damage to his arm and shoulder. They were planning on suing the professor but the professor hired a lawyer who basically told the plaintiffs ""You're just going to admit that you were vandalizing the mailbox multiple times?"" That shut them up. To the best of my Dad's knowledge, the mailbox is still standing. The other students who still brought in mailboxes had theirs gifted to different professors throughout the town and are also still standing."
"  expelled from school due to lack of accommodations for leg condition. Family sued county, leading to reforms and settlement.","School expelled me for Mom's anger. We sued the county and caused a reform. 

Not sure if this fits this sub, but felt like posting my story. I have no issue with removing it if it doesn't quite meet the standard. So I have a really bad leg, (I've had 13 surgeries, long story) and had just started at a new school. After the first 3 weeks, I had to go in for another procedure on my leg. Not that big a deal to me, I've been here before. Upon my return I had documentation of my restrictions, as well as special amenities that were required. The big three were that I needed extra time to get from class to class, must have someone to escort me, and needed unrestricted access to the elevator. All of these got me recurring problems such as constant harassment by teachers and security about my being in the halls during class time, and why was my cousin out too (he was filling the role as my escort, as I have anxiety problems and we had the same classes). These first two were annoying, but easy enough to deal with. The real issue was the elevator, as I was told multiple times that for security issues I couldn't have a personal key due to it sharing the same functionality with the interior door keys. I would never have had any issues with this, as I was told there would always be someone on the same floor as my classes to open the elevator for me. This of course, was untrue about 75% of the time. The lack of elevator access meant that I was always stuck in the halls when other students were going class to class, and was consistently late due to having to wait for someone to come by and open the door for the elevator. This also meant that I would sometimes be stuck waiting through the entire lunch period, and due to my absences couldn't afford to simply go to lunch after the fact. After about 3 weeks of this, I was tired of not getting to eat lunch. So I did one of the stupidest things I could have attempted and tried to use the stairs. For context, I was not on crutches, I was on a full blown walker. About halfway down to the landing, I fell. Hard. As lunch was letting out one of my friends found me, got someone to help pick me up, and carried me to the office. Another of my friends went to find my other cousin (the one who normally escorted me wasn't there due to being sick, so I was without escort because I couldn't bare the though of, gasp a stranger escorting me), who when getting to the office managed to get me to calm down enough to give them my mother's number. Now, my mother is quite hot tempered, but can keep a level head normally. When she heard I fell, she was there in record time. When she got there, she immediately asked what happened. I told her I didn't want to miss lunch again, so I tried to use the stairs. Big mistake, as that set off a Tsar Bomba sized explosive. She immediately turned around, and DEMANDED for the Principal and VP to get their asses in here ASAP. As soon as the principal and VP walked in, she started berating them in a fashion not suitable for most adults to hear, let alone kids. When the VP made an off hand remark about my condition, my mother was swarmed by local sheriffs that provided security for the school's entrances and office as she physically went after the VP. We were escorted out, and after looking at the file and realizing my cousin and I had the same address they figured out that I didn't actually live there. Now, my grandmother's address was listed as she looked after me after I left school up until around 8pm. She also was raising my cousin after an issue between her and my aunt. They used this as grounds to expel me, and told her ""I can be some other school's problem now."" I was then enrolled at the school near my house, and had to have yet another surgery to repair the damage that was done as a result of my fall, and redo the work of the previous procedure. I had gotten multiple statements from teachers as well as my doctors, and my parents were moving forward with a lawsuit naming the VP, Principal, and the county school boar. We were contacted by a lawyer who had won multiple cases against our school board, some of which went to the State Supreme Court, and he told us he would take our case Pro-bono. He was getting tired of going against the Board, and though a case like this would be what it took to try and fix their shit. Fast forward 9 months, and I was walking out of court with a settlement to cover all my procedures, as well as a written confirmation that the school would be going through a complete administrative overhaul, and that the Principal and VP would be let go, and have their administrative credentials revoked in our state. My new school was let know day 1 my medical requirements and my need for a personal elevator key by the Superintendent and the head of the State Board of education."
"  buffet horrors: Spoon licking, ice cream vomit, gluttonous puke, candy stash, purse wings, off-menu demands, drink complaints, egg theft","All you can eat employees, what is the most disgusting display of gluttony you have witnessed? 

Been working in a chinese buffet for 6 years, here are my best ones:
-Kid putting chocolate pudding in his plate, licked the big spoon used for pouring it (the one used by everybody), and put it back in the pudding... I saw him and had to change everything.
-Guy about 18 years old at the ice cream counter, didn't have time to react and puked in the ice cream cans and on the floor. Looked at it, said nothing, and just walked away back to his table.
-Drunk dudes coming it around 6PM, they ate full plates in like 20 minutes, and puked everything under their table. We had to move every client out of this big section (capacity of about 60 places) because the smell was so bad. I was the one that had to put a mask on to clean everything.
-Extremely fat guy brought a big bag of candies (kind of smarties), took it out of his pocket, put a shit ton of em on his desserts, and put the candy bag back in his pocket. I was his waiter and I think he told me about 4 times that we should have these candies in the buffet so he wouldn't have to bring his own.
-Old lady putting a plate full of chicken wings in her purse (probably to bring back home or something)... no bags nothing, just bare chicken wings directly in there.
-A regular client asking me where was the coffee flavored cake (we have a rotation for desserts, so that cake wasn't there that day). I told him and he asked me if I could get some for him in the back store. After he insisted like 3 times, I finally gave up and grabbed a piece in the fridge and gave him.
-We charge the drink (2.50$) but it's all you can drink. We see plenty of people drinking about 10 full glasses of Pepsi and they complain when I bring the bill and we charge them 2 bucks and a half for it. Some even insisted to talk to my manager.
-We serve take-outs, and someone came to get his order. He looked at the buffet and asked me ''do you think I could grab something to eat real quick?'' while smiling. We often get this asked as a joke, so naturally I play their game and answered ''yes of course!''. The guy literally walked over there, took an entire egg from our salad bar, ate it in one bite, then came back to pay his take-out... I had no idea what to say, and he just left like that."
"  an employee endured a toxic workplace, strategically manipulated the system, and caused chaos before leaving on their terms.","How I Took Down My Toxic Company.

I was working in an organization that was super toxic. So much so that we were a revolving door- most employees stayed only for a few months. To counter this, our management put a 3 months notice into everyone’s contract including the existing employees (it’s not strictly illegal where this happened, but very unusual). I believe the idea behind that was to make it harder for the employees to find a job outside as potential employers didn’t usually want to wait for 3 months. However this didn’t work as most people simply quit and waited for a month or two before starting their job hunt.
I was there for almost 4 years. I needed the money, so I put up with whatever abusive shit was thrown at me. My boss was a guy we’ll call Vince (not actual name). Now Vince was not particularly good, but he sometimes respected the fact that I was the most tenured grunt in this organisation. Do note that after about 2 years, I was doing a LOT of additional work in addition to my official responsibilities, primarily because I was the only one who knew how to do those (everyone else had already left). This will become important later. Enter Rajesh (also not actual name). Rajesh was poached from a somewhat infamous company and was literally flown in from a different continent. He was brought in to “Strategically improve” our division. This was quite strange given that our division generated most profits. Within months, Rajesh made the environment even more toxic. He pulled Vince’s team under him and got Vince fired, and he actively encouraged us grunts to spy on each other. Rajesh also had it out for me from day one (until today I don’t know why). He started making my life much harder than the others. This culminated in him taking me aside and telling me that I was not pulling my weight. Now at this point I was doing quite well in the organisation + I have been doing a LOT of additional work critical to our business since only I knew certain systems and processes (see: high attrition above). So I was quite angry. I started looking out (I wasn’t still brave enough to quit and start looking). Fortunately I was able to find a job that was willing to wait the 3 months. So it was my turn to take Rajesh aside and tell him I quit. Boy Rajesh was pissed! He went from denial (“You can’t quit!!”) to negotiation (“what if I give you a raise at the year end”) before acceptance. Thus I was serving my notice and working away like an honest bee (my usual work + the additional work). At this point I was called in by HR and told that Rajesh wanted me gone. The insane part was that they wanted me TO PAY THE COMPANY for the 2.5 months shortfall in notice!!
I obviously refused, then went back and checked the contract. Turns out that a notice of less than 3 months could only happen through mutual consent, and the initiating party (company if they wanted me gone sooner, or me if I wanted to leave earlier) had to compensate the other party for the shortfall. The next day, I stopped doing almost all of my work. I logged in and logged out my hours and did jackshit. I stopped doing any additional work I have been doing, and started taking it really reaallyy slow on my primary job responsibilities. Since no one else understood the details of what I did, I knew it would be very hard for Rajesh or HR to prove that I was doing any of this on purpose. Then I sat back with my popcorn. Soon there was a complete meltdown all around. Rajesh would pull me into meetings and scream and try to bully me, and I would say nothing but smirk to his face.
Next they tried to have someone else learn the additional work I used to do from me so that they could do what I did. Remember I said earlier how I was the only one who knew some of the old systems and processes? Well, now I claimed I didn’t really remember any of them, so obviously there could be no handover. Rajesh could do nothing as none of this had been my responsibility or part of my contract, since the leadership had been only too happy to see me do this for free.
Soon my workplace turned into a dumpster fire. The HR/Rajesh smartened up and offered to buy out my notice if I cooperated and helped transition my work. I refused. Then, to twist the knife further, I started having meetings with fellow grunts (remember, everyone was always a newbie) and encouraging them to leave as well (indirectly, nothing that could implicate me). HR tried to get me to leave twice more, but I ended up serving the full 3 months (remember the mutual consent part?)"
  a couple who are Disney enthusiasts face pressure to remove their Disney-themed decorations from their home for a relative's wedding.,"What’s The Worst Part About Dating A Disney Adult?

My (35F) husband (38M) and I are what you would call “Disney adults”. We used to work for the parks in college and met there. For us, it has sentimental value as well as being something we both loved from childhood. Now, we are conscious to not be those Disney adults. We can hold conversations outside the movies and parks. We both work well paying jobs unrelated to the company. We have other hobbies and interests. Our son isn’t big on Disney and we’re cool with that. It is just something that we enjoy, as well as our daughters. We nurture all of children’s hobbies and interests. We also don’t blow all our money on this stuff. I know I may sound overly defensive, but we get a lot of comments from people who don’t know us well. Anyway, we live in a renovated farmhouse on a bit of land that includes a barn that we finished off, with hopes to make it a guest house one day. In the meanwhile, we’ve had a relative get married here and it was gorgeous. Now my sister (28F) wants to get married on our property and we were all for it. Everything’s been planned for months and the wedding is in June. It’s set to be outside completely but if it rains, we can move the party into the barn. The only reason a guest would have to go in our house is to use the bathroom. We have 2 on the first floor. The only Disney items are Winnie the Pooh hand towels. I told my sister I’d replace them with regular ones. Wedding space has no Disney items. However, she wants me to take down everything Disney on the first floor of my home, as guests will see. We have a lot of Disney items, pictures, paintings, blankets, funko pops, decorations, figurines, dishware, etc, all made for adults and a lot of it subtle or vintage, but you can still tell it’s Disney. One, this would be a massive undertaking. It’s not as simple as shoving stuff in a closet. We’d have to pack it up and find a place to store. The sheer amount would require at least 2 hours of packing. Not to mention storage and unpacking after.Two, it’s ridiculous to me. Who cares if people see? She says it looks tacky and she doesn’t want people to remember her wedding for that. I told her no. We’re decorating the outside and barn as she wants. We’re letting her use our property for free, which she keeps bragging about to friends as it’s saving them a ton. When my husband and I stood firm, she whined to our parents who told us to grow up and take it down."
"  person accidentally made a batch of potent edibles for their family on Christmas Eve, resulting in a prolonged and overwhelming high.




","I Got my whole family mega high on eddies for 48 hours over CHRISTMAS

So as the title says this wasn’t today, it all started on Christmas Eve. I’ll set the scene, it’s Christmas Eve at my family home with my parents, brother, sister, my gf and my brothers gf. All of us are in our early 20s, besides my parents who are mid 50s. They have never had a problem with us smoking zaza and would do it with us on occasion. A few months before, me and my gf had made a batch of edibles and got pretty high off them but nothing too crazy. So on Christmas Eve I thought it would be a great idea to make a new batch of similar strength and get the whole family high as we are rarely all together as all us kids are at different universities.So I start making the edibles but I can’t remember exactly how much zaza I used in the first batch. I had 6 grams on me and used it all as there was 7 of us so nothing too crazy, or so I thought. Now when we made the first batch me and my gf cut the brownies into 12 pieces and only ever had 1 at a time. However my mum has a fancy brownie maker which cuts them for you into 9 pieces. So straight away I knew these would be a bit stronger than before but still I didn’t think they would be that strong, boy was I wrong. So I finish baking the brownies at around 2pm on Christmas Eve and the family descends on them like a plague of locusts. Half an hour goes by and no one is feeling anything. Mum is just about to serve up dinner, we had it early as we knew no one would be able to make it later. We sit down to start eating and then one by one we start to feel it. My dad, who has a history of passing out after smoking zaza, finished his dinner in a matter of seconds and crawls off to the sofa as he “can’t stand up” and needs to “lie down”. So off he goes and about 15 minutes later we finish our dinner and go to see where he has got too. We walk into our lounge to discover him already asleep on the sofa. So about 20 more minutes go by and we are all feeling pretty high at this point. My mum starts freaking out and saying she “doesn’t like this at all” and needs some way to stop the high. I tell her that there is no way to stop it and to just ride it out. After about another 30 minutes my dad suddenly gets up from the sofa like he’s the Undertaker and dashed off to the kitchen as he “needs more food”. He then proceeds to make about 15 slices of toast for everyone to eat as well as about 5 for himself. At this point we realise that no one has wrapped any presents yet and my 85 year old grandmother is coming round for Christmas tomorrow. So we hastily try to wrap some presents but no one really gets anything done as by this point no one can even stand up anymore. Now me and my brother are seasoned stoners but even we can’t move more than 2 steps before falling to the floor and needing 15 minutes rest to get up again. We decide that the only thing we can do is to try and sleep it off and hopefully we feel better in the morning. So after a while of all 7 of us struggling up the stairs we finally make it into our beds and try to sleep it off. We all wake up on Christmas Day still whacked out of our minds and not able to function properly. We then realise that we have to go and pick up my brothers friend up who is joining us for Christmas but none of us are in any state to drive. So, after explaining to my grandmother that none of us can drive to pick up the friend as we are all too high to move, we had to call an Uber to bring the friend to us which cost a small fortune as it was Christmas as he was about 25 miles away. So we soldier on through Christmas all of us trying to just not be high anymore and we finally make it to the end of the day still high as a kite. We go to sleep and wake up the next stay and guess what, we’re still high as eff. I genuinely thought it would never end but eventually later that day we all started coming back down to planet earth. So yeah, I ruined Christmas by getting my whole family too high to move."
"  Korean-Canadian pretends to be Chinese and Japanese, forming friendships based on lies, struggling to reveal the truth.","TIFU by pretending not to be Korean

So I'm Korean-Canadian but was born in Canada and have grown up here my entire life. I ""speak"" Korean but it's about at the level of a talented ten year old with a funny Canadian accent.
eff-up happened yesterday. I’m walking down the sidewalk and who I assume are a man and his daughter (who appears around my age) are puzzling in Korean over a directory sign. I ask (in Korean) if they need any help. The dad seems excited to meet someone who speaks Korean. The girl seems shy and doesn't say much besides ""thanks."" They’re looking for a nearby mall so I offer to walk them over there since the train station I need is nearby anyway.
The dad asks me where I learned to speak Korean so well. This is where the eff-up begins. I'm pretty insecure about my spoken Korean, so when the dad asks where I learned the language, it sounds like he thinks it’s obvious I’m not “actually” Korean. It doesn’t help that his daughter is ridiculously pretty, and I want to impress her for some reason. So, I lie. Stupid idea. I say I’m actually Chinese and learned Korean on my spare time, changing my skills from “mediocre for a Korean person” to “impressive for a Chinese person.”
Alas, the dad immediately switches to Mandarin which I can’t speak a word of. This would have been the time to come clean. Instead, panicking at having been exposed, I do my best confused face and then pretend I misspoke and said the Korean word for “Chinese” (Jung-guk) when I in fact meant “Japanese” (Ilbon). Ha-ha, sorry, my Korean isn’t very good, right?
Of course, the daughter suddenly bursts into fluent and excited Japanese, which I also can’t speak a word of. I’m in too deep at this point and can’t tell them I’m Vietnamese or some other variety of Asian without making myself even more suspicious, so I do the only logical thing and say I am indeed Japanese but don’t actually speak Japanese (but learned Korean cuz lol I’m a traitor to my Japanese heritage).
We reach the mall and I’m all too happy to bail at this point, but the girl, who suddenly seems super interested in me, asks (now in practically perfect English – damn polyglots) what I do. I say I go to the local university. She excitedly tells me that she’s starting at the same university in September, and that she has just arrived in Canada from Korea. Her “dad” seems just as excited by this news and asks me to take care of her once school starts and he goes back to Korea.
It turns out that the girl is actually Japanese but went to some exchange program in Korea for a few years, and that the “dad” is actually her Chinese-born Korean teacher/ sponsor who accompanied her to Canada. So, not only did I pretend not to be Korean to two people who weren’t even Korean, but I pretended to be Chinese to a Chinese man and have now convinced a Japanese girl that I’m Japanese.
So I exchanged contact information with the girl and we’ve been talking a lot online since yesterday. Turns out she’s super nice and funny and interesting and accomplished. We have a ton in common too. We have the same major, and we’re the same age, though she’s three years behind me because of her exchange program. She seems super stoked to be friends with me since she doesn’t know anybody in Canada and has been talking to me a lot. I’m becoming increasingly aware that I can’t pretend to be Japanese forever to this girl and I need to tell her I’m actually Korean, but early on she asked me about my family and I went even deeper into the lie, telling her my parents are from Kyoto (picked a random city), etc. I've done effed up, Reddit, and I feel terrible about it."
  a religious upbringing clash: Islamic household attending Catholic school. Literal interpretation realization leads to strained relationships and confusion. ,"What Was Your Dumbest Realization That Everyone Knows?

as a kid I was raised in an Islamic household. Thing with being Islamic in America is there aren't any good Muslim schools to send your child so they could learn both Faith and have a decent education. So my parents decided to send me to a Catholic school since it was closest to the values they wanted me to live by. At home, my grandmother would tell me stories from the Quoran. I loved those stories, but sometimes, my grandmother would stop her storytelling voice and use her fact voice. Like she was telling me something that happened at the store. She was using her fact voice when she was telling me about the story of how a father had to sacrifice his son to God but when he tried to bring down the knife, it wouldn't hurt his son because God had willed that his dedication meant he no longer needed to sacrifice his son. So I asked my grandmother if I could become invincible to knives if I believed in God enough and she told me ""No don't take the story literally. Take the meaning of the story."" Aka do not stab yourself. So I was like oooooh all of these stories are metaphorical. The Bible at my school and the Quoran at home are both collections of stories filled with wisdom meant to be interpreted as the situation sees fit. Like a superhero story where Jesus and Muhammad are the main characters. They're meant to help the story deliver me a meaning like Ash from Pokemon. I think you see where this is going, I thought they were stories. They're not real. And I grew up thinking that. That these religions were a way of life, not to be taken literally.
Cut to driving with a friend from school through California to Palm Springs to see her grandmother. We were talking about how hot it was and I joked about how we needed a flood to cool us down. Where's God's wrath when you need, right? She laughed and started to draw the conversation to her admiration of Jesus. We started talking about miracles and hungry people and I said ""Man, I wish we could do those kind of miracles for real. The world could use a few."" and she replied something along the lines of ""Well who knows? Jesus could be back soon"" and I chuckled. Did that thing where you blow air out of your nose and smile. I thought it was a joke. Like ha, ha Superman is gonna come fly us to her grandma's house. And she looked at me and asked me why I laughed. I told her I thought she was being sarcastic. She corrected me that she was not. Then I asked her ""wait are you saying like.. Jesus could actually, really show up on Earth""? She got upset and said yes. Then the rest of the car ride was quiet. So instead of thinking ""Jesus is real"". I thought ""wow my friend must be really gullible"".
Then once I got home, I told my grandmother about it. I thought it be a funny story. Like telling someone that your friend thinks elves are real. But she looked at me and went ""OP, Muhammad is real. And so was Jesus. What are you talking about?"" For the next 10 mins we kept talking and I started to realize that oh my god, my grandmother thinks the stories are real. Does everyone think that the stories about water turning into wine, and walking on water, and touching sick people to heal them was REAL???
Lastly, I pulled my pastor aside at school. And I asked him straight up ""Is Jesus real?"" and of course he was confused and said yes and asked me if I thought Jesus wasn't real. I told him what I had thought my whole life and he goes ""Yeah, everything in the Bible actually happened"". So I asked him why none of those miracles have happened now or at all recorded in history and he goes ""I don't know, but the Lord does and we trust him"".
So now my friend doesn't talk to me, school is weird now because all of these ridiculous, crazy stories about talking snakes, angels visiting people, and being BROUGHT. BACK. FROM. THE. DEAD. are all supposed to be taken literally. And asking questions about it isn't ok either, apparently. So yep. That's eye opening."
"  mother discovers son's new trans girlfriend accidentally. Despite initial surprise, she accepts her and plans to inform husband beforehand.","How do I tell my husband about my son's new trans girlfriend?

I have 3 sons: 32, 28, and 26. All of my sons are very successful young men and are on their own. My oldest and youngest were always very out going and were kind of party animal's in highschool and college. My middle focused on his grades and future from a young age. He moved out the youngest into his own home.
Anyway my middle had a very bad ex girlfriend. I would like to say worse but I read the rules here. Basically they dated since 17 and she cheated on him several times. My son never left because he loved her, but eventually he realized she was a bad women and left her. Only took eight years. Anyway my oldest got married at 29 and my youngest is engaged. They give my middle son a lot of crap because he is single, but I always say that his ex kind of messed up his since of love and confidence. They don't understand what he went through. My husband agrees. Six months ago he started dating this new girl, that we just met yesterday. I was happy to hear that he found someone. She is very educated and smart, according to him. They have similar personalities and interest. Considering my middle is kind of a nerd, that made me very happy to hear. Anyway I wanted to meet her immediately. My son said that she is very shy and it would take her time. Six months later she told him that she is ready to meet us. So Friday afternoon, my husband decides to grill. Everyone comes over. Then my son and his new girlfriend show up.
This beautiful girl walks in holding his hand and standing behind him. He was right, she is very shy. We all introduce ourselves and we will call her Sadie. Sadie was quiet but said hi to everyone. She honestly associated the most with our dog that night. My sons go out and help their dad cook. My daughter-in-law goes out with my grandbaby, and soon to be daughter-in-law and her are best friends to they go out together. I ask if Sadie would like to help me finish the sides and chop some stuff. She says sure. I just ask how they met and typical conversations. Eventually my middle son comes in and comes up behind her pokes her booty. She gives him a ""really"" look and hits in the arm and he grabs her and pick her up as they laugh. I say put her down don't be so rough on her. My son just says okay put her down and goes back out. I said, ""sorry, three boys. Sometimes they are little too rough, but he is harmless"". She said, ""I know he is. I used to wrestle with my dad and brother growing up too"". I said, ""your mom let her her daughter wrestle her older brother and dad? She said, ""well I used to be a boy so I guess it was different"" and giggled. I froze. I said, WHAT?. Her face went snow white and immediate tears rolled down her face. She said, ""he didn't tell you?"". I went no. She said, I think I should leave, I am sorry. I grabbed her and said no, stay here. I said ""does my son know"". She said yes he knows. She then said, I always bring it up first date so if there are issues, we don't waste each others time.
To be honest, I am very surprised, but my son has never been so happy so I dropped it. I honestly just couldn't believe it. I mean you would never know. She is gorgeous. She asked if I though of her different. I said that you make my son happy and as long as you treat him right I wont care. She just said thank you. I called my son today because his dad wants to get to know her more and wants to go to dinner with just them and us. He said sure. I brought up our conversation and he said he knows. He said that she is just really shy about it doesn't talk about it at all. She just try to run under the radar. He said that since you know we need to tell dad, but they discussed me kind of pre-telling my husband. Before tomorrow evening.  "
"  a best friend's wedding. Person arranged desserts, boyfriend offered to film. Forgot to assign them seats, spent night alone. Person hurt.




","My best friend from childhood invited me to her wedding but forgot to assign me a seat. I spent the night alone in a separate room.

My childhood best friend (23F) got married this weekend and I was so excited to be there to support her on her big day.
I’m a chocolatier, so the bride asked me if I could create the wedding favours and dessert table. I was ecstatic to help with the wedding and went above and beyond to create a gorgeous table that was a HUGE hit on the day.
I was told early on that the wedding was over-budget and to keep costs low, my boyfriend was not invited. I was extremely understanding and even reduced my rates for the sweet table as my present to the couple.
A couple weeks later, after reviewing the guest list, the bride informed me that my boyfriend could come as my plus one, but if he did, I would be moved from the head table.
My boyfriend is a wedding photographer and is looking to build his videography portfolio. Knowing that the couple didn’t have a videographer, he offered to film a professional wedding video free of charge. The bride was ecstatic and offered to move us to the vendor table so that we could network with the other vendors. We loved the idea and it was confirmed that we would be sitting with the vendors.
The day of the wedding, we arrived 4 hours early to help with the event. My boyfriend spent the time filming while I set up the dessert table and helped the event coordinator set the dinner tables. After the ceremony, guests were moved to the cocktail room while the original room was converted into the room for the reception. While helping convert the room, I noticed that our names were not on the seating chart.
I asked the event coordinator where we would be sitting and she said “good question” and left to find out. She came back to say that there was no vendor table and that if we were staying for dinner, my boyfriend and I would have to sit in a separate room as we were not on the list. The room was closed off from the reception, so we couldn’t hear or see anything, let alone talk to anybody.
I told the event coordinator that we were in fact guests and that we should be moved into the reception room. The event coordinator herself was seated at one of the tables in the room. I told her I was a long-time friend of the bride, and even originally meant to be seated at the head table. However, the event coordinator said she couldn’t do anything about it.
I approached the bride to explain the situation. She mentioned that it was definitely a mix-up and that we should be in the room. The bride mentioned that she didn’t want to undermine me as a businesswoman, so she never told the event coordinators that we were friends or that I was a guest. She left the coordination of the vendor table to the event coordinator and left it off of the seating chart. The event coordinator was not made aware that any of the vendors (besides herself and the MC) were staying for the reception and therefore didn’t think to add us in.
Although I understand the mix-up, the bride did NOTHING to get us moved to the main room. My boyfriend and I were cut off from the reception with no one to speak to, no way to see or hear, and even had to ask to be fed. As a result, I missed the entire wedding and spent the majority of the evening crying in the bathroom waiting to move the dessert table into the main room after dinner so that we could leave. My boyfriend continued to film everything as he was committed to getting a beautiful video for his portfolio.
The next morning I emailed the bride about the experience. She apologized profusely and said she was scatterbrained on the day and didn’t think to do anything about it. She feels extremely guilty and would still like to be friends. I would like to forgive her but I am still extremely hurt."
"  Instagram date catfished person, claiming to be dating a Marvel character, exhibiting strange behavior, and revealing she has COVID.","My Crazy Date Thought I Was A Superhero

This girl and I met on Instagram, in the pictures she had sent, she looked very much my kind and I enjoyed the conversations with her so I thought to ask her out. We decided to go to the movies. Now, this is where all my problems began.
I'm on the phone with her trying to figure out where she is when she says ""Oh look behind you I can see you"". I turn around, and god behold, I see someone COMPLETELY different from the pictures she had sent. In the photos, she looked about 5'6"", very pretty face and a nice body. What I saw was a 4'4"" extremely overweight girl that looked completely different from what I had seen. Now at first, I was a bit weirded out, but I thought ""Oh well, it's not all about looks"" and continued the date without calling it out as I had enjoyed our conversations prior (a huge mistake in hindsight).
We go off to book our tickets, find our seats and settle. So now the movie is about to start and she hasn't said a word so I want to start some sort of conversation with her, but every time I try to say anything I instantly get shot down because she's ""busy chatting with her friends"". Fine I thought, let's wait till the movie starts. The movie begins and I try to move a little bit closer to her but she keeps moving away, so I just let it go. She then turns around and says something about the movie which I can't remember, but a remark has to be made. This girl has never brushed her teeth, and I mean NEVER. Her breath absolutely stank, I couldn't even look in her general direction while she was speaking. But this wasn't even the problem.
A bit into the movie, this girl tells me she wants to say anything... now what she told me next absolutely shocked me. She says that she's been doing something called ""shifting"" where she ""transfers her consciousness into another reality"" and ""lives her life with other people"".. and currently in her ""other reality"", she's dating a ""marvel character that she's deeply in love with and has been since she's 10""...
Now at this point, the blood is rushing to my head, I have so many questions. Why did she agree to go on a date if she's already dating someone in her ""different reality"". Why did she never bring this up? And the biggest thought of all... is this girl insane? I'm very off-put now and just lean the other direction and try to watch the movie while not seeming very upset, keep in mind I just got rejected by this catfish because ""she's dating a marvel character in a different reality..."" I just want to finish this stupid date and leave.
When the movie is finally over, I try to explain that I'm going to leave, but she says she's really hungry and wants to go for a bite. We go to a wings place, and she orders about 5 portions of wings (I just want to leave at this point so I don't order anything). While we're waiting for her food, I ask her about her whole ""shifting"" thing. What she said next made me even more furious.
She says that she's been into ""shifting"" for two years and that she's ""deeply in love with this marvel character"". So I think that maybe she's actually able to somehow do this, and if so I ask her how often she does it. THIS GIRL TELLS ME THAT IN THE LAST 2 YEARS, SHE'S ONLY MANAGED TO DO IT ONCE. YES ONCE. She had a 1-hour dream about a marvel character, and now she apparently is dating him and loves him, and that's why she doesn't want me to get near her. This girl must be absolutely insane. But what happened next was the final straw.
I didn't mention it yet but throughout the entire ""date"" she's had a very bad cough, and I kept thinking maybe she's just asthmatic or something. So I ask her. She replies ""Oh, no I just have COVID""... WHAT?????? YOU'RE JUST TELLING ME THIS NOW? Unfortunately, it was too late for me to leave. I try to lean back and stay away from her to not catch her COVID, and the moment she is done eating I thank her for the date, pay for the food and jolt out of there."
"  man dates woman, finds out she slept with 300 people, feels insecure. They break up but remain friends.","My Girlfriend’s Body Count Disgusts Me

I was dating this gorgeous woman for about 7-8 months. We were getting along really well even if our couple had its flaws here and there. I was assuming she had an active sexual life before because she traveled a lot in her early 20s and she would sometime talk about funny/weird intercourses she experienced. We openly talked about s without judging, but I never bother asking her about her body count because I didn't care. At least, what I thought.
Well, one night she told another of her s  stories and I don't know why, but the question passed through my mind. So I asked her. At first, she stopped and thought about it. Then she said ""I don't know"". ""How you don't know?"" I replied. She proceeded to explain there's a lot and she never counted. I asked her to give me an estimate. "" Maybe around 300?"" I was in shock. 300 guys (and girls). I didn't expect the number being this big. Realizing I was surprised, she quickly told me that 50% of it wasn't that good and reminded me that I was 1 of the 3 guys who gave her an orgasm. I didn't want her to feel bad about it, so I kept it low. But deep down, it was affecting me more than I thought.
I felt small and intimidated about this number. Even if I knew she loved me, I was questioning myself if I was ""enough"". I know it stupid to think that, but I have trusted issues and it didn't help the rest of our relationship. I became insecure and even jealous at some point.
We broke up 3 months after for other reasons, but it had an indirect impact on our separation. We are still good friends and hang out time to time. So it's not all bad."
"  man picks up hitchhiker, gets robbed and knocked unconscious. Ends up at own funeral, causing confusion and distress. Lesson learned.","TIFU by picking up a hitchhiker and then showing up to my own funeral

This happened a few years ago and I was living in Zimbabwe at the time, and I was having a pretty bad day, I was going to see my auntie who lived about 400km away from me. If youre african you'll understnad that this was no small journey. So I got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a Dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction, so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in. we go to talking and he happened to be going to exact same village as me and he knew my auntie!.
Half an hour passes and we're making polite chit chat and reminiscing about old times in zimbabwe, when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over, so I do. he runs out of the car and starts making wretching noises, so i assume he's throwing up, its dark at this point so i cant really see much, so i go check on him ( first mistake). I get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he's not.....Then I here someone behind and me and before i know it im unconcious! so I wake up a couple hours later( iknow this becuase the sun was coming up at this point) without my car, clothes or wallet. so im thinking great. i look around and see im on some farmland wearing the giys clothes. SO i start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement.
I explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a days walk from where I am and they dont get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night ( which might be our thief). I start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come acroos a road, so I pitch up and start waiting, ( now i know most of you are thinking why not call someone, i had no phone with me and I dont have the best memory so I didnt know any numbers that would come in handy). after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch I let him know the situaion and he says we're in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he's willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which I thought great!
its takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and i say my goodbyes to my driver, I take down his number so i can repay him later on. At this point im starting to recoginise my surroundings, I walk for a few miles and as im getting closer to my aunties i can here a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i though was strange. Im about 100 feet from the house and i see my Son which again i thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time, but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does...he runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment. I get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent. my wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like Ive been gone for months. My auntie appears and immediately faints when she sees me.
I still have no clue whats going on at this point and im exhausted, so we rush to get my auntie inside and I see my picture ontop of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room....
So it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldnt identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was my wallet, they assumed it was me that had died in the crash. since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral preety quickly and that is what I had stumbled upon. My son still has nightmares to this day and and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitch hiker ever again."
  a widowed parent confronts their mother-in-law after discovering she breached their home and interfered with their baby's care.,"My Mother In Law Broke Into My House To Find My Baby

I am a widower. I lost my wife (Anne 34) just minutes after she gave birth to our first baby (Sammy). She had a difficult pregnancy so I took an indefinite leave 3 months before she was due. Sammy's 4 months old now and before I went back to work, I told my MIL (Sandra 56) about my plans and if she can recommend a nanny to take care of my daughter when I work. She offered to do it (nanny) for free. I told her she's free to come by anytime during the day if she feels uncomfortable with a nanny looking after Sammy but she insisted on doing it herself. So I said yes and gave her a copy of the house keys. She comes 30 mins. before I leave for work, and when I come home, she stays for dinner and leaves after putting Sammy to sleep.
Everything was fine for the first couple of weeks until I noticed that Sammy's not feeding as much. Her formula's barely touched. I asked Sandra about it and why Sammy's not feeding well. She said she's trying to breastfeed my daughter. At first I thought she was joking then I realized she wasn't. She said Sammy needs to latch for a few minutes everyday to ""activate"" her milk production. I almost lost it, I told her she cannot do that, and she needs to stop. She said she will but I caught her again when I walked in my daughter's room and she was forcing Sammy to latch. I confronted her and told her she's no longer my baby's nanny. I didn't ask for the key back as she is still welcome to come visit anytime.
I asked for a 1 week leave from work to care for my daughter and find a nanny. I found one but two days after she never returned. I called her and she said my ""Mother"" fired her the day before. I asked her to describe the woman and I was livid when I realized it was Sandra. She came in my house using her key and fired my nanny. I was about to call her when she showed up and said a convoluted story like how I hired an incompetent nanny, etc. etc. I told her to leave but she refused and told me she's calling CPS because I am endangering my child. We argued back and forth before I called the police and she was charged with trespassing.
I know my MIL is grieving the loss of her daughter, I am too. But she crossed the line when she disregarded my wishes. She is very upset with me. My SIL and BIL are calling me ruthless and I am now second guessing myself. Have I taken it too far by calling the police? Am I the A hole?"
"  fiancée gets drunk at bachelorette party, neglects person's dog who ingests alcohol and chocolate. person cancels wedding, sparking backlash.","AITA for canceling my wedding because My Fiance Got Lit With My Dog?

Me (28M) and fiancee (27F) have been together for 4 years, engaged for 6 months. I also have a 7 year-old lab mix who is the greatest dog in existence.
On Saturday, fiancee had a bachelorette party at home. I stayed with my parents but I left the dog with her because she likes having him there. However, I made sure to tell her to put the dog in our bedroom once the party gets going.
5am on Sunday I get a frantic call that something's wrong with the dog. She was drunk, so I told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. When I got there, she looked like she hadn't stopped crying for hours and she couldn't even speak. Two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. I felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.
But then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate eddies. The girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and eddies.
When we got home, I told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. I told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and I'll tell mine. She was shocked, but she took her things and left.
2 hours later, I get bombarded by messages on Messenger, Whatsapp, by her sisters, brother, brother's wife, her mom, her friends, telling me that I am insane to do this to her after 4 years. They started off defending her, but it quickly turned into insulting me.
The logical thing for me to do was look for comfort in my friends and family. Nope. They all f ing agree. My mom said: ""Well, it was a mistake, she didn't do it on purpose, besides - the dog didn't die!"" Lucky me, eh? My dog didn't f ing die!
My sister was appalled that I cancelled the wedding ""over that?!"" and even my best man said I might have overreacted. Yes, our relationship has had ups and downs, but it's mostly worked fine. But I am so disgusted at my fiancee that I can't even imagine looking her in the eye, let alone spending my whole life with her. She isn't f ing 17, she is 27!
By the way, this is not the first dumb thing she has done. She likes to text while driving, she always leaves stuff on the electric stove (like kitchen towels, the cutting board etc.) even though she has turned on the wrong burner and burnt whatever was on it several times in the past, and similar DANGEROUS things. It's not something I hold against her in the sense that I would ever mention in a fight, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried that she might end up killing herself or someone else. For example, my dog.
I'm 99% sure I will stand by my decision. But am I really an asshole? Literally nobody is on my side and I have no idea what to think."

I met my girlfriend at the time in college - we had a class together and sat next to each other. After texting about the homework every night we realized we really liked each other. One thing led to another and by the middle of the semester we were dating. We were pretty inseparable.
One day we were at school, spending the day together as usual. More background: she didn't have a car so we'd meet at school since she took the bus. I commuted 30 minutes to school in my car. That day we did homework together, ate at Moes (the burrito place), the usual.
Before I continue, know that this girl had a s x drive unlike anything I'd ever seen before. I have a pretty high libido, actually a really high libido to be honest. But if I was like an 8/10, she was at least an 11. Typical guy here, so can't complain.
Until one day we're in class (we'd only been dating for a few months, maybe less), and she sends me a text saying she wants to suck my dick. I was like ""right now??"" and she was like ""Right now."" I was not in the mood but that can change pretty quickly, so I go with it. 0 complaints here, the lecture is boring as usual, and it's a really big class so no one would pay any mind if we both left. 13-year-old-me would be cheering and jumping up and down in this situation. I see no wrong.
So we leave. It's about a 15-minute walk to the parking lot. We held hands the whole walk and we didn't say a word. I knew what was about to go down and when no one was in our vicinity she'd give me a little touch. She was always about her business and knew what she was doing. At this point I am completely turned on.
We get to the parking garage (which is decently packed by the way) and sit in the backseat. We're on the fourth or fifth floor. She proceeds to go down on me very enthusiastically. Lots of spit and such. It's winter-ish so we're both wearing a few layers, it's one of those dick-through-the-boxer-hole blowjobs. Everything is going well until she gags and immediately stops. I ask what's wrong and she starts to panic.
She says ""I think I spit too much"" and I'm very reassured like ""no, don't worry I like it a lot."" Then she says ""no. you don't understand I spit too much."" I'm a bit confused at first. Then the smell hits.
I hate puke. I hate it more than anything in the world. To me, it is the worst smell in existence. I am mortified. We had just had Moes. Tiny chips, man, tiny chips. I immediately open my door and get out. The next minute happened so fast. I'm outside of my car, dick-out, and I start puking. If any civilian walked by me right then they would have called 9-1-1, it was probably an awful sight.
I get my shit together and survey the damage done in the backseat. She is profusely apologizing, on the verge of tears. I get a rag and a spare shirt from my trunk and start cleaning. I had febreeze in the car, thank God, and I sprayed it everywhere. It was an admittedly quick and effective clean up - most of the puke was on my dick, which I wiped off. In the panic, I littered the shirt and rag (bad guy moment, sorry, it was life-or-death... I hate puke).
I get in my car and start driving home. I live with a few roommates and I know no one is home. Now that it's over with, I reassure her that it's ok, it was an accident, and I'm not mad one bit. Who gets mad over accidents? However, she was on a loop, saying sorry and super jittery. That's fine.
Life is pretty good for the next few hours. We get home, we shower one at a time (we were new to dating and the thought of a together-shower didn't occur to me / nor had we done that yet. I just remember getting home and running the shower). Then we're cuddling in my bed, fresh and clean, panic is over. Long story short, intercourse, and I finish with the most amount of swimmers I've ever produced to this day. Life is good, but it's getting late so it's time to drop her home.
We go outside, it's freezing, and we have about a 30-minute ride home. She lives with her parents who are super strict: they don't even know she has a boyfriend (cultural thing). When I went to open my car door, I realized it's locked. Not only is it locked, I see the keys in the passenger seat. Uh oh.
We're stranded. She is already a few fake stories deep with her parents and now it's gonna get bad if I don't get her home soon. Triple A takes forever and I end up having to buy her a $45 Uber home. To a broke college student, that was like 40 mcchickens at the time. Huge loss."
"  teen kisses girl in psych ward, accused of assault. Case dropped. TIFU by not lawyering up. No further updates.","TIFU by making out with a girl in a psych ward

So, this happened a while ago actually, I (17M) remember the exact day I was admitted to the psych ward. It was the day after New Years (great start to the year).
I won't mention how I ended up in a mental hospital, but I will hint that it involves drug use.
Also, just so you guys know, a psych ward isn't what it's like in the movies. It's actually rather...chill and I personally found it a good place to express myself and be a better person than I was beforehand. I recommend it highly if you feel like you ever feel like you're on the ""edge""
Anyway, after about two days of being there and surprisingly making a lot of mentally ill friends, I met a girl (16), let's call her Ashley. Going into the psych ward, Ashley was the first person to catch my eye. She was extremely attractive and very friendly after getting to talk to her.
We would talk everyday constantly, and I ended up asking for her Instagram on both of our last days at the psych ward. While waiting for our rides, I remember Ashley asking straight up ""Do you want to kiss''.
At first I thought she was trolling so I laughed and told her to stop playing. She told me she was serious, while adding a smirk to her face.
I was still suspicious, so I told her to lean in first. She did, so I decided to as well, and to my surprise, we ended up kissing. The first kiss was short and more of a puck. Then we kissed again, and then again, and then it turned into a makeout session. Keep in mind, we are still in the psych ward, just in an area where there are no cameras or nurses watching.
Then after a few minutes of kissing, I heard my name be yelled by one of the nurses saying my mom was here. So I awkwardly wave to her goodbye and excitedly skip to my freedom while saying goodbye to my other mentally ill friends.
So, I'm out of the psych ward. I feel good, and everything is good, but I ended up forgetting Ashley's Instagram so I didn't bother to try and look for her.
So, a week has passed, and I'm in school when suddenly I get called to the office. My mom is here to pick me up. I asked her why she came unannounced, and she told me a detective had called her and left her a voicemail telling me to come to the [town name] police department to talk about something that happened at the mental hospital I was issued at.
I get scared obviously, because I have no clue as to why I needed to see a DETECTIVE.
We made it to the police station and I went in and was greeted by the Detective. He makes me walk with him alone to a room where we both sat down. I felt like I was in a damn movie.
He has a few files on the table along with a recorder thing. It was small.
He says that I can leave at any time and not answer any questions at will, and then starts by asking simple questions like ""Why was I in [town name] Hospital"" and ""What people did I see?""
So I'm thinking that maybe someone got murdered and I was a witness. Then the Detective drops the bomb.
""I brought you in today, because a lady is saying you assaulted her"".
I genuinely gasped aloud and got really defensive (I must've looked really sus). I said ""who said I SA them??"" And ""I would never do that what the f?""
The Detective pulls out this photo and it's a photo of Ashley. He asks if I know her and I say yes.
Then, I told him everything from what I knew. I said that she gave me 100% permission to kiss her, and that I didn't force myself onto her nor make her DO anything. She was the one that asked first and leaned in first. I thought to myself how she could do this to me. The first week I got out of a psychward and now I'm instantly being accused of assault?
The Detective stops the recording thing and says that's all for today. He told me if I did do anything without consent, they would find out (trying to intimidate me) and that I should confess now.
I shouldn't have even said anything without a lawyer. That was also my f up.
The Detective calls in my mom privately and then we both leave. My mom was angry too, basically on my side.
So...what happened after that? Nothing. The case was dropped I guess because I never got a call back from that Detective or from any cops. I also called the police department to ask about the case, and they said that it didn't exist."
"  a victim of bullying seeks revenge on their tormentor, causing him to be mauled by bears and suffer severe injuries.","You bully me for 8 years? Enjoy missing half your body

So, to start off, I was 14, straight A student and vengeful as vengeful can get. when this happened. When I was 6, a new kid came to my school (we’ll call him Douchebag) and started picking on me, but I didn’t really pay too much attention. Fast forward a couple of years, and I’m 11. The picking transformed into straight up bullying. Calling me names, beating me up for being a “nerd”, being atheist (his family is Christian), stealing from me, he even hit me in the leg with a METAL baseball bat, destroying my fibula and tibia (they’re fine now). It got to the point where the popular kids ganged up on me and beat me up every day. This continued until that very day. We were leaving on a trip to the zoo. I was very interested in animals, so I was excited. Douchebag must have seen this, because he made my day a living hell. The time came. We got to the bears, and Douchebag came to me and whispered to me: “I’d love you being eaten alive by those things.” Before we continue, I’ll say that there was a 15-foot-or-so gap that separated the bridge we were standing on and the floor where the bears were. Back to the story. I backed off and waited for him to be distracted. I saw the opportunity, grabbed him by the legs and dropped him beside a bear. The bear must have been scared, because he started mauling Douchebag. Two other bears joined. We were evacuated immediately. I just recently heard that Douchebag survived, but is missing both his eyes, his nose, his left arm and both his legs. Nothing more satisfying than seeing the one who tormented you for almost a decade fall victim to your plans. No one messed with me after that day. Douchebag, if you’re reading this, I’m not sorry. Oh that’s right, you have no eyes."
  son regrets not knowing his silent father's courageous past as a war hero and wishes he could express his pride.,"What is something you wish you had known sooner?

My dad raised my sister and I after our mother passed away in an accident when I was 6 and she was 8. Dad never spoke very much unless you asked him a question. He did not date he just went to work and came home and took care of us. I know my dad loved us and he always smiled but getting him to talk was like pulling teeth.
In HS I was a linebacker at our little HS and dad never missed a game. My sister played the flute in school and he went to all her concerts. All the other kids had outgoing parents and my dad was 5:10 140 pounds of quiet average and I used to really envy the laughter and camraderie the other guys had with their dads and mine was just smiling and so silent.
On weekends he went fishing and took us with him if we wanted to go. We were always welcome and though I know he loved us he never had anything to say. Trying to talk to dad was just a lot of 1–2 word answers and then “glad we had this talk son.”
After college I moved away to Nashville about 4 hours from dad and then after a number of years he was in his 70s and got sick and passed away. At the funeral there were few people in attendance just some guys from his work, my sister and I and our families and an Army General in full uniform who formerly saluted my father and then sat in the back and said some prayers and got up to leave.
At the door I introduced myself and asked him if he knew my dad? He said that he had been a Captain in France and your dad was my specialty sergeant and he stopped a German advance in its tracks and destroyed 2 gun emplacements and was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. We lost 8 men that day but 25 of us survived that day because your dad was the bravest SOB I ever saw or knew.
Needless to say I was in shock. In a shoebox at home buried in a closet was the medal of honor and the duplicate they give you for ceremonies, the rosette, the citation signed by Truman in 1945, a silver star and the croix de guerre with palm from France.
God I wish I could have heard all this from Dad. Does he know how proud I am of him?"
  girl home alone encounters boys with creepy older guy. Protective dog scares them away. Grateful for the dog's presence.,"What was the creepiest thing that ever happened to you at a function?

When I was about 12, my parents went away for a function so my brother and I had the house to ourselves. We got pizza and watched movies and had the best day ever, along with our adorable German Shepherd dog called Chaka. When it got dark some boys from school showed up at our front gate calling for me. My brother stayed inside, peeking through the curtains as I went outside to greet them. I knew them well from school and was puzzled by their appearance, since kids didn’t usually go out in the neighborhood after dark.
There was an older guy (about 19 or 20?) with them that immediately made me feel uncomfortable. He leaned against our fence and eyed my body, biting his lower lip. One of the boys hurriedly said it was one of his cousins and I should ignore him.
“Come on out with us,” the boy said. “We want to show you something.”
“No, it is late,” I replied, remembering how I boasted at school that I’d be home alone.
“Okay, wait we have something for you,” the other boy said as he turned around and got something that he had hidden behind the lamppost. He returned with a brown bottle, filled with liquid, with the label removed. It was already open. “Here, drink this.”
“No,” I said and they just kept insisting I drink it, saying it wasn’t that strong, tasted good and that I’d be fine. My heart was beating in my chest. I felt nervous as the older guy kept looking at my bare legs, playing with the latch on the fence door.
Suddenly Chaka, our dog, appeared from behind me and planted his bottom on my feet. He was a huge, wolf-like dog and this low, deep rumble started to grow louder and louder as he growled. He stared the guy down who hastily let go of the latch and backed away. The two boys also backed off quickly. It was as if Chaka sensed my fear and came to give me his strength; he would fight for me. I told them to go away and leave, I didn’t want to drink their stuff. My dog sat like a statue on my feet, until they disappeared back into the darkness. My brother said he was watching the entire time for any signs of trouble, and couldn’t believe how brave Chaka had been. When my dad heard about it, he gave Chaka a big steak as a reward.
Chaka was my guardian angel. I still love him and think of him. He died in 2008. What could have happened if he weren’t there?"
"  teen attends wild high school house party, gets drunk, has unexpected encounter with a friend, escapes naked after police raid.","What's the biggest high school house party you've been to? What happened?

Warning: Please do not do what I did. The consequences for doing so could ruin your life.
Let’s go back to early 2010, when I was in my sophomore year of high school.
It was a Friday afternoon, and I was walking out of the school building after serving detention. My friend, I’ll call her Clair for her privacy, was picking me up like she did every Friday.
We drive to the local park and share a bowl and talk about school, and other subjects. As we are finishing up she mentions that some Senior was hosting a party at his house on Sunday. Although I am initially reluctant, I eventually agree to go.
Fast forward to Sunday night, and I arrive at this kids door, and am immediately greeted with a beer from a kid I’ve never seen before.
As I walk further into the house I see every single person drinking like it was their last day on earth. On the couch, I spot Clair, with a bottle of gin in her hand.
She exclaims, “JAX” in the middle of party and invites me to sit next to her. The next few hours were uneventful so I’ll skip to where it gets interesting.
As I tried to stand up I realized that walking on a few beers was harder than I thought. Clair was even worse and I had to help her up the stairs to one of the bedrooms. She asked me to close the door so we could have intercourse. To this day, I still don’t know if it was the alcohol talking or not.
After we both finish, I hear the word that no teenager at a party would ever want to hear: POLICE!!! And sure enough there were police sirens outside.
In a moment of panic I opened the window, and climbed out, falling all the way to ground, butt naked. I proceeded to run what felt like 100 miles but was more like 3 blocks before passing out. I awoke in the morning, still naked around a few trees.
Of course I couldn’t just walk home, so I had to call my mom to come get me, and believe me it was hard to find an excuse for that.
On Tuesday I go to school (didn’t go on Monday for obvious reasons) and meet up with Clair who explains that the Seniors parents were arrested because of the whole ordeal. We also talk about what happened between me and her, and eventually we decide to get together. We dated for 10 months before breaking up."
"  college student throws party exclusively for people they dislike, hoping to mend fences. Surprisingly, guests bond and friendships form.","What Is The Most Unusual Party You’ve Ever Been To?

Back when I was in college, I threw a party exclusively for people I didn't like.
I called up ten people, and told them point-blank that I was having a party for only those people I didn't like, and they were invited.
It was my humorous way of extending an olive branch.
Most of the people laughed, and those who didn't were quite intrigued, for they didn't care for me, either.
That Friday night, I had the house decorated in gray party accessories. Gray balloons were floating at the ceiling, draped with streamers— black-and-gray, twisted and tacky— like a dreary children's party. I spent all afternoon preparing finger foods. I even found some old bouquets of daisies and plucked out most of the petals so the bud vases scattering various surfaces looked very sad. It was a funny touch given the theme of the party.
My friends helped me decorate, but didn't understand why they couldn't stay for the party.
(I liked them).
When the time came for the party I wasn't sure anyone would come, but surprisingly every single person I invited showed up! Perhaps they were curious to see where it was going, or maybe they simply wanted to share an evening in the company of like-minded people; those who shared the opinion that I was on their least-favorite person list.
At first there was tension, but as the night wore on and the drinks flowed, people started to loosen up. I found myself deep in conversation with people I had previously gone out of my way to avoid.
And also just as surprising, I found myself enjoying my guests' company!
From that night onward, there wasn't anybody in that room I wasn't on speaking terms with. We had set aside our differences and were cool with each other after that. Over the years, I even became close with a few of them. I found myself hanging out with them exclusively. As friends.
One of the party guests became such a good friend, that when I relocated out of town she drove over six hours, braving the city's rush-hour, to surprise me as I performed in a play. I saw her smiling face in the front row when the lights came up. We had dinner together after the show.
The Party For People I Didn't Like helped mend fences and open a dialogue with people who had previously made my life miserable, since these were either peers I had to work with, or who shared the same circle of friends with me.
I don't think the party would have worked if I hadn't been tactless and told them up front why they were being invited. Had I not included them in the joke, they may have been suspicious as to why they were being invited to a party with a host they didn't get along with, and simply avoided it altogether.
Like all parties, if you choose to throw a Party For People You Don't Like, it should state the reason for the event on the invitation."
  cheating on abusive boyfriend with stripper who supports her emotionally and helps her leave him. Finds love and happiness.,"I cheated on my boyfriend with the stripper he was seeing almost daily

It was the best decision I ever made. My now ex-boyfriend was emotionally and verbally mean. He’d call me derogatory names when I didn’t do something he wanted and he’d make hurtful comments about my body. I’m not even overweight but I have body dysphoria. I was crying every single day. I wanted to leave him but I couldn’t because i was emotionally dependent on him for everything and we were living together. He started going to strip clubs and being open with me about and telling me he enjoys seeing women that look better than me. He went so often that I felt like he was cheating on me. I just had to go for myself and see what it was like.
One night I went and decided to pay for a dance. It just so happens the I got a dance from one of the strippers he sees. Little did I know meeting her was going to be the best thing that ever happened to me. I was a bit drunk and tipsy so I over shared with her about my bf and told her about him. She said she knew who I was talking about because he’d always talk badly about me to the dancers. I just broke down and cried right there like a big idiot in front of her. She gave me a tissue to wipe my tears and gave me a huge hug. She said she didn’t know what my bf was talking about because she thought I was beautiful. It made me cry even more because it made my day for a girl to think I’m pretty at least.
I kept going every so often then eventually we exchanged numbers and started going out. I was so surprised to see she dressed like a boy when she wasn’t working and to learn that she was gay. She told me she doesn’t like men at all but she makes good money off of them. People really surprise me a lot. She had/has the cutest personality ever. She opens doors for me and would ask me if I was tired or if I had anything to eat. I realized I was attracted to her and she was attracted to me. This kept going on for a few months. One night she kissed me and told me to leave him and to move in with her. We had intercourse and she made me look at myself in the mirror and tell myself I’m beautiful. I thought it was time to leave him because at that point I realized I deserved better than to be emotionally, mentally and verbally harmed almost everyday by someone I used to love.
While he was at work she helped me pack up everything. I sent him a text detailing why I was leaving him. I changed my number and blocked him on everything. I live with her far away from him and haven’t heard from him in months and honestly I’m glad.
I don’t care about your opinions on my cheating on my abusive boyfriend. I have no regrets. If I never cheated on him I would’ve never found the power to leave his toxic and abusive ass and be with a girl who loves all of me and makes me feel so beautiful.
We’ve been together for six months and I’m still so in love with her. She’s still the same loving and sweet person she was when I first met her. And she’s amazing in bed, like full blown amazing. She makes me cum all the time and he hardly ever did. Maybe only once a month if I’m being honest. She works at a different strip club now and I found a new job I’m starting soon and I’m so excited for new stuff to come my way. I feel so blessed and lucky."
  girl created a Sims character resembling her future boyfriend; coincidence struck when he unknowingly dressed in a similar outfit years later.,"I created my boyfriend in The Sims years before I met him.

When I was a teenager, living in Vienna in the small country Austria, I excessively played The Sims. I created all kinds of families there with all kinds of crazy stories. Most of them were unrelated to anyone I knew, just straight out of my imagination.
As the game got developed to The Sims 4 version, the details got very much on point when it came to creating your Sims. I was always very hesitant to create myself or anyone I knew because I would feel bad of anyone dying in the game as they would portray my real life people. I also didn’t want to put anything “out there”, if you know what I mean, like attract anything bad.
With The Sims 4 though, I decided to create myself, with a different last name though, matching my Sims husband’s last name. The husband was of color as my celeb crush was 50 cent (I was 17 by the way!), was wearing a black tank top, camouflage pants, trainers and a black watch. They lived a happy life together, had kids and I made sure that they died peacefully as I did believe in attracting situation.
I met my boyfriend 2 years ago, after I moved to London. We are in a very happy relationship. One day we were at a market and it was really hot so I bought a dress so I can change into something more light and my boyfriend bought some pants in thin material, he asked if I liked them and I turned and it was some camouflage sweatpants. I said yes and we proceeded to go home (we lived a minute away) to change.
We changed our clothes and my boyfriend asked me if he looked good. I finished dressing up and looked at him to check his clothes and he was wearing a black tank top, the camouflaged sweatpants, trainers and a black watch I had just bought him as a present some weeks ago. I immediately realized he looked like my husband in The Sims I created years ago. I started laughing and told him “you look like my Sim”. He looked at me confused and as I told him what I meant he told me “oh so you attracted me into your life” with a cheeky smile and I guess he was right. Has anyone else done this?"
"  father surprised when 5-year-old son breaks character, expressing mature gratitude and desire for a peaceful connection during a walk.","My 5yo son ""broke character"" and talked to me like an adult

This happened about two years ago and I was so blown away I took notes and told my wife about it, so I still have the notes on my phone. My 5yo son was pretty typical for his age; always goofing around, never serious, always working some angle to negotiate treats or buying whatever thing was at the top of his list this week. Kids have a selfish worldview and that's mostly understandable because they haven't matured yet. So when my son asked me to go for a walk just the two of us, I immediately laughed and thought ""ok, what's he going to ask for"".
We start walking and I ask ""what's on your mind buddy?"". He said ""nothing really, I just want to have some time to be with you and be peaceful and be out in nature"". Wow ok, this is progress I thought. Then he said ""I want you to know you're the best Dad I've ever had. You really do help me and my sister a lot and you're really very nice, even though we don't usually tell you. So I just wanted to say 'thank you for everything' and that I want to be near you always."" By this point, the only reason I wasn't completely crying my eyes out is that I thought it was some kind of a joke or lead up to ask for something, this was totally out of character especially at this age. I managed to croak out something like ""I'm really glad to hear that and I love you very much"". Then we just enjoyed the rest of the walk.
It really felt like for a moment I was speaking to a soul who has had several lives (""you're the best dad I've ever had"") and wanted to speak directly to me instead of play the role of a child. I'm so glad it happened and it's something I will never forget. Later he went right back to being the same old goofy kid that I love."
  unexpected lesson from zaza plug (drug dealer) changes narrator's perspective on life: focusing on the big picture and conserving energy.,"My zaza plug taught me a lesson that changed my entire outlook on life

So I’ve been buying off of this guy for a few years or whatever, but I honestly never really took the time to talk to him or get to know him. It’s really funny honestly because he’s this big kinda gangster dude, and I’m just this little white kid who has NO sort of context on what sort of life he is living but alas, our paths have connected.
The other day it was POURING rain but I was already out and wanted to get stuff from him so I hit him up and he told me to come to his place like normal. I get there and usually he will run down or sometimes have me come to his door and this time I guess because of the rain he told me to come to the door. I get to the door and he just tells me to come in. The first time I had been inside his place and I honestly felt honored that he trusted me enough to be inside.
We just started talking and then eventually this little baby girl walks out and it’s his daughter he introduces me and she’s really sweet only like maybe 5 or so. He tells me basically that her mom left them and he’s been a single dad for years and he does what he does so that he can be with his daughter at all times when she needs him because he had no one else, the rest of his immediate family has passed away and all in tragic ways, my heart started to just feel heavy thinking about that like how one person can deal with all of that.
I take my life so for granted I’ve always had everything handed to me. Then when minor things happen to me I make a big deal out of it and here is someone who has gone through real tough shit and is standing ten toes strong. So I asked him how he deals with so much on his plate or manages many things at once.
He stopped and thought for a second and then he picked up a neon green lighter that was sitting on the table and he put it real close to my eyes horizontally so that it was blocking my vision and he says “What do you see” and I told him I see green (the color of the lighter) and he said “Right but what objects do you see clearly” and I just said nothing then he pulled the lighter back next to his face and said now what do you see and I was confused but I said “I see the lighter?” And he said exactly and that if you try to over analyze things and look at them too closely then you will be lost trying to make sense of things/‘d the best way to handle things is to look at the big picture and see what you’re working with and how it can work for you. Never give any one thing too much of your energy whether it’s positive or negative."
  narrator's secret stash of adult toys and substances almost exposed when wife ventures into the basement but remains undetected.,"How Did All Your Secrets Almost Ruin Your Life?

I'm a married man with young kids. I live a boring life, office job, don't smoke or do substances, normally. But I have one secret. When my wife and kids are away for the weekend I take xtc. I watch adult videos for hours on end and do backdoor stuff on myself silly. Got a bunch of rose toys and backdoor lightsabers, pants with holes at the crotch and uranus, various fake flashlights, cigarettes and a small bag with a bunch of pills, all stuffed away in a big shoppingbag in our basement. It's in a far corner, just behind some personal stuff and old skiwear I no longer use.
It's safe there because my wife is scared of the shaky steep stairs and in general scared of the basement (dark, spooky). Went there once or twice and was like ""nope, you have to get things from me there I ain't going there"". And if she needs something she always asks me.
So this weekend I'm out of town and I get a text: ""why do you keep that old skisuit? You don't use it and it's old"" My heart starts pounding like crazy: why is she in the basement? And apparently she's in that very corner? I say ""yeah, well maybe one day again.. wow you're in the basement!?"" Her: ""yeah I needed a thing and once here it wasn't so bad and now I want to sort some of this trash out"". Heart rate increases but I don't know anything I could do from here, far away, and saying ""don't do that"" would be super suspicious. So I just answer that I applaud her bravery and that I was going to clean as well (implying she doesn't need to do this).
I didn't get another message so I figured she didn't find it. Because she would definitely call me right away if she even just found a dildo, nevermind everything else I had there.
When I come home all seems normal and as soon as I can I check in the basement and see the skiwear bag on the same place. Behind it my bag full of self intercourse and substance stuff, untouched."
"  dreaming of comforting their mother in a dark house mirrors a real event, forever altering their understanding.","Who Did You Meet That Forever Changed Your Life?

Let me begin by saying i was born in 1998. So this is by far the weirdest experience I've had. Anyway I'm not much of a dreamer, but when i do dream it's usually very lucid and memorable. So i had a dream that my mother was alone in an old really poor looking house with my newborn sister and was waiting for my dad to get home. It was dark out and my mother was anxious waiting at the door hoping my father would show up. The house was a one room structure with only 4 or 5 candles illuminating it. I was casually talking to my mother saying it's all okay and just reassuring her that everything is okay. Suddenly my mother looked at me and was thanking me for being with her while she was alone and for protecting her. Then next thing i know i wake up. I thought it was an odd dream but didn't think much of it after i showered and went to work.
Fast forward 3 days it's a Friday night and my parents and i are outside in my front yard sitting around a fire talking. And my parents began to joke about how my mother used to pop my father's bike tires when they lived in Mexico. (My parents are Mexican and came to the U.S in '95).
I ask what's the story behind that, and they begin to explain to me that back when my sister was born in 1991, they lived in an old shack in a poor part of a small town in Mexico for a year. My father had the habit of going out on his bike with friends to drink and not coming home until the next morning so my mother would pop the tires on his bike so he wouldn't leave. I laughed and didn't think much else until they continued on about it.
My mother said she'd be terrified of being home alone in the tiny home because they lived in an alley known as ""El callejon de la Llorona"" which translates to (Alley of the weeping woman). For those unfamiliar the weeping woman is an urban legend in Mexico about a ghost woman who roams areas of Mexico and even parts of the U.S weeping for he missing kids, so naturally an alley named after the ghost is going to be terrifying as hell
My mother continued on saying how terrified she was in that house alone and would wait praying for mt father to come home. My father then made a joke saying something along the lines of ""Why did you want me there you claimed your guardian angel was protecting you.""
At this point i thought, ""ok what the hell."" So i asked my mom more and she told me that she one night was visited by a man who seemingly came out of the wall, but she felt comfort and familiarity around him. He sat and spoke to her reassuring her it's okay before the man seemingly walked back into the wall. My mother said that after this she felt a strong calmness around and was no longer afraid of being there."
"  man distrusts his pregnant girlfriend due to paranoia, catches her cheating, and reacts impulsively by kicking her out, causing remorse.","I Kicked my Pregnant Girlfriend out of the House

So I 27M have been together with my Girlfriend 26F for almost 8 years, our relationship was kinda rocky since I usually have to go on business trip’s to different countries once in awhile, and she’s admitted she hates it since she’s paranoid that I might be cheating on her, she’s gotten cheated before in the past. I of course, reassured many times that I wasn’t. Even to the point I was not drinking while on my trips, trying my best to avoid other female interaction, even calling, texting her anytime I was Immediately free to text. She’s also pregnant which I assume made her paranoia worse, sometimes I’d even wake up to her calling me crying on the phone cause I didn’t answer her texts within a minute. I still once again, done everything to clear her suspicions about me which made me kinda depressed knowing that she doesn’t trust me fully enough. Last Week Tuesday, I came back home early from my trip to surprise her even buying big patch of flowers and tickets to a movie she’d been dying to seen for a couple months as well as buying her a ring since I’ve been wanting to pop the question for awhile now. When I arrived back home I saw a car that I wasn’t familiar with parked in the driveway, I assumed it was her friend’s car since one of them got her license 9 months ago. As I opened the door to the house I heard music blasting from our bedroom, I thought this was a bit strange since she doesn’t like loud noise.
As I came upstairs and entered the bedroom, I saw something I thought i’d never seen in a million years. My girlfriend riding some guy that i’d never seen before in my life, I’m not gonna go into details about what I done but the guy ended up leaving the house after 15 or 20 minutes. Afterwards me and my girlfriend had a shouting match, she was accusing me of all sorts of things like how I was never around much, I rarely took her on dates anymore and that I was probably cheating on her while on my business trips. Which is a f ing lie considering I’ve always took her out somewhere when I came back from work even when I was tired as shit, and her accusing me of cheating was a f ing lie because I always showed her that I wasn’t, even gave her all my social medias password because I f ing loved her.
I don’t know why but I just snapped, I packed all her belongings and threw them out into the cold rainy street where she started screaming at me even more for doing that, my head was hurting from the amount of anger that built up and her screaming in my ear didn’t help. Now I don’t condone what I did and I of course regret it, but I just grabbed her and threw her out into the street where I screamed at her to not come back because the locks would be changed. I slammed the door and called off work for 2 weeks due to a family emergency.
All week I’ve just done nothing but drink myself to sleep because I’m just so heartbroken."
"  teen's crush turns out to be someone else, causing confusion and embarrassment before a surprising encounter.","How Did Everything Go Wrong With Your Crush?

When I was 16 I took an SAT prep class to improve my score and get into a good college. The class was pretty boring, but I met the most interesting girl in the class. She was thin, fairly short, with light brown hair and green eyes. She always wore a green headband which I thought was cute. Her name was Connie. We hit it off immediately and spent most of the class whispering to each side by side at our desks. I spent about 3 weeks sitting next to her talking during the class. When the class was over we exchanged IM handles so we could keep in touch (this was in the early 2000’s).
About a year passed and we continued talking online. We got to know each other pretty well but we lived on completely different sides of the city and it was quite a drive to visit each other so being the young teens we were we never actually got together. Eventually I worked up the courage to ask her out for dinner. I set our date at a restaurant located between the both of us so we wouldn’t have to drive too far.
The time for our date rolled around and I headed to the restaurant to meet her. I walked in and saw her sitting in a booth with two older individuals at the far side of the establishment. She looked exactly like she did in the class, thin, light brown hair, green eyes and she was wearing her signature green headband. I approached her and said hello… I gave her a hug and sat down next to her in the booth. I assumed these two older indiviudals across from us were her parents… odd I thought, but maybe they were there to chaperone.
I could tell immediately something was wrong.
The two older individuals looked very confused, surprised, almost bewildered. The look on Connie’s face was also one of perplexity. Eventually she said… “who are you?”
I was shocked— I said, “uhhhh… I’m Jason… remember we setup a date for tonight? I assume these are your parents, it is very nice to meet you.” And I reached out my hand to shake her parents hands.
They didn’t return my handshake. Instead they simply looked at their daughter and said “oh, did you forget to tell us this Sara?”
“Sara?” I said. “You told me your name was Connie?”
She looked absolutely puzzled and said, “sorry you must have me confused with someone else.”
“Oh… uhhh… hmmm…my mistake…” I replied. Then scratched my head and headed out of the restaurant to my car. I was embarrassed. Maybe she just didn’t want to go out with me I thought. She could have at least just said no instead of leading me on this charade.
Defeated and humiliated I decided to just head home. When I opened the door to my car I heard a voice behind me say “hey Jason!” I turned around. It was a tall, light blonde haired woman with a large round face and blue eyes. “Uhh do I know you?” I said. “It’s me Connie… we had a date planned remember? Where are you going?” she said.
We went inside and had dinner. She was definitely Connie, she remembered all our previous conversations over the past year, but she looked nothing like the girl I met in class. When I asked her why she stopped wearing her green headband, she had no recollection of ever wearing or even owning this type of headband."
"  post-nut clarity: After orgasm, guys experience reduced interest in sex and a shift in perspective and priorities.","Guys of TikTok, is ""post nut clarity"" a real thing? What is it like?

Yeah, totally real. After guys nut their interest in sx drops to near zero. Consider that for a minute. They simply cannot be turned on, it's over for them. They don't care, their mind is giving no positive feedback anymore to erotic ideas or imagery. It's the difference of being hungry then being so full the idea of eating more makes you a little disgusted. Post nut clarity is a brief time when guys see the world devoid of their intercoursel interest, and it can be a bit weird. You realize that a lot of what you were doing prior to nutting was just to reach that point and you go ""why did I do that? How was this worth it?"".
Thing is, most of the time a guy's desire for intercouse overrides a lot of other stuff. When guys are horny they'll say anything for intercourse, and probably mean it too, but their minds are clouded by the idea of intercourse, and after intercourse they can see the thing for what it is without intercourse and realize it's not that great. Like, a guy will wine and dine you and tell you he wants to spend the whole week with you, and in that moment he's not really lying, but that can all come crashing down once he nuts and realizes all he really wanted was intercourse and the idea of giving up his weekend for you person doesn't seem so desirable anymore."
"  a gullible child believed in a Care Bear mailbox that communicated with Care-a-lot, only discovering the truth years later.","What is the stupidest thing you were tricked into believing?

My mom convinced me of a lot of magical bullshit as a child, but the worst one was the Care Bears.
We had a regular mailbox at the end of our driveway, but we also had this metal mailbox attached to our house. I asked what it was for. ""Oh, that's the Care Bear mailbox,"" my mom said. ""It sends letters directly to Care-a-lot."" Sure enough, I wrote them a letter (I fucking loved the Care Bears) and the next morning, there was a response from the Care Bears written in huge chalk rainbow cursive on our driveway.
I was hooked. My little gullible mind thought it was so logical, and when I realized the handwriting looked nothing like any other handwriting I'd ever seen in my 7 years, I knew it must be real. I wrote them letters all summer. As winter approached, one morning, the Care Bear mailbox had a small colorful card inside it. It was from the Care-a-lot Post Office. It informed me that postal service was ending for the season, and to be sure to write again next summer!
Fast-forward to a year or two later. I'm new at school, and I go to a birthday party at a classmate's house. She has a mailbox attached to the side of her house. ""Oh!"" I exclaim, ""you have a Care Bears mailbox, too!""
Blank stares. I chuckle to myself, thinking these poor girls, they have no idea. ""The Care Bears mailbox,"" I explain in a patronizing tone. ""It's a direct line to Care-a-lot."" Peals of laughter. Then they realize I'm not joking, and I'm not laughing. They inform me it's just an old mailbox, that it was for regular mail before they put the post-style boxes at the end of the driveways.
""Maybe for your house,"" I say confidently. ""Not at my house."" The topic is dropped, whispers are exchanged about how weird I am, and I truly think that these poor girls are being deprived of Care Bear correspondence because they are unwilling to believe.
I believed in that fucking mailbox all the way until I was almost fifteen. When I found out Santa wasn't real (shut up) and neither were the Smurfs (another embarrassing story). Heartbreaking."
"  waste recycling center accident launches V8 engine, causing car crash and leaving driver paralyzed. Disturbing incident for garbage men.","Garbage men, what is the most disturbing thing you've ever seen thrown away?

I have family that works at a plant waste recycling centre and often help out
Now what we found isnt disturbing but what it did was disturbing
So at this place we have these gigantic grinders, designed for shredding trees, piles of pallets, really anything wood so it can be turned to mulch. Now metal does go through these things but its usually small, things like brackets, bolts, screws and nails, and on the conveyer out of the grinder there is a magnet to pull it out. If anything too big for the grinder to handle will just jam the grinder.
For context the size of each grinder is around the size of a semi truck trailer, in fact many of them are built into trailers for easy transport, except The Tub. The Tub takes a minimum of 4 semi trailers to transport and with all its accessories (in built mulch storage, spare parts, collection hopper, ground level loader) takes up 9, and these are your large 4 axle low load semi truck trailers.
One time we had the tub operating, chewing through this pile that we wanted gone, and it was always growing as it was council cleanup week so, next door is the solid waste center, we had a situation where a truck had come along and dumped its waste in the wrong area, so we had a bunch of non plant waste to clear up all while more trucks kept arriving, we thought we had gotten everything.
Skip to around 4 hours later, front loader is about to dump a load into the tub, right as the load drops thats when someone points it out, an almost complete V8 engine ended up getting dropped into the tub, you hear a horrible grinding and heaps of yelling, then you hear The Tub jam up, this is the first time ever that The Tub has jammed, and before you know it, you hear a metallic chime, and the massive lump of metal that was a V8 engine gets thrown into the air, everybody panics, you see workers running to hide in buildings, the evacuation alarm starts blaring, i dont even know what i tried to do, but whatever it was, i was in the open the whole time, nobody saw where it went, we all assumed it went in the bushland surrounding the site and was lost, that is till we hears sirens of emergency vehicles coming from all around, i get in my car and drive towards the sirens, what ended up happening was the engine flew over to a highway around 1/2 a kilometer away, landed on top of a car that was driving and caused a multi vehicle accident, suprisingly no deaths, but the person who was in the car that the engine landed on is now a paraplegic"
"  a divorced redditor's final straw: witnessing a couple's sweet interaction at a tech store, realizing their partner lacked that connection.","Divorced men and women of reddit, what was the final straw?

My divorce was death by a thousand paper cuts. The final straw was something a little different.
I wanted to go to my local micro center and browse the afternoon away. She decided to go with me and sit in the car. As I’m wandering at the glory that is tech, I’m in the BYOPC department looking at a motherboard. This couple in their 20s walks up to the CPU case and the guy lays down this nerd stream about the latest AMD processor. She’s listening, let’s him finish his overview of thread counts and proceeds to bust his balls about it. But it was so sweet. So caring. It was the cutest thing I’d ever seen. She didn’t understand but she loved him. And loved what a giant dork he was.
It was in that moment I realized that I would never have that with the person I’m with and even if I could find a way to get there with her I don’t want it. I had struggled for a few years with all the excuses of not getting out. Oddly enough that exchange between strangers was what did it for me."
"  person exploited overpriced school vending machines, forming a lucrative candy and soda business with friends, but faced legal consequences.","How Did You Secretly Hustle To Make Money In School?

I dealt in candy and soda. The vending machines at my middle school were ridiculously overpriced, because every penny above a certain $ amount would go back to the school. So for example, if a can of pop was usually $1 in the machine, the school would charge $1.50 and get to keep the $0.50. Instead of doing the less greedy thing and making it barely noticeable (like $0.20 more per unit) they decided they didn't want kids eating candy at school anyways - so they sky rocketed prices. $2.50 for a can of pop, $3 for a candy bar, etc.
So I beat the system. I'd go to the dollar store with my mum, where candy bars were like $0.60 each and buy boxes at a time. I also bought flats (24) of soda which ended up costing about $0.50 a unit. At first I wanted to do it all myself, so I sold them for $1.50 each, essentially doubling my money after I paid taxes on the product being purchased. It was great for a bit, but it started to grow too large, and a little bit out of control. This school had grades 7 to 9 in it, and was from a rural area, so basically every kid went to the same school. There was probably 500 kids between the 3 grades.
In the end, I basically made a mob, lol. Instead of selling the candy and pop for $1.50 each, I contracted my friends from my small village to help me out. I sold them the candy and pop in bulk for $1.00 a piece, and told them they could do whatever they wanted with the candy. I'd sell them 10 units for their lunch money, then most of them would sell that all at $1.50 a piece, use the $10 for their lunch, and have $5 to buy more candy and soda from me.
I was probably profiting close to $50 a day at the end. It was very impressive. Until the police showed up and the school called a massive assembly. Apparently selling candy and pop without some kind of license/permit is illegal where I live. On top of that, they said, out loud, during the assembly, that whoever was in charge of the scheme essentially created an illicit gang and that legal consequences would follow if it wasn't stopped by the following Monday. They also sent out a letter to every parent including the details. No names were mentioned.
Thanks to my strong bond and the blood like relationships with the boys I grew up with, we all agree to end it and keep our mouths shut. "
"  resourceful PhD candidate ingeniously cheated on a language requirement by memorizing specific book pages, impressing the professor and obtaining a degree.","What is the most genius way to cheat on a exam you have ever seen?

My brilliant uncle was a PhD candidate in the 70's at a pretty prestigious institution in the US. Well back in the day, to graduate with a PhD in his field of study (engineering), you had to demonstrate your mastery of a foreign language other than English. And by foreign language, only French, German and Spanish counted. Even though my Uncle was born abroad and was fluent in other languages, the administration refused to let him pass the foreign language requirement without mastery of one of the above languages.
Upon inquiring on what it would take to pass out of the language requirement, he was told that it would be based on comprehension of one of these (Spanish, French or German) books where a random page would be selected by the faculty for the student to translate.
He promptly selected the French hardcover book, took it to his girlfriend at the time and cracked open that book to pages 165/166. With his girlfriend's translation, he memorized the contents of those pages.
The next day, he opened that book to page 165, creased the spine and closed it. He repeated that same action the day after. Again he did the same the next day. And the day after that. And so on for the next year until it was time to demonstrate his mastery of the French language. Stepping into the professors office, he handed over the book and the professor flipped open the book to a random page.
The professor handed over the book back to my uncle. Looking down, my uncle saw pages 165/166, cracked a little smile and walked away with his PhD just a month later."
"  a former mentor in the nursing field revealed a dark side, manipulating colleagues, spreading false rumors, and sabotaging careers.","When have you met someone who was pure evil?

My mentor.
This was a woman that trained me early on in my nursing career. She helped me get my first job. She was the charge nurse and everyone loved her. She was laid back, fun, and an excellent nurse. Really brilliant. But the closer I got to her, the more evil I saw.
It started out with simple things. For example, she didn't like this new nurse on our unit. So she told the rest of us not to trust the new nurse. That the new nurse was a snitch. The new nurse was sleeping with one of the doctors. The new nurse was writing people up. My mentor kept this up until no one was talking to the new nurse. She was completely isolated. I ended up getting to know the new nurse well and none of that was true. But still, I didn't think badly of my mentor. I thought she was just ill informed.
I really didn't think my mentor was evil, until she turned on me. All of a sudden people stopped talking to me. My manager was on my back for things I hadn't done. Rumors were flying right and left. Finally I got someone to open up about why everyone was avoiding me. What I was told was, “(Your mentor) told us not to talk to you anymore. She said that you were bad news and that you're going to be fired and we would be guilty by association.” I was floored! I had nothing on my record that would warrant being fired! Quite the opposite actually! I had letters from patients and nurses thanking me for my work. I had never once been written up!
I went to my manager. She confirmed what I'd heard. She said “keep your head down and do your work.” and maybe, just maybe I could keep my job. I met with HR. I met with the VP of nursing. I met with the director of nursing. They all told me the same thing, my mentor had been steadily listing complaints against me. Nothing official. There was nothing in writing. But she had been mentioning my name to them and not in a good light.
How do I know my mentor was behind this? How do I know I wasn't just being paranoid? I left that job on my own. It was so bad, I couldn't stay. Weeks after I left, my mentor told another nurse, in front of my friends, “Sometimes this job bores the hell out of me. So you know what I do to make it fun? I mess with people. I try to see how far I can take it until they break.”
She's a true sociopath. An evil sociopath."

He started hearing voices. We've been together since we were 11. We've experienced everything together. I love and accept everything about him.
Shortly after moving in with each other, he broke down. He told me that he can't stand hearing voices anymore. I helped him see a doctor about it. They evaluated him and diagnosed him with ""stress."" In his words, he's pretty f ing stressed about hearing voices.
After awhile, he starts admitting to me that he's terrified of mirrors. Why? Because the people on the inside will take him away. We go back to the doctor. Again, they tell him ""you don't want to be diagnosed with something bad."" It's just stress.
Nothing left to do than keep bringing him back until they believe him. Doesn't help that now he's convinced the doctors don't want him to get help. Can't really blame him for that.
It was hard to adapt at first. I would never have pictured him to have been going through such internal pain. The one thing that stood out to me, he had spent so many years building my mental health up and doing anything he could to bring me out of depression. I had been so selfish for so long. How could I have not realized something was wrong? I was supposed to be the one person who knew him the most.

After he arrived, the girl asked me to meet-up but I told her I had a friend in town and it would have to wait. Surprisingly, she replied ""how about I come take care of both of you?""
Neither my buddy or I had ever once had a threesome. We took a step back and in a moment of clairvoyance both agreed ""Fuck it, we're in our early 20's, let's invite this girl over and it'll be a fun memory for later.""

While we waited, we made the bed and cleaned the place up but then we thought ""Shit, we've never seen each other's meat before (let alone any other meat in person) and we're about to have the devil's threesome.

I was in love like that once. We all do stupid things in the name of love. Try to learn from this. It may seem like the world is ending but it’s not.

  a partner's unusual request for drawing on her back with a marker turned out to be a fetish for rough bathing.,"What is the most bizarre sexual request you have ever received in a relationship?

A young woman once asked me to draw pictures on her naked back with a permanent marker. I've never been much of an artist, but I gave it a try nonetheless and about halfway through my first attempt, the girl started moaning and writhing beneath me in a way that seemed really, really exaggerated. Although I did my best to focus on my task, the motions of my partner made it rather difficult.
""Do you want me to keep doing this?"" I asked her.
""Yes! Yes!"" came the young woman's reply. ""Yes, don't stop! Draw all over me!""
Again, the whole thing seemed more like a performance than it did an actual response to pleasure, and I started to get suspicious that I was being made the butt of some bizarre joke. Every line that I drew sent the girl into paroxysms of affected delight, until she finally moaned for me to put away the marker and get out my ""paint-sprayer."" The rest of the evening eventually went on about as you'd expect from such encounters, despite a tiny voice in the back of my head asking what I'd missed about the whole situation.
I finally got my answer when the girl asked to take a shower with me.
It turned out that what she'd really wanted was for me to scrub her skin until it was practically raw. We wound up having an informative discussion after I'd washed the remnants of my drawing off her, and it came to light that she'd always liked the feeling of being roughly bathed. When I asked why she hadn't simply requested that in the first place, she sheepishly admitted that having a fetish for emulating an easel seemed less bizarre to her. If anyone can, please explain why someone would enjoy this."
  woman announces to strict family she will no longer wear hijab after 12 years; finds unexpected support from her mother.,"Tomorrow I will be telling my strict family that after 12 years of wearing hijab I will no longer be wearing it

Before I start please don't leave any islamophobic remarks under here I am a 24F who started wearing hijab at a very young age. The reason I wore it was very manipulative, i was in a very strict islamic middle school where teachers would stop me in the hallways and tell me how my friends will go to heaven while I burn in hell in eternity. Everyone around me wore it so as any 11 year old in my situation would, I went and told my famiy that I would like to start wearing it as soon as i turned
12. They let me and i started wearing it as soon as i turned 12. I ended up changing middle schools a year after and to my surprise almost none of the girls in my class wore it and i felt stuck. Living in an islamic country, taking it off is so much worse than never putting it on. I suppressed my dislike to hijab, it robbed me from so many things growing up. I felt so ugly in it, people made so many assumptions about me, im generally quiet so people would assume i am conservative, no guys would ever approach me because of these assumptions unlike they would to my friends which damaged me alot. I fully respect the hijab and women who are strong enough to wear it. Props to them, I wish I was like that. I have met everyone currently in my life as a hijabi, everyone kind of has that image of me now. As a hijabi, people especially men would find the excuse to tell you to cover up and comment on your clothes so frequently because of what you're representing much more than they would any other girl. My parents specifically my dad would generally give me body checks everytime I leave my house to make sure i am covered. They would fix my clothes in public without my consent which would make people look at me weird and makes me feel so violated. People always found an excuse to touch my chest area or neck to cover it without asking me. When travelling, people assume I'm oppressed, a terrorist, an ignorant person. I feel so discriminated with it. All in all, I had a horrible experience with hijab. I am terrified of all the judgement I will face. I feel frozen and I almost dont want to take it off because of the backlash i will recieve. Tomorrow, i will be telling my family because i have finally had enough and I have no idea how they will react. I dont know if my reasons are good enough, i dont know if i will deal with abuse. They will worry about their reputation because in arab families, the women represent the ""honor"" of the family. I dont have support from anyone, I am so scared. I am scared I will lose some of my friends, I am scared to deal with hate speech. I hate how a piece of clothing means so much to people and I hate how I had to wear it for 12 years because I was so scared of this exact backlash, except if i had done it back then I would have been excused as a teenager. Right now I'm a full grown adult. I am posting this here for support, please show me any support if you can. Please dont leave any hate or islamophobic speech, I am already traumatized from religion. It will only damage me and it won't change the situation.
If you stuck around here’s the update,
I have spoken to my mom and cried my eyes out to her, to my surprise she was very understanding and supportive. She has my back and I havent been able to stop crying since, I feel so free. Thank you to everyone who has sent me their support, you have all given me the strength to have this conversation with her She said I dont have to worry about explaining to my dad as she will do it for me. I am so blessed and grateful. Thank you so much for the support, this has been so surreal."
"  how Carrie White, a bullied and telekinetic teenager, seeks revenge at prom, but ultimately dies after being stabbed by her mother.","What Horror Movie Has The Absolute Worst Ending?

We see the protagonist, Carrie White, turn into a ""villain""
Carrie is relentlessly bullied and mocked in school by her peers (this has gone on her entire life) and this treatment doesn't let up at home.
Margaret White, Carrie's mother, is a religious fanatic rendering her cruel and delusional. We are trusted into Carrie's world and you can't help but feel bad. You also have a need to root for her.
She's also telekinetic. I failed to mention that.
Carrie finally has enough at the Senior Prom. After a terrible prank embarrasses her in front of the entire senior class....she snaps. In her pain and rage, she lets her power take over and she gets her revenge.
She kills most, if not all of her classmates and in the book, she practically destroys her small town.
She gets home and is attacked and subsequently stabbed by her own mother. Being telekinetic, according to Margaret, is akin to being a Witch and therefore evil. In self defense, Carrie ends mother. Carrie is mortally wounded and she dies from her injuries.
I saw the film before I read the book. I was very young and I just remember wanting to cry. I asked my mother why did she have to die.
I, of course, understood it better as I got older. It goes along with you've done too much to go on. There is always a price.
Fast forward it over three decades later, my daughter had the same reaction I did. She didn't understand it, and like me, she cried.
This ending still gets to me."

I wasn't going to answer this. However, I feel I owe it to those who have supported me. I also want to explain to others that I just did not hurt someone out of revenge or hate. I am hoping this will give a better picture to everyone
My 14-year-old brother was being abused by a 22-year-old distant relative. This was every abuse including threats of death by glocks.
I told my parents; they did not believe me. I told a retired cop friend. He just turned around and told my parents. I was out of options.
So, during deer season, I looked for him. I finally found him and walked up to him with tears in my eyes and asked him why he wanted to hurt my brother. He asked why I was crying like a baby. He laughed and asked if it was because my parents didn't believe me. He then told me that my parents told him, which I already knew.
Then, with a chuckle, he said that maybe he should come down from the deer stand and give me the same treatment. I told him he would never hurt my brother again and raised my glock and shot.
I dropped the gun and fell to my knees and cried and cried. It got to where I couldn't cry. It was getting dark so I finally got up and staggered home.
That was what it was like for me. I never want to go through that again."
  a teenager shares a story of severe abuse at home and recounts the disbelief and unsupportive attitude of their therapist.,"Therapists of reddit, what was your biggest ""I know I'm not supposed to judge you but holy sh*t"" moment?

When i was a teenager, i lived in a very emotionally and mentally abusive household. I know people don't take that stuff seriously, but it was so bad that i was later diagnosed with PTSD from a psychiatrist. Anywho, my abusive parents and i got in a verbal fight in the car. My stepdad stopped the car and told me ""get out we're leaving you on the highway"". I wasn't scared because i knew i could just call the police, say i was an abandoned child, and theyd get in loads of trouble, so i said ""sounds good"" and got out. My mom then came out and started attacking me. I refused to get back in the car after the attack, so my stepdad got out, dragged me by the hair, called me a ""bipolar beach"", and threw me in. They made me see a therapist, they told her that i jumped out of a moving car and then i attacked my mom when she was trying to help. This therapist didn't believe anything i said and tried getting me to take bipolar meds. I knew i wasn't bipolar, i was being abused and i knew that the anger and sadness i felt was normal for my situation. She glared at me and said ""you're not nearly as smart as you think you are"". I refused to say a word in any of our therapy sessions after that, i would just go in, sit down, and she'd make snarky sarcastic remarks for a few minutes then dismiss me. She wasn't trying to help me, she was trying to help my parents. I moved out when i was 18, went to college all on my own with no financial help from my family, got a job and left the country to be as far from them as possible. I'm on antidepressants for my PTSD and luckily the therapists ive had since my teenage years have been nothing like that horrible woman, but it still upsets me deeply thinking about it."
"  past ex-fiancé seeks meeting for closure, evoking mixed emotions in author who ultimately forgives but prefers no future contact.




","Ex fiance wants to meet up after leaving me at the alter four years ago.

Basically four years ago, I was supposed to be getting married to my fiance at the time, J. Everything was going perfect, I was in my dress, had my make up on and taken pictures with my bridesmaids. I was pretty much ready to walk down the aisle when J's best man pulled me to side and said J was gone. He had gotten into a car and left and no one was able to get a hold of him.
I came home to our apartment and all his stuff was gone. He's been pretty much a ghost ever since he left me and I had to force myself to move on. I ended up going on our honeymoon with my best friends (which was the best decision ever) and then put myself in therapy to heal the horrible trust issues I now have. I haven't heard from him once until today.
I guess he got back in contact with an old mutual friend, who gave him my number. J texted me and said wants to meet up and apologize. He says he has a lot to explain to me about what happened that day. I'm torn. I swore J was a dead memory but my curiosity and desire to get closure with him is pestering me. My current boyfriend supports me whatever I decide and I feel out of respect to him and how wonderful he's been
So I did meet up with J. it was part of a 12 step program and he was making amends. We met up at a park and my boyfriend came with me. He sat off to the side while J and I talked.
I actually feel stupider after meeting with him. There were a lot of things in our relationship that would of had me out the door if I paid more attention and if he wasn't such a great liar.
Basically for the last year of our relationship, he was doing substances and cheating on me. He had been struggling with his sexuality for years and it's not surprising it ended up this way now knowing the truth. His family are incredibly homophobic and horrible people. I wanted nothing to do with them when we were together but he insisted on them being around just for the big life events, like our wedding.
The drugs were something to get him through the day and act like he was in love with me when he was actually in love with someone else. He had met his boyfriend at work and I had actually met him a few times when I'd drop off lunch for J.
When our wedding approached, his boyfriend said he needed to choose and J chose him. So he packed his bags up and pretended everything was great until his boyfriend picked him up and they moved two towns over.
I asked him if he was still with his boyfriend and he said no. He thought he could quit the substances once he was free of his family and lying but he couldn't. His boyfriend found out and left him. He kept going, getting high and hooking up with randoms. One of his regular hook ups ended up overdosing while they were asleep in the same bed and died and he realized he had to get sober.
He apologized for not just being honest with me and leading me on like he did. He wished he could go back and be truthful because I would have been the most accepting of him being gay out of everyone. He said he missed me when he left because even though he didn't love me romantically, I was his best friend.
It was a lot to take in. I told him while I'm glad he's okay and is doing better, I'd prefer for us not to have any contact moving forward but I do forgive him. He said he understood and he was only in town for a few more days and he'd be gone for good again.
I'll admit when I got home, I cried. My boyfriend held me and ordered me my favorite take out. He's been really the best and didn't pressure me to talk about anything until I was ready. So if I got anything out of the worst day of my life, it's led me to who I'm with now."
"  friend accidentally broke MacBook, offered to pay for repair, but owner demands extra for upgrade. Court rules 50% repair cost.","Sat down on my friend's MacBook and broke it, offered to pay her the money for it but now she wants more because ""she was upgrading anyway"" so it's this or she will sue me in small claims court.

I had some of my friends over at my house and one of my friends invited one of her other friends to come over. She had her MacBook on my couch when I sat on it and broke it. Since it was completely my fault I offered to pay her the money for it and she agreed. She got it 3 years ago and it cost 2200 dollars at the time. I told her I'd wire you the money in a week to her bank account.
She's now emailed me saying that as per our conversation she's expecting the 2700 that I have agreed for! I didn't know why she added the extra money so I got her number from my friend and called her to find her telling me she's now expecting me to pay for her new upgraded MacBook since she was ""upgrading anyway"". She said if I don't agree to do that she'll be suing me in small claims court. Can a judge agree to that?
I got served a few days later and went to court. I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (I printed out the email I sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a beach and saying we’ll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I’d give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. I tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.
She gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case I guess. After listening to both of us he ruled that I pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. "

He left a letter telling me he planned this for some time now and that he had enough money for me to go to college but that if he underwent treatment, he wouldn't have enough money left.
Before he killed himself, we talked about my future and I told him that I'll do as many part time jobs as I can and take out a loan if I have to. But in his letter he said that he knew it wouldn't be enough and that he didn't want me to go into debt. He left me everything in his will. He said that if he was alive I'd insist on using that money for his treatment.
It's been a year now and I'm still living in the same house, typing this from the same chair where I found him. I still don't know how to live with myself. I have no one now.

  friends on shrooms follow a dog that mysteriously appears and leads them across town to their destination. Trippy adventure unfolds.,"What was your craziest trip on shrooms?

Growing up in my hometown there wasn't much for teenagers to do so naturally my friends and I got most of our kicks from substance and partying. One night my buddy and I had bought an 8th of mushrooms and decided we were gonna eat them and walk from my end of town to his girlfriends house which was about a 3 hour walk. We had nothing better to do that night and thought screw it, at least we'll have some fun tripping out. We ate the shrooms after we got something to drink at Sonic and decided to order two cheeseburgers to carry with us in case we got the munchies later. So we started our adventure slowly taking our time walking around town and ended up in this small park. It's around 10 p.m. or so and we decide to stop and smoke a few bowls since we were starting to feel the shrooms kick in. By the time we finished our second bowl we were definitely well under the effects of everything and having a good time. This is where things started to get weird. We were sitting there laughing when this black dog walks up out of f ing nowhere and sits down next to us. Naturally we pet it and it's super friendly with us so we decide that we should give him our cheeseburgers because he seems so cool. We unwrap the food and give it to him and he's ecstatic about it at this point. Once he finishes the burgers he slowly starts to walk away and my buddy suggests that we should just follow the dog and see where it takes us. Being under the influence like I was, this seemed like an awesome idea and we began following this dog around, completely forgetting his girlfriend was waiting for us to come over. After about 4-5 hours of following this dog around with the occasional stops to stare at the patterns on the sidewalk or just lay down in the grass, we end up on the side of town known as seventh street. This is the neighborhood which my buddy's girlfriend lived in and I had this realization that maybe the dog was leading us to his girlfriend. Naturally I laughed at the thought and brushed it off as being too crazy, even for my high ass. No shit, 15 minutes later this dog runs up a driveway in this neighborhood and I hear a girl say, ""What the hell? Where did you come from?"" I instantly recognized the voice and yelled Marissa. Sure as shit, my buddy's girl comes walking down her driveway with this dog. She had been outside smoking and the dog had ran straight up to her. This f ing dog led us all the way across town straight to Marissa's house like it was our canine guide or something. My buddy asked if she knew the dog or if it was a neighbors and she said that she had never seen it before. To this day it still blows my mind that this even happened. After that we went to another buddy's house and left the dog at her house but it was gone when she came home the next day. I still wonder what happened to that dog from time to time. "
"  psych ward stories: Uncontrollable speech, violent acts to avoid meds, and a hilarious naked chase during yard time.","People who have spent time in a Psych Ward, what is the craziest thing you’ve witnessed?

I Worked in Involuntary Psych for 5 years as a technician. You see a lot, some genuinely funny and lighthearted, some very gross, a lot tragic.
Had an older gentleman that looked and dressed like a member of the rat pack. He was a lifer, pretty calm when he was on his meds. His thing was he had no control over his speech center, and would just stream of consciousness all day to whoever was near. He would say something like “I used to work down at the mill and my landlady grace she loved coffee or I would be in trouble with my uncle.” That was him asking you for a cup of coffee to drink. I miss him, very sweet man when he wasn’t yelling at you.
Sometime patients would come in that had been around a few times and knew the system. They won’t force you to take meds in jail, so these guys would act out violently to get to jail where they wouldn’t be forced to take meds. I responded to a call for staff, I was in the nurses station doing paperwork and I burst out of the door and headed towards the dayroom at a flat run. Dude heard me coming and waited in ambush at a 90 degree corner right at the end of the hall. He had picked up one of the light plastic chairs we had and swung it at me like a bat. I managed to get my arms up to block, but he stepped into the swing and used the chair like a lever, threw me 15 feet back down the hallway, I weigh about 150 lbs. I managed to get away with a small bruise on my arm and butt. The patient got what he wanted and was sent to jail. He should’ve been playing for the NFL.
One of the places I worked had these conjoined courtyards that were shared by two units at a time. A tech from each unit was assigned to monitor the yard, and we would usually sit on a bench where we could see everything and just chat during yard time. So this patient from the other ward came over to sit with us, smelled gross. He had paranoid delusions, real “tinfoil hat” stuff. I said to him, “Hey do you know the one place where the government can’t watch you? The shower!” To my amazement, it worked! He happily went to his unit to take a shower. Cue 10 minutes later this guy come running out of his ward and into the courtyard, butt naked and soapy, being chased by two other techs! I felt a little responsible for this, so I joined in the chase. He ran around the courtyard a few times before we chased him back into his unit and to his room. He jumped up on the bed and looked at us. Since it wasn’t my patient I let the other two techs take lead. The guy feinted left, then lunged right, to try to jump on his roommate’s bed. The two techs lunged after him, and managed to get ahold of his sweaty arms did I mention he was so slick and sweaty that he had already literally slipped out of our hands a few times? and the whole group of them tripped their way onto this second bed together. The patient got turned face down and landed on the bed. One of the unfortunate techs slipped on the tile floor and landed nose in to the patient’s butt cheeks. Ill never forget that."
"  a married person faces the realization of an inappropriate relationship with an attractive coworker, choosing loyalty to their spouse over temptation.","The most sexually attractive woman I’ve ever met in my life asked me to spend the night and I’ve realized I’ve been fostering an inappropriate relationship outside of my marriage

I’ve been working with this woman who just recently immigrated from Brazil and she is quite literally the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. We’ve been friendly but there’s always been a level of attraction present that I’m just realizing was intimate. I wanted her and she wanted me and neither of us knew it could understand that that’s what it was.
Well she may have I didn’t. Every Friday my office goes out for beers and she tagged along for the first time. She stuck next to me the entire night and I just couldn’t help but notice how amazing she looks. I have never been intimately attracted to a woman before like I am her.
We stayed late and both had a few more drinks than we should’ve. We talked and finally she asked me if I would come home and spend the night with her. Then I finally understood why I had been so interested in her.
I have a wife at home. I have 2 daughters. I have a family and responsibilities to all of them and I’m here chopping it up with a woman who might be a fun sexy escape but is nothing compared to the mother of my children and life partner.
I had been letting this friendship grow. Letting this pure animalistic lust grow in the both of us. I entertained the idea, “maybe if we just do it once”, “no one has to know” and more.
In that moment I told her she was very nice, but I have a partner who I can’t betray. I called an Uber and went home and slept it off."

She said, ""I've been thinking about this for a while but didn't talk to you about it. I found someone else."" Then she broke up with me right then and there. I asked if she cheated and she said no. ""We're just friends right now. But he makes me happy when I'm with him and you just... don't. You used to. But not anymore."" I tried sabotaging their relationship when I found him begging her for special pictures, tattled to her ultra-christian parents that he was twice her age, and did everything I could to be the insane one. Finally realized what I was doing, apologized, and promised to never talk to her or her family ever again. I sold the ring and used the money to buy a guitar and a boatload of zaza and spiraled out of control for three years. Flunked all my classes, got a dead-end job at a construction gig, slowly descended into borderline alcoholism. Couldn't leave the house or go to work or do my job without being high. Gained a ton of weight, let myself go. Finally contemplated sewer slide, planned it out with a 20-page instruction manual on how to make it painless, not screw it up, and not hurt anyone in the process. Never went through with it because I kept getting scared and spending my sewer slide fund on zaza and botles. Finally broke down and told my parents all of this. Asked for help. Spent another year in a rehab program with a therapist. Got out and have been clean for three years by this September and still wake up at 3am feeling sick every couple of months for the way I treated her after having spent six years telling her that I loved her."

When I was a broke college student, a wealthy older lawyer hit my car. No damage to his but mine was crumpled, and I spent all of my no money at the time keeping it on the road. I was going literally 7 mph in a parking lot and he was entirely at fault. We exchanged insurance info and I had to get a rental car until mine was fixed. He dodged the insurance calls for about two weeks, forcing me to pay out of pocket for the rental, about $600 which I definitely didn’t have.

This lawyer douche is really feeling himself and charming the room. He orders a glass of wine from me and then stops and says, “hey, miss, do I know you?” So I came back loudly with, “well not really but you hit my car in a parking lot a few years ago when I was a broke college student and stuck me with the bill.

My last semester at a certain college I was assulted by a football player for walking where he was trying to drive  he was 325lbs and I was 120lbs. while unconscious on the ground I lived a different life.
I met a wonderful young lady, she made my heart skip and my face red, I pursued her for months and dispatched a few jerk boyfriends before I finally won her over, after two years we got married and almost immediately she bore me a daughter.
I had a great job and my wife didn't have to work outside of the house, when my daughter was two my wife bore me a son. My son was the joy of my life, I would walk into his room every morning before I left for work and doted on him and my daughter.
One day while sitting on the couch I noticed that the perspective of the lamp was odd, like inverted. It was still in 3D but, just,wrong.I was transfixed, I couldn't look away from it. I stayed up all night staring at it, the next morning I didn't go to work, something was just not right about that lamp.
I stopped eating, I left the couch only to use the bathroom at first, soon I stopped that too as I wasn't eating or drinking. I stared at the fucking lamp for 3 days before my wife got really worried, she had someone come and try to talk to me, by this time my cognizance was breaking up and my wife was freaking out. She took the kids to her mother's house just before I had my epiphany. the lamp is not real. the house is not real, my wife, my kids. none of that is real. the last 10 years of my life are not f inh real!
The lamp started to grow wider and deeper, it was still inverted dimensions, it took up my entire perspective and all I could see was red, I heard voices, screams, all kinds of weird noises and I became aware. a fucking shit ton of pain. the first words I said were ""I'm missing teeth"" and opened my eyes. I was laying on my back on the sidewalk surrounded by people that I didn't know, lots were freaking out, I was completely confused.
at some point a cop scooped me up, dragged  me across the sidewalk and grass and threw me face down in the back of a cop car, I was still confused.
I was taken to the hospital by the cop seems he didn't want to wait for the ambulance to arrive and given CT scans and shit.
I went through about 3 years of horrid depression, I was grieving the loss of my wife and children and dealing with the knowledge that they never existed, I was scared that I was going insane as I would cry myself to sleep hoping I would see her in my dreams. I never have, but sometimes I see my son, usually just a glimpse out of my peripheral vision, he is perpetually 5 years old and I can never hear what he says."
"  high schooler used fake coupons for free items at fast food places and supermarkets, scamming the industry out of money.




","What is the most illegal thing you've gotten away with?

Back in highschool I used to use a lot of fake coupons. Basically just print off coupons that people make onto cardstock or something similar. They are usually very similar to real coupons, they just say 'free' instead of 'buy one get one free'. At first, me and my friends would primarily use them at fast food places since this is where we had the most success. If they were not found in the system, the manager would usually do an override. The best part is, if the coupon was identified as fake, the user is treated as the victim of a scam so you essentially can't get in trouble for it (there are plenty of facebook surveys and such that will give out fake coupons). One time we got 14 chicken sandwiches at one time and didn't pay a cent. Eventually we moved on from just getting food and started getting items from supermarkets. One time my friend got two 50$ visas in one day without any trouble. Unfortunately by the time I tried they had identified the coupons as fake. After about 6 months or so most places caught on and our little heist ended for the most part. Overall it's definitely not the most illegal thing I have gotten away with, but I did probably scam my town's food industry out of a couple thousand dollars."
"  fired on the spot for a scheduling miscommunication, the employee faced verbal abuse from the owner, leading to a mass walkout.","Hey Reddit, what's your best ""I got fired on the spot"" story?

The best was when I called in toward the end of the week at my job at Showmars. I had worked a lot at the beginning of the week, so I had several days off in a row and wouldn't be there when the new schedule was put up. 
This was pretty common, for our store at least. So I called in when I knew it would be rather slow and my manager answered and gave me a schedule. It was very similar to the one I had the previous week, so I asked him ""and this is for THIS DATE to THIS DATE? Okay, I just wanted to be sure since it's the same as last week."" He responded with something like ""I'm not stupid, I know how to give out your schedule.""
I show up for my next shift and find out I had been scheduled the previous day, and not this day. So I went to talk to my other manager who was in and explained what I had been told by manager 1 when I called. She was nice, and not-so-secretly hated him, so she told me that though the owner was pissed, she'd stick up for me when he showed up later, and that I could stay on that day since someone wanted to leave early.
Fast forward to later when the owner shows up. He insults me, berates me in front of my co-workers, and asks me if I want to keep my job before anyone has a chance to explain the mistake. 
My lovely manager 2 cuts in when he starts insulting my appearance (my white shirt wasn't effing white enough, I should put my bangs up somehow (which nobody else did, and it was a brand new shirt, bought earlier that day actually,))and tells him what happened, that it was not my fault, that I followed the rules and that I shouldn't be in trouble for someone else's mistake. I had even attempted to confirm the schedule to avoid this, and everyone on shift today would testify that I was a diligent worker and always did my best to get things done and help out others. 
Not capable of being wrong or apologetic, he tells me that from now on I have to come in to work and get my schedule instead of calling, and I had to show up between 3 and 4pm when it was slow. So on days I don't work, I still have to have someone drive me there in the middle of the afternoon just to get my schedule. But just me. Nobody else had to do this. Bullcrap. 
So my manager declares while casting desperate looks around the kitchen and at the people in the front that if this is how he thinks he can treat his employees, and this is how he thinks he can talk to women (see: insulting and berating me. There was a lot of sexism in there,) then he can work the entire store by himself the rest of the night because everyone will be leaving.
And we did. My manager, all my on shift co-workers, and even the kitchen staff cleaned up, clocked out, and left just as dinner rush began.
In the end I worked there for several more months, until I got a better job (thanks lovely manager 2) and quit. My manager 2 also got to file harassment against manager 1, before quitting, manager 1 lost his job somehow, and most of my co-workers got out right before someone reported him for hiring illegals after the kitchen staff began quitting."

Smelled awful too, like a mix of fecal matter and rotting durian. Certainly it didn't help that the liquid wasn't just smeared all over the floor, but spread across the walls too. There were effing hand prints across the wall, presumably when the geezer was trying to stand himself up.
I peered into the toilet, more of that brown liquid, along with chunks of corny poop. There's also this fluid in your digestion called chyme. It's basically the thing right before food turns into poop, the pulpy acidic liquid with partially digested food in it. I could see scraps of chicken breast and sauce mixed in there with the pulpy chyme.
As for the old guy? Well, turns out, he didn't merely faint. He actually *died*I was in a room with a fresh, decomposing corpse in the stages of Algor mortis. He had his pants off, presumably he crapped himself to death but I don't know. effer emptied himself like one of those cement mixers you'd see in a cartoon. Except you just replace the cement with a liquid that embodies death itself.
Needless to say, I, like him, emptied my digestive contents, just from the opposite end that he did. After that I quit. eff that place, man."
"  during an IRS audit, grandpa surprises the auditor with outrageous bets, turning losses into wins, leaving the attorney embarrassed.","The IRS decides to audit grandpa, and summons him to the IRS office. The auditor was not surprised when the grandpa showed up with his attorney.

The auditor said, ""Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, Which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I'm not sure the IRS finds that believable.""
""I'm a great gambler, and I can prove it,"" says Grandpa. ""How about a demonstration?""
The auditor thinks for a moment and said, ""Okay. Go ahead.""
Grandpa says, ""I'll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.""
The auditor thinks a moment and says, ""It's a bet.""
Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor's jaw drops.
Grandpa says, ""Now, I'll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.""
Now the auditor can tell Grandpa isn't blind, so he takes the bet. Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye.
The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa's attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.
""Want to go double or nothing?"" Grandpa asks. ""I'll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.""
The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there's no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.
Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can't make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he ends up urinating all over the auditor's desk.
The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. But Grandpa's own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.
""Are you okay?"" the auditor asks.
""Not really,"" says the attorney. ""This morning, when Grandpa told me he'd been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you'd be happy about it!"""
"  an animated algebra teacher, had a terrifyingly quiet meltdown after a student made a derogatory comment about disabled people.","Students, what was the biggest teacher meltdown you ever witnessed? 

My 8th grade algebra teacher, Mr. Cogburn, was an interesting guy. He was tall, had kind of wild-looking frizzy gray hair and beard, and had a sort of boisterous, larger-than-life kind of personality. He started every class by slamming the door and yelling. He yelled (or, as I would realize once I got into theater in high school, he projected) through the entire class period, though he never really came across as intimidating. He always had a yardstick in his hand that he would slap forcefully against the blackboard to emphasize what he was saying - he would also slap it against the desks of students who weren't paying attention, though he was exceedingly careful to not actually hit the student. It wasn't terribly uncommon for him to break yardsticks, and there was always another in the supply cabinet to replace the one he'd broken. He had a little song/chant he made up for remembering the slope-intercept form of an equation for a line that I will probably remember until the day I die. He also gave the most effective (and, to 8th graders, both hilarious and embarrassing) explanation of how to divide fractions: he stood on a desk and told us ""Always divide the top"" - here he pointed at his head - ""by the bottom."" Here he turned around and pointed at his own ass. ""Never divide the bottom, because the bottom"" - here he helpfully gestured up and down the length of his ass - ""is already divided.""
That's what Mr. Cogburn was like. He was big and loud and crazy, but not in a scary way. We told new students that the way to tell he was actually mad was if he started the class by shutting the door like a normal person and speaking quietly, and that was when they should be scared.
Now we get to the story of the meltdown.
Every year our school did an event called the Math-a-thon. Students were given math worksheets and tried to solve as many problems as they could in a set amount of time. People (usually the parents) would sponsor the students, pledging a certain amount of money for each problem correctly solved, and at the end the money was donated to a local charity that helps the disabled.
It was that time of year and Mr. Cogburn was explaining the Math-a-thon to my class, and when he got to the part about the charity and what they did, one boy - who probably thought himself incredibly cool and edgy - loudly said ""I don't know why anyone bothers to help those retards. We should just let them all die.""
And Mr. Cogburn...transformed. As I said before, dude was tall - well over six feet - but his height never came across as imposing at all. Now he loomed over that student's desk like the goddamn angel of death. He seemed to physically radiate pure rage, I swear to all that's holy you could feelhis outrage coming off him in waves. Even though he was focused solely on the one boy, students halfway across the room sank down in their chairs in pure terror, trying to disappear under their desks - I know, because I was one of them. We couldn't even look at him, not out of the usual ""shit, he's mad, don't make eye contact"" instinct most people have, but more like it was a form of physical protection; he was a burning sun of anger, and if we looked directly at that sun it might blind us.
He spoke very, very quietly to the boy for about a minute. I didn't make out what he said. Then he led the kid out of the room and shut the door. About a quarter of the class started crying as soon as he left. After a while the other math teacher came in and taught for the rest of the period.
What we all found out later - and which none of us, including that boy, had known - was that Mr. Cogburn's daughter, who he spoke about to us frequently enough, was not his only child. He and his wife had also had a son - a son that was born extremely physically disabled, and who had died at a very young age from health complications arising from those disabilities.
When he took that student out of the room, I think we all thought that he was going to kill him. He actually just took him down to the principal and explained what the kid had said, and the kid was suspended for a day. Mr. Cogburn also took the rest of the day off.
So that was the biggest meltdown I ever saw from a teacher, and it was sort of the inverse of a normal meltdown. When he was shouting, gesticulating wildly, and hitting our desks with yardsticks, we loved the guy and feared nothing. But that day when he got so quiet, we felt mortal f’ing terror."
"  how post-WWII American suburbia, with its housing developments, car culture, and social norms, is often misunderstood by non-Americans.","Americans of reddit, what is something non-Americans will never get?

Suburbia.
In the post-World War II baby boom and economic upswing, the US began a process of moving from cities to suburbs. Levittown was founded in 1947 outside of New York City and became the model for this kind of living. People flocked to it, particularly the affluent white people who drive American culture. (Levittown itself was restricted to Caucasians) I think that many cultural differences that non-Americans are wowed by come from this period.
The insulated individualism of Americans comes from selling cheap houses to individual families rather than large-scale apartment buildings.
This necessitated a car culture which fed back on itself. The suburbs took over farmland, so food growing needed to be centralized in the midwestern states. That meant long-haul trucking which meant more paved highways and ultimately the interstate highway system (which was also a civil defense structure for when the Russians invaded). This is why so many Americans can't drive standard-transmission cars. Because the model here is that the majority of a commute is on the highway.
Suburbia fed our s xual repression as well. Young people were restricted to where they could walk or bicycle until they could afford a car of their own. The closed-off nature of housing meant that any sexuality happened behind closed doors.
Even the red plastic cups fascinate non-Americans. When an American family wants to get together with other families, rather than go out to a public park, they'll invite everyone to one house. With so many people, it doesn't make sense to use the best dishes, cups, and flatware, so disposables are much more popular."

My stepfather at the time was entertaining our guests when I had decided to enter the living room to grab extra pencils for my homework. The neighbors were about to head back home when I said “thank you for coming , it was nice having you today.” my step father rose from the sofa, grabbed his drink and threw against the wall behind me, “ children are meant to be seen and not heard. Speak when you are spoken to “ and aggressively grabbed me by the arm and dragged me into the hallway out of sight.

To this day I don’t speak unless someone is talking to me directly."
"  obese woman's autopsy reveals metal pellets in her head from a childhood accident, leaving her blind and wheelchair-bound.","Autopsy doctors, what’s the most interesting thing in a body you’ve seen?

In medical school, my group’s dead body was an 80+ year old female who was EXTREMELY unfit. Morbidly obese with muscles half the size of any other cadavers. Her pectoral muscles were paper thin, to get some reference. We figured she was bedridden during her last few months, which would somewhat explain these findings.
When we started our neurology unit and began to dissect the infratemporal fossa, I discovered a small metal pellet under the skin behind her right ear. My tank mates and I went on to find dozens of these metal pellets strewn around her head’s anatomy, with some lodged into the cranium and others in the bones of her face.
We contacted her living relatives to get some clarification and they ended up revealing that when this lady and her brother were children (they said she was 8 years old) they were playing with an old decorative rifle that the family had mounted above the fireplace. Long story short, the brother accidentally discharged the rifle into the girl’s face 
The aftermath was this lady was blind and wheelchair bound for the rest of her life, and the pellets weren’t all removed. It was an interesting dissection with that information from then on."
  a mother's heartbreaking moment came when her 7-year-old son revealed his father's infidelity and lack of affection towards her.,"What is the most heartbreaking thing your child has told you?

In the late Summer of 2005, I was in the midst of extreme chaos. It seemed my ‘then husband’ had been colluding with our live-in Nanny to basically oust me from my own home. These two were doing all sorts of criminal behavior from setting up audio surveillance, to trying to engage in vicious arguments, to outright invasion of my home office, laptop and all of my credit cards and financial files. I knew they were trying to ‘set me up’ in some way to have our home become their home. Little did I know the depths of depravity that would be forthcoming. (The marital home was in my name and I had put the down payment on it and paid the majority of our monthly bills).
I had to eliminate this incendiary, collusive, creature “Nanny” and partner in crime, from my household. I also knew that I had to file for divorce from my sociopathic, narcissistic, pathological liar of a husband. What I tried to do was keep away all this insanity from my three, young children hoping all that was happening around their sweet, little world would not be anything they would/should/could understand. You see, I had a 7 yr son, a 5 yr old daughter and a 3 yr old daughter at that time. They were babies to me. No one would ‘rock their world’, on my shift.
One day, I had taken the afternoon off of work to meet with a new potential Nanny. I worked full time as the ‘Breadwinner’ as my ‘then husband’ worked 3 kinds of jobs but none full time and none seemingly paying well. I had planned to fire the Adulteress Nanny and divorce my abusive husband but that still required me to work full time. I knew I still needed help to continue to work as I was then to be a ‘single parent’. The Agency I used had me meet this new applicant Nanny at the train station near our home so I could interview her. I knew that I would need to hire her immediately and fire my current “Nanny”. I picked up my son from Elementary School and told him that we were going to the train station to meet a new Nanny as “Our Nanny would be leaving soon”. I was worried my son would be upset as she had been with us about 2 years by then so I said, “Honey, are you ok? I know this must be a surprise.” I waited thinking he might cry or be angry but instead my little boy said the thing that haunts me to this day. He said, “It’s about time Mommy.” I was stunned. I looked over my shoulder at him as we were traveling in my Honda Odyssey minivan to go to the station. There he was strapped into his little car seat, looking like a serious young man, at age 7. I said, “Honey, why would you say that?” By then I had pulled the car over, not realizing that tears had started to pool in my eyes and my throat grew tight. He said, “Mommy, Daddies aren’t supposed to kiss Nannies. Daddy is only supposed to kiss Mommy but he never does that anymore.” I was quietly sobbing as I had no idea until that day how much he had seen and knew. Those expressions hit me like “out of the mouth of babes' ' and “little children see more than you know”. I felt my heart actually feel like it had been punched. He unbuckled himself out of his car seat and walked over to me and put his little arms around me and said, “Don’t worry Mommy, things will get better and I will always love you.” I hugged him for the longest time in silence. I just didn’t know what to say.
It took seven and a half more years to finalize my acrimonious divorce and put that nightmare in my past. "
"  a wife uncovers mechanic's lies about car, involves police, wins court case for reimbursement after confronting him with evidence.","What was the most satisfying lie you caught someone in?

Husband’s car wouldn’t go in reverse, so he took it to a local mechanic. I had been to that mechanic in the past with my car and he was trying to charge me for a $3,000 part/work that turned out to be a simple loose bolt. Whew! Glad I got a second opinion on that one! So…I didn’t trust him, but my husband thought he’d be ok.
Husband was without a car far longer than the time the mechanic had said - about a couple weeks. Mechanic kept telling the husband…should be tomorrow….two days….next week. Total run around.
Finally I took my husband down there and the car wasn’t there. I asked the mechanic where the car was. He didn’t know. HUH? He said he had someone pick it up to fix it.
I asked, “Who is the guy and where is the car?”
Somewhere in the neighboring town. That’s all he knew. He said he didn’t know how to get to that town, which I knew was a lie. Anyone who lived in the area as long as I knew he had, would know how to get to that town.
I asked, “You let someone take our car, without telling us, and you don’t know where it is?”
Are.you.serious?
Husband was really upset but I said “Let’s go” and we drove straight down to the police station. We shared the story and we were told that the mechanic was probably getting ready to sell the car because they'd had multiple complaints against him.
An officer followed us back to the shop and asked the mechanic about the car. The officer got pretty much the same answers we did but told him he needed to have that car back in 24 hours or he’d be charged with auto theft.
Next day, the husband got a call: the car was back and fixed at close to $4,000.
Just a few days after picking it up, the original problem with the transmission happened again. We had the car towed to our home and I filed a complaint with small claims court for our money back plus court costs.
The court date came and the mechanic actually showed up! That was a surprise. He came and talked to us and said he was selling property in California and would be able to pay us the money but not that day. We went with him to speak to the judge who told him he’d have a month to get the money and set a new court date.
New court date came, and my husband got a call from him. The mechanic said his father passed away in California and he was out there so he wouldn’t be in court.
We went to court, told the judge what he told us, and the judge said he’d give him the benefit of the doubt and set a third court date.
After leaving court, I dropped my husband off at work and, on the way home, went right to the mechanic’s shop. He was standing outside smoking a cigarette. I turned around and drove in. He was nowhere to be found, but I asked one of the employees if he was there. Employee said yes….and went with me looking for him. I was not about to leave. He was hiding in the bathroom and I was going to stay there if it took all day and night.
Finally he came out and I had my phone's video on. I told him I was so sorry to hear that his dad died, but I suspected the judge would be very interested in what I had to show him. Then I turned and walked to my car.
He came running after me and said, “Meet me at the bank, I’ll have your money.”
Which I did…and…he did."
"  a doctor dismisses severe pain after pacemaker surgery, calls concerned daughters ""hysterical girls,"" misdiagnoses internal bleeding, and is fired for incompetence.","What’s the most unprofessional thing a doctor has said to you?

My mom went in to have a pacemaker installed — a relatively minor procedure. They were going to keep her overnight. The morning after the implantation, she was in severe pain; the woman who would never take even a Tylenol was saying the pain was a 10/10. The nurses called the cardiologist, but he would only order Tylenol 3 as he said she really shouldn’t be in any pain. I got on the phone with him to explain that she was suffering horribly, and my sister and I were very worried and needed him to give her something to help her. He said “You girls are just too hysterical. Why don’t you go get something to eat?” I was FURIOUS. We were in our 40s … certainly not “girls” and not having some sort of fit of pique. The nurse on the floor finally got another doctor to approve more serious pain meds. They think Mom’s lung was nicked during the procedure.
We took her home, and over the next day or so she got so lethargic it was scary. I took her to the cardiologist (along with my dad) and we explained that she was really not doing well. The doctor listened to her heart and said “it’s working great, she’s fine”. I told him that no, she was not fine, and that this inability to bounce back was very concerning and not like her at all. This arrogant doctor said “do you see that degree hanging on the wall over there”? I got nose to nose with him and said “I don’t think you want to start comparing IQs or education with me. Furthermore, you don’t know my mother like we do, and I’m here to tell you that something is terribly wrong!” At that point, my father (a much nicer person than myself) shushed me, and we took her home.
That night, my mom went to bed fairly early. A little while later, she came out with her pillow and blanket and said she wanted to sleep on the couch in the family room where we were, because she was afraid she was going to die alone in the bedroom. I immediately put her in the car and raced her to the ER. They didn’t want to treat her because they said she was under the care of a cardiologist. What they didn’t know is I had already called Kaiser’s head of medical affairs and fired the cardiologist. Once I used the executive’s name, the ER doctor agreed to evaluate Mom. They found out she was bleeding internally, dangerously dehydrated, and terribly anemic. She could have died!
I am SO over arrogant doctors. Never again. They either partner with me, or they are history."
"  after mustering the courage to ask out the barista, they went on dates, shared deep conversations, and discovered newfound happiness.","People who have the guts to ask their crush out. What happened afterwards?

 go to a cafe and the barista is a grade A cutie pie. I just broke up out of a soul sucking relationship three months ago that had laated 7 years and 5 years longer than it should have. We talked often after work (for me) and shared similar tastes in music if not an appreciation for all music, appreciation for film and discussed much of it--even suggested some movies to each other to watch, and shot sarcastic comments back and forth.
I mustered the courage to ask her to go pumpkin carving last weekend and she said she would love to. She asked the next day if I'd like to out because she had a surprise day of work off. We had a four hour conversation at a cafe downtown and then went on a two hour walk. Came back to the car holding hands (in all of my life I've never really done that). She said she wanted to not get into a relationship like that that quickly and I agreed. Drove her home and gave each other a hug good bye.
She asked if k wanted to come over that next Friday evening and cook dinner and watch some scary movies. We did and it was great. Watching people get chainsawed in half had the desired effect, I believe, because I ended up crawling into her arms and squeezing her palms. Watched the next movie and just ended up essentially hugging the entire time and scratching eachothers head. Time to go, and I go to give her a kiss on the cheek goodnight, but she goes for the lips instead. We laugh.
Two nights later and we spend Sunday all together and go thrift store shopping--too much rain for the planned pumpkin carving. Six hours later, I walk her to her car and we look into each other's eyes. I go in for the real deal kiss and she does too.
That was yesterday.
I feel a happiness inside I haven't felt inside in years. We are extremely blunt and to the point with each other (much of the dialogue between us in the above story is this way).
I like her because she makes me want to take care of myself and to be myself. I feel like exercising and studying/reading again for the first time in years all of the sudden.
It has only been little more than a week, and I am hesitant to out labels to this right now. In fact, I don't know why I'm even sharing this. I can tell she is very special to me, and that's all that matters I suppose."
  person disposed of dead deer on porch before spouse came home to prevent heartbreak or being creeped out.,"Other than cheating, what secret do you keep from your SO to prevent upsetting them?

My wife has a beautiful heart. I jokingly call her a Disney princess because any animal that she comes across she has to talk to, and greet. She has cried by seeing a dead raccoon on the side of the road before.
At the time, I was working day shift and she was working a swing shift. I had a busy day, but I saw she sent me some pictures of a young doe that was eating in our front yard. She seemed thrilled. I came home and saw the same deer! Dead. On my god damned porch. I felt like I started to hear “the first 48” theme playing as I realized I have six hours to get rid of this thing before my wife gets home and her world is shattered. I call my local city authorities thinking they wouldn’t want a dead animal in the middle of town. Turns out, they couldn’t care less. I called some local raptor shelters to see if they could take a stat donation but it turns out the dead deer business is booming and they didn’t have a need for donations at this time, especially in the next 6 hours.
Frustrated, I call my dad to vent and get advice on what to do. His response is only a “Hold on bud, I’ll be there in 15 minutes.” I go back inside to take care of the dogs and within the next 15 minutes I see me dad back his huge truck into my back yard, has the tail gait down and is knocking on my door with a pair of nitrile gloves on and another pair in hand for me. It was starting to get dark out, but we had that thing loaded up and found a special place to, uh. “Dispose” is it. We made it back with 20 minutes to spare before my wife got home.
I haven’t told my wife because I think it would either break her heart, or creep her out at how efficiently my dad can dump a body.

He took his shirt off, and he had a huge swastika covering his stomach. (The artist is Jewish) She didn't say anything, she just did the tattoo.

However, a few weeks before my birthday my dad started taking me out to look at cars and asking if I did get a car which one would I like?

I went to high school with someone who had some form of mental disability. She was a very nice person, very outgoing in that she was always trying to make friends, but had a very hard time picking up on social cues and social norms. She was easily peer pressured unfortunately, and often times people would convince her to do things because they thought it would be funny, and she either didn't know to say no or maybe just wanted to take a risk to become friends. She was always kind, and didn't have a bad bone in her body. It was extremely sad to see such a kind person so easily manipulated and treated poorly.
On the list of things I saw happen to her: Smoking cigarettes because the ""cool kids"" told her to, ultimately leading to her becoming a full time smoker. Smoking weed on lunch break with the ""cool girls"" in the forest, and then being left in the woods not going back to class because she was scared. Someone spiked her drink in home room and by 10AM she was drunk and didn't know what had happened. And the ultimate insult, the ultimate ""noah get the boat"" moment for me, was hearing of (never knew who did it or I would have said something) someone surprising her with a lunch they brought for her. This lunch consisted of a sandwich that was filled with magic mushrooms. This absolute waste of a human fed this poor girl, someone who the whole school knew had a mental disability, a VERY LARGE quantity of magic mushrooms and just let her unknowingly hallucinate at school. She was suspended for doing drugs at school (what a joke), and if memory serves me she never came back (or maybe left at the end of that school year)."
"  enterprising 4th-grade student became candy mogul, running a black market selling individually packed candies and earning substantial profits.","What “black market” did kids at your school run?

During elementary School in the 80s many candies weren't individually wrapped for resale in stores, think warheads etc. So, I bought bulk packs of candy, didn't matter what kind, although atomic fireballs were my cash cow.
I individually packed them, or maybe a couple to a pack depending on the candy. I used those tiny ziplocs you see people use for drugs. Being around adults a little devoid of scruples, I was able to get those in bulk from a local head shop called ""High on the Hill"" It was a surreal time looking back.
I was the only supplier for a year solid in 4th grade, I made so much bank for a 10 year old it was insane. I would make $100 a week just off of atomic fireballs. The bulk jugs were about 5 or 6 bucks each wholesale, and at a quarter each it worked out to about $60 a jug profit if I recall.
Luckily school came easy to me because it was a full time job keeping stock, packaging product, counting piles of change, budgeting, keeping a bank register (mom got a separate account that I used for my money) dodging the man etc. It was turbulent as I never really had a group of friends as a kid, but in the 4th grade I was the f’ing man.
Going from having no real ""good friends"" and having my time divided by either being picked on or ignored, to becoming the belle of the ball was surreal. Even at that time I was able to realize what was going on. Their smiles were all fake their interest was not in me, but rather what was in my bag any given day. Girls were not saying hello because they were being polite, or even the least bit interested in talking to me, they were just waiting their turn for their fix! That denim bag got more attention than I ever dreamed of, I was just along for the ride.
I had laid the groundwork and provided the blueprint. When the 5th grade started there was competition, but they were weak. They would always sell out, or only buy enough to make a few bucks here and there, largely selling lollipops or prepacked stuff, Hershey's kisses, bit o' honey or Tootsie rolls, whatever they could grab at the store before school. It was amateur hour. They had made a mockery of something I took seriously, as seriously as a 10/11 year old can take something.
I closed up shop pretty quickly after the school year began. The fast life and fast money was over. The excitement wasn't there, the smiles weren't as big. Kids came to me as a last resort. They bought the popular kids completely out before looking my way. It was like flipping a switch. My first day without the bag I had a few kids ask if I was holding, but once word got around that I was out of the game everything went back to normal. No friends, no conversation, no one to sit with at lunch or on the bus. No one interested, fake or otherwise. It's the first time I had ever really witnessed the dynamic of being disingenuine, I had always been authentic, and after it was all over, I was happy to stay that way.
I've never really recounted this time into words, as it turns out, I learned a lot of life lessons in the 4th grade!"
"  physician recalls cases of extreme faking: unconscious patient saying ""breathe,"" tongue sticking out, spit bubbles, sudden responsiveness, and convulsions for attention.




","Doctors, what’s the biggest case of “faking it” you’ve ever seen?

Physician here, I have so many of these, here are some of the best:
-Male patient, 18 years old, rolled in unconscious. Mom says he's been like that for the past four hours. Go to check his lungs when I hear something interesting. I place the stethoscope near his mouth and hear him breathe in normally, but then breathe out by saying 'breathe'. No joke.
--Male patient, 21 years old, admitted with inability to speak for last two hours and respiratory distress. Lungs clear, but we hook him up to oxygen for a few minutes. After he's taken off, his father comes running and drags me over, saying his sons tongue refuses to go back in after receiving the oxygen. I look at the kid and he's seriously just lying there with his tongue poking out like a child. I tell them to push it back in. A few hours later the dad tells me the boy is convulsing. I go to see without making my presence known and he's lying there just fine. The moment I ask the mom how he's doing, he starts 'convulsing'. Think of an odd version of the worm, but on his back.
--Female patient, 16 years old, admitted with complaints of recurrent seizures and frothing from the mouth. I look at her and she is literally blowing spit bubbles. I check her reflexes, everything is intact. The moment I turn away to check on another patient, she suddenly becomes 'rigid' and the spitting intensifies.
--Male patient, 30 years old, unconscious and completely unresponsive for six hours. This guy was totally dedicated to his act. I initially approached it as a stroke, but when the blood pressure, ECG, reflexes, pupils, etc all are normal....I start checking pain sensation. He slowly began to open his eyes and groan as I asked him to tell me his name, but the moment his Achilles' tendon was pressed, he suddenly sat up, stated his name, and declared himself cured.
--Female patient, 17 years old, complained of respiratory distress and convulsions. Everything's normal on admission, and she's conscious but refuses to eat. Parents are worried out of their minds, and every few minutes she has a 'fit' where she would just basically shake from side to side. She let slip to a nurse that she didn't want to go to school that week, so she was faking an illness. Since she was refusing to eat, the attending wrote up an order for a nasogastric tube (which was inserted and then removed by her in a matter of minutes)."
"  patient's self-pleasure mishap with magnets led to hospital visit, amusing encounters with staff, and a misunderstood security incident.




","Medical professionals, what’s the worst s x related injury you’ve seen at your workplace?

Embarrassing story from the patient end here... few years ago I was stroking the weasel, I have some neodymium magnets on my desk.. why? I was dismantling old hard drives, that's why. well... I bumped the desk, sent the magnets flying, saw is slow motion they were on a tandem collision course with Mr. Willy and panicked and tried to dodge... I rolled a f’ing 1 on that check.. two magnets met with my foreskin in between. these were tiny, strong magnets, and I couldn't separate them myself after 10-15 minutes of trying.. so at 10:30-ish at night I went to my neighbor as said ""Hey.. um... I need to go to the hospital"" and he said ""when?""... ""Now.""... ""Uhh.. ok man"" and we got to the emergency room, I checked myself in, and when I told the nurse what was wrong he lost it and cracked up.. I rolled my eyes and said ""yea.. yea.. whatever, just get them apart.. ok?""
GUESS WHO DIDN'T KNOW HEMOSTATS WERE MAGNETIC?!
NEITHER OF US.
So it took Nurse Chuckles a good 10 minutes to... ah.. secure the tips around the magnets and pull them apart through fumbling and trying his sweet heart's darnedest to contain the laughing.. he got them apart, I retrieved my magnets, and he had to leave the room and laugh down the hall.. another nurse popped her head in as I was examining the damage, nothing horrible, just a couple of bruises, but I didn't see her, and she gasped and caused me to damn near fall out of the bed, she was embarrassed, I was embarrassed, she ran, and then Laughs-a-Lot came back, along with security because apparently the chick thought I was masturbating. That was fun to explain, security didn't really believe me till Nitro-Boy had to confirm it through more laughing. I was finally discharged with now half the hospital staff laughing at me and a referral to a Urologist for a checkup.. I never did tell my neighbor the truth about that trip... maybe it's about time I do."
"  bartender witnesses unjust arrest of patron, confronts cops, boss tackles officer to defend patron, cops leave, no legal consequences.","Bartenders, what is the craziest story you have from behind the mahogany?

I was a bartender at this Irish pub in California owned by these two brothers. Anyway the cops in this town are EXTREMELY power crazy, from lack of anything better to do in an affluent area. Anyway, this guy is at the bar getting shithoused. He's nice though. He walks outside for a cig, stumbles a little bit, leans against a tree, finishes up and comes back in. A couple cops follow him into the bar, and come up behind him.
They accost him...not sure for what reason, he was quiet outside and I watched him the whole time, and he didn't do anything out of the ordinary. Anyway they grab him and say ""You're Drunk! You're under arrest for public intoxication"". Now, yeah the dude is drunk, but he's been in before and he always cabs home or something.
I say ""Hey he is NOT drunk in public, he's in a private establishment and leave him alone, he's not harming anyone"". I admit, I'm no lawyer, so I'm not sure of the technicalities behind him being in public or not, but it was still f’ed up.
The cops tell me to shut the f up, which I don't, so they then say ""OK fine, now he'll be drunk in public!"" and drag this guy out of the bar into the street.
I'm flipping out, but what could I do? One of my bosses was in back, and hears whats going on (only a few seconds have passed). Now I had worked with the other brother before, and this was my first time working with/meeting this particular brother.
Being the scrappy little Irishman that he is, he comes out and screams ""WHAT THE F IS THIS?!"" And hops over the bar, runs out the front, and TACKLES one of the officers to defend his patron. Other cop lets go of their original target, and whips out his nightstick and starts taxing my boss, while he wails on the other cop.
He gets beaten pretty badly, and there's a lot of folks watching by this point, and the cops look around and simply leave. A couple employees bring my boss back in, and he's got blood all over his face, he looks at me and says, ""Hey there, what's your name, lad? Don't believe we've met yet"".
This all went down so quickly that I just stood there pokerfaced until that moment, then we all had a laugh and got drunk.
There were no legal repercussions on any party involved in this event."
"  a person disowned their parents due to their parents' harmful behavior, including attacking their partner and being unsupportive.","Parents who have 'disowned' their children. Why?

I had to disown my parents. My sister committed self mutilation several years ago and after that, my mom was understandably depressed. She would call me while I was at work and cry and yell and say all sorts of inane things. My dad wouldn't do anything about it and she wouldn't see help. I eventually lost that job because of this.
At that time I had started dating a girl who soon after moved a few states away to attend college (she had enrolled before we started dating). Things were going well with her and when I lost my job, I took it as a cue to move up there with here. My mom seemed to be getting better, we kept in regular contact, until a year later when the inane calls started again. Only this time she had resorted to attacking my girlfriend for ""purposely keeping me away from her"". She even started insulting my girlfriends' mother - get this - because she suggested my mom come and visit us, and my mom saw this as being told what to do.
Meanwhile I was working every hour I could and barely getting by. My girlfriends' parents gave us help whenever they could but my parents would grit their teeth at the tiniest mention of even $50. And then they bought an RV.
After that we got in to a particularly heated discussion about her behavior - well, I say discussion, but they never really listened to me (my dad especially would always yell, ""KNOCK IT OFF"" if I ever tried to come to my own defense about anything) - and she basically told me I needed to break up with my girlfriend and move back in with them. I decided to distance myself from my entire family in response. I like some of my extended family, but I don't want to even chance coming in to contact with my parents ever again.
Since then we've moved back down to the original state (without my parents' knowledge), and I don't ever plan on speaking to them. I'm changing my name soon.
Sometimes I really wonder if I had paid more attention to my parents' behavior sooner, if I could've helped my sister.."
"  bullied at school, person snapped and fought back, putting an end to the teasing and gaining respect from their tormentors.




","People who have snapped on a bully at school, what's your story?

In fourth grade Ronnie and Freddy kept ridiculing me, making remarks, teasing me at recess. I was raised to be peaceful and accommodating. I tried to ignore them, but it got under my skin. I decided to stay near the teacher at recess. They left me alone then, but I couldn't stay near the teacher all the time. They accused me of being teacher's pet. That bugged me even more. This went on for weeks.
When recess was over we lined up on the sidewalk to go back indoors. One day Ronnie was right behind me. He started teasing me.
I lost it. I took him down. When they pulled me off him I was pounding his head against the pavement. Ronnie stopped teasing me. Noting the improvement, I challenged Freddy to a fight after school. A crowd gathered. It took only a few seconds for me to pin Freddy to the ground and force him to surrender. That ended the teasing from Freddy.
A day or two later my mother and I were called to the principal's office. My father was overseas in combat. Ronnie and his mother were there. I never knew where Ronnie's father was. As soon as the meeting started, Ronnie's mother launched into an indictment of me. Before she was finished the principal cut her short. ""Now let's hear the other side,"" she said. I stated my case.
The principal heard me out, then said, ""Gentlemen don't fight. It's against the rules to fight on the school ground. I want you two to shake hands and apologize."" I did as told, Ronnie had to be prompted to apologize.
But that's not the end of it.
Years later, in my early 20s I had a job at a research institute at university. The institute director's beautiful young wife said to me, ""A young man called Ronald J. was just hired. He says he beat you up in grade school.""
""That's not exactly how I remember it,"" I replied.
""I'm not surprised,"" she said.
A week later there was a party at the director's house. Ronnie and I were there. Ronnie was slender, maybe 5'9"". I was 6'4"", about 195 pounds, ran 6 miles per day.
The director's wife maneuvered Ronnie over to the the group where I was, and said, ""Ronald, let's hear how you beat up Polanski in grade school.""
Ronnie mumbled something about a mistaken impression and left shortly afterward. He was careful to avoid me from then on.
Some time during the next year or so I laughed and mentioned it to my mother. She said the principal had said to her, ""I wish I had been there to see it when Polanski pounded Ronnie's head on the sidewalk."""
"  wife fabricating a story on a radio show, claiming his death and custody of their child, made husband consider divorce.","Divorced men of reddit: what moment with your former wife made me think ""Yup, I'm asking this girl to divorce me.""?

My wife at the time told me that she had called a local radio station which often discusses hardships that military families go through and sometimes gives away $1,000 to a family in need of help. She said that she informed the radio station of my deployment and how I didn't come back the same, and she told them about our daughter (2 months premature and only 8 months old at the time) who had numerous health problems. My wife explained to me that the radio station hadn't given away the $1,000 in quite a few weeks so they were going to give us $10,000 for her telling such a heartfelt story. She called me while I was at work to tell me what had happened and I was really excited...asked my SNCOIC to help me draw up a savings plan and figure out which debts should be paid off first, etc. Things were looking up.

I get home that night and rather than being greeting with an enthusiastic hug, she points to the loft and mouths ""not now, I'm on the phone."" so I go upstairs and wait for her to finish. While I was waiting I could hear her saying things like ""yeah I can get those papers to you"" and ""no problem, I can have that ready by tomorrow."" Hmm. Maybe they need identification and proof of my deployment or something, whatever.

Fast forward to later that night and like usual I'm having trouble sleeping. I decide to get on the computer and listen to the podcast from the radio show. After a few searches I find it and start listening to it. This is where my blood starts to boil. She told the DJs that she was a single lady living on her own and that her sister married a Marine and they had a child named Marie (our daughter's middle name). She goes on to say that Marie is now in her custody after the Marine husband (me, sort of) was un-alived in Afghanistan and the mother (her in real life single sister with no kids Jacqui) was un-alived in a car wreck and Marie was now my wife's responsibility.
Hundreds of people called in and offered to help, many of which owned business and wanted to offer things like baby supplies or completely furnishing a nursery for her. Literally thousands of people had heard this fabricated story, including some of my coworkers. It was the radio station she was on the phone with and they were asking her to provide death certificates and a birth certificate for Marie, which is why I was shooed away."
"  permissive parent allowed wild parties, drugs, and early sexual experiences. Despite chaotic upbringing, child eventually found stability and success.","People who grew up with overly permissive parents, what were the craziest things you were allowed to do?

My mother told me at an early age that one day I would rebel, and instead of fighting me she's going to guide me through it. Said that she'd rather know what drugs I'm doing and which women I'm dating so that she can provide said guidance than for me to hide it. Said that she wanted me to ""sow my wild oats"" while I was young, so that I could buckle down when it really mattered. And, well, that's exactly what she did.
And all of it was absurd.
We were dirt poor, living in a mobile home in the shitty part of town when I turned 12. Between child support, disability and welfare she was only getting about $600 a month. (when she went after my father for more child support, raising it from 50 a month to $400 a month he counter sued for custody... that was fun...) So, she had to sell drugs to get by. Making our trailer the trailer everyone always hung out at. My teenage years were a non-stop party. I'd normally wake up to find upwards of 10 people crashed on the floor. In a single-wide.
I started smoking, drinking and being s xually active at 12. Weed at 13, acid and meth at 14. I was also 13 when I had my a girlfriend move in for the first time. She kept running away from home, the last time getting in a truck with a random dude who was going to take her to texas... and our mom's agreed maybe it was best she stayed with us for a while. From that point forward my mother had no qualms with girls sleeping over. That said, I haven't had an empty bed since I was 15, and have zero experience being single. (which I see as a bad thing, but what can I do ...)
While my home life was a constant party, school life was miserable. I was always the hated kid. The poor, dirty, dorky kid, that people loved to f with for the sport of it. The rest didn't want to associate with me out of fear of being targeted. ...Because of the contrast between home and school I had a tendency to, well, not go. Got sent to BD school in 7th grade, and expelled 4 times in high school.
To her credit, she was able to use the situation to make friends of all of my friends, and use them to control me. They would do whatever she wanted because they didn't want to lose their invitation to the party. If she didn't like someone she would turn the group against them. She knew everything I ever did, too.. She was like a mob boss, who's only purpose in life was me. ...And she was right about sowing my wild oats - by the time I was 18 I was pretty over partying. Didn't care much for most drugs anymore, was tired of chasing ass and just wanted a real girlfriend, etc. And went into said relationship with ample experience for my age...

I didn’t like him from the start and told my girlfriend that I thought he had bad intentions and that he had the hots for her. She says he’s not her type and they are just friends.

So I give her a choice and she says she wants to be dropped off at the neighbors. So I drop her off only to return because she’s dressed in paper and it’s raining plus I just went to three grocery stores to find pumpkins. We go back to our house and argue. Next week she gets paid and I ask her to get dog food because I’m broke and couldn’t get any. I find out that she’s spent all her money on her friends after a few days of lying about having money.

"  cops were fascinated by high school drug dealer, who skillfully avoided searches until his shoes exposed hidden compartments.","Cops, what criminal actually fascinated you with their criminal skills?

This guy in high school, we'll call him Luis, was a known drug dealer. He didn't make it a secret. Everyone bought weed and harder stuff off of him. The cops constantly pulled him over to search him, and whenever a drug related thing happened at school he was often the first kid they pulled into the principal's office.
But they would never catch him with any drugs.
The principal used to turn all of his possessions inside out on a weekly basis. Apparently schools can do that, but cops can't. They regularly cut locks off his gym locker and his regular locker in hopes of finding his stash, but they never found it.
One time there was a rumor going around that his stash was stored in a locker not assigned to anyone, which prompted the administration to search every single locker in the school. I remember we had to stand in the hallway and unlock it so the principal could have a look inside. They definitely caught people with drugs but not the Luis. Turns out he started that rumor.
Drug dogs were a regular occurrence. Once a month they brought them into the school, and they were present at every sports game.
Luis was one of the only, if not the sole supplier for the whole school. The administration had no idea what to do. They would catch kids with weed and the kids would flat out say ""I bought this from Luis"" Luis would encourage them to say it. They would then flip Luis' shit inside out, cops would search his car, and he consented to all of it, and laughed when they found nothing.
This was probably close to 15 years ago now. The Vice Principal loves to tell the story about how they eventually ""caught"" him. Vice principal's younger son asked for these shoes for Christmas that had a secret compartment in them. Light bulbs go off in his head. The first day back after holiday break, he calls the school's DARE officer and pulls Luis out of class. They bring him into to office and flip all of his shit out on the table. Then the Vice principal tells him to take his shoes off. Turns out his hunch was right. He had hidden compartments in his shoes.
But there were no drugs in there. I guess Luis is laughing his ass off at this point. This was pre-everyone owned a cell phone era. Luis has the audacity to explain that he hasn't seen any of his classmates for 3 weeks, he had not take any orders yet. Had the Vice Principal waited a day, he would have caught him."

When he talked about it he sounded like he was gonna nut. He would tell me about all the amazing things his ex's are doing and how he pushed them to do it. When he wanted to get with someone new he talked about it in the weirdest way possible ""Jessica mentioned she won't see her family for christmas because they are fighting I'm gonna ask her out then help them make up"".

  fiancée's affair with older man shocks man who was about to marry her in four months. Seeking advice.,"I found out the woman I am going to marry is cheating on me with an old man

I found out the woman I am going to marry is cheating on me with an old man. Yesterday I met my fiancée at our wedding venue for our 4 month out meeting to finalize details. We drove to the venue separately because she was leaving straight from work. Towards the end of the meeting she let me know her friend was dropping off her rental car and needed a ride home and asked if it would be ok. I said yes thinking nothing of it as it wasn’t that far from our home and I know her friend well. I get home and tried to get in touch with her for the next 3 hours. No answer. At approx the 1:30 mark I texted her friend and asked if she had made it to her ok. I was very worried. My fiancée ends up coming home and says sorry it took longer than expected. She hung out with her friend for a bit before leaving. Ok no biggie just let me know next time please. Her friend gets back to me a few minutes later and says “sorry I couldn’t make it to the venue. didn’t see your fiancée tonight.” I asked her why she would say this and she said she didn’t know she can’t control what her friend says and walked outside. I’m sketched out by this point. I have never done this but I looked at her phone records (yes I did and don’t regret it). I saw that when she went outside she called her friend that had texted me right after she went outside. I also saw an hour long call with a number I didn’t know on the way to the venue. I asked her what rental place they went to and multiple other questions. She had quick answers and they seemed legit. I thought “maybe I’m crazy here. I need to chill and sleep on it.” This morning I asked her to please see the text from her friend asking her to pick her up and I would apologize for questioning her the previous night. She said no. I said “when I caught up to you yesterday on the way to the venue I saw you were on the phone. Who was that?” She said “oh that’s the friend I picked up later on.” That’s when I knew for a fact she was lying. I said I looked at her phone records and knew that wasn’t true. She then changed her story to say “oh I needed to meet up with a coworker to discuss a patient.” “Who is the coworker and why couldn’t you discuss that over the phone?” “I need to show him the techniques in person. His name is Michael.” Ok I am sketched out beyond belief at this point we never lie to each other. I asked to see the texts with Michael. She wouldn’t let me see. I said “why not if there’s nothing to hide. Are you having an affair? Do you not want to be together anymore?” She pauses and proceeds to tell me all the things that are wrong with me. I work too much and I don't spend enough time with her and don’t listen. I’m astonished at this point, all of this is news to me. I put two and two together at this point I know something sketchy is going on. I again ask to see the texts. It took about a half hour of convincing to see these texts and they were crazy. Flirty in nature and talking a lot of shit about me. Also how she wanted to be with him and how they’re essentially in love. She started this job 6 weeks ago (he is her coworker). He is also 25 years older and divorced with multiple kids. I have been financially supporting her for the last few months as she got back on her feet and was working extra so she wouldn’t have to pick up a part time job. We own a house which we both live in with 3 dogs and a horse. Sorry for the novel I am beside myself right now. I did not see this coming and we were going to get married in 4 months. Any advice would help."

My sister disrespected me at my wedding so I ruined hers. My sister, Laura, and I have always had a tumultuous relationship. She has always been the type to steal the spotlight, even when it wasn't hers to take. But I never thought she'd stoop as low as to ruin my wedding day. On the day of my wedding, Laura showed up in a white dress. Yes, a white dress. It was almost identical to my own bridal gown, and she spent the entire ceremony and reception trying to upstage me.

I'm a graphic designer by profession, and I was in charge of designing the invitations. So, I made a small change to Laura's invitations - I changed the time of the ceremony, pushing it forward by two hours. On the day of her wedding, Laura arrived at the venue expecting to see a crowd of guests. Instead, she found an empty venue. The guests started arriving two hours later, just as planned. Laura was flabbergasted and embarrassed. She asked me what happened, and I told her, ""Maybe they just wanted to upstage you."" She looked at me, puzzled, then realization dawned on her. I had my revenge, and it felt satisfying. But more than that, I think Laura learned a valuable lesson that day. She never tried to steal my spotlight again."

","What is the most serious question you've ever had to answer?

What is the most serious question you've ever had to answer? How does your son feel knowing he murdered his brother? I was asked this less than a week after my son died. Backstory: My 6 year old son drowned. The only witnesses were his 9 year old sister and almost 3 year old brother. My sister was supposed to be watching them but she got busy with her horse and ignored the kids…..please no judgement about it. They snuck away and ended up in my cousin’s stock pond. No adults saw what happened until my sister found them. My daughter has cerebral palsy and has a hard time articulating things and for months after his death she was nearly totally non-verbal. My nearly 3 year old couldn’t tell anything except “we go swim”. I went with my son in the ambulance and the Sheriff’s Office was investigating, as expected in that situation. Within hours of his death a story was starting to build in town. The story was that they took off their new shoes and my youngest son threw older son’s shoes into the pond and he went in to get them. This story was a patent lie…..my children all still had their shoes on. A nurse in the ER handed my son’s shoes to me. The only truth was they had new shoes, which I had purchased two days before. My son’s funeral was on Wednesday. That Friday I stopped by a small convenience store to pick up a soda and some cigarettes for my husband. One of the cashiers asked how we were doing and said they had been at the funeral and how nice it was. Very small town so easy to figure out I was the parent of the child that drowned. Before I could respond some loudmouthed asshole piped up with the question, “How does your son feel knowing he murdered his brother?” I spun around around “What the eff are you talking about?” but customers were already pulling stuff out of his arms and pushing him out the door. The manager told him not to come back. After a few moments of shock I asked them what he meant so they told me the story going around. I told them it was untrue, no shoes were taken off, nothing was thrown in, that his shoes were still in my car in the bag of his belongings that I couldn’t force myself to carry into the house yet. It seems that everyone in the store had heard that story (guess it was a slow week for the gossips) and were surprised how untrue it was. I never heard that story again so I hope they all spread the truth. Even if he had thrown shoes into the pond that would not be murder and I was horrified at the idea of that lie following him around the rest of his life. It still makes my blood boil when I think about that fat faced son of a bitch standing there so smug and self-righteous. It’s not often I hope karma hits someone but I hope she chews on him for a very long time."
"  a entrepreneur's financial collapse brings bankruptcy, separation, and personal struggles, but he finds hope in rebuilding his life and career.","What does it feel like to go from being wealthy to being poor?

What does it feel like to go from being wealthy to being poor? It’s absolutely horrible. I was 50, had recently sold my very successful car washes, had a $1MM in my checking account, the big house, kids in private school and life was grand. I was focused on growing my other business (car wash equipment sales) when the manufacturer we represented lost a client that accounted 1/3 of our business, Hurricane Katrina hit (followed by several other hurricanes), and then the great recession. I had stopped taking a salary and started loaning the company money. I was determined to work through this. I even spent my retirement in a last attempt to turn things around. Fast forward, the company was broke, I was broke, and I couldn't pay the house mortgage. I had to give up the house and shut down the business. A personal bankruptcy soon followed, and then a separation from my wife of 30 years. The stress was unbearable, and I contemplated sewerslide. The only thing that stopped me was that my dad had taken his life when I was 26, and I knew first hand the pain that my loved ones would bear for my actions. The worst part is the loss of self confidence and depression, followed by the loss of “friends”. It’s amazing how quickly they disappear! I will say that two friends stuck by me. One in particular would check on me and take me out to ride his motorcycles to help take my mind off of things. I moved into a friend’s rental property and I started looking for work. I had owned my own companies since college, was a past Entrepreneur of the Year finalist, and had never really worked for anyone. At the worst, I was working at a construction company repairing equipment in their yard, collecting food stamps and living alone. Fast forward a couple of years. My wife and I got back together, we moved to Texas, and I took a job back in my industry (building car washes). We now rent a nice home, and were recently able to buy a nice used car. It gets better every day. I love my job, and I hope to get back into car wash ownership (with investors), while continuing to do what I do."
"  after adopting their 12-month-old daughter, the parents discovered her harrowing past of in-utero substance abuse and severe physical abuse.","What was the most soul wrenching secret you discovered about your children?
 
What was the most soul wrenching secret you discovered about your children? Three months after adopting our 12 month old daughter, we finally got her case file. It was supposed to come with her, so to speak, but these things are always messy. We knew she had been removed from her birth parents as they had somewhat low IQs, criminal histories, and were unable to care for her, despite major assistance including 24 hour in-home carers (this was not a possible permanent solution). So we were nervous, but we decided to put our names forward to adopt her. We were chosen and had experienced a chaotic but deliriously happy three months with a little 1 year old dynamo - she had some quirks, but was overall a happy, friendly wee girl. And then the report arrived and shook us to the core. She’d experienced sustained and high levels of in-utero substance abuse zaza, synthetics, crystal). She had witnessed frequent physical abuse - dozens of police reports, both parents beating each other. The real soul-destroyer? She’d experienced severe physical abuse at the hands of her birth father, between the ages of 2 and 7 months - until the 24 hour care started and he did it in front of them. Her crime? Not lying perfectly still while getting her diaper changed. The birth mother stayed (and is still with) that horrible man, despite losing her daughter. She still has visitation rights and we are constantly abused by the birth father, but he does not have visitation rights at the moment and hopefully never will, but we can’t guarantee it. it sickens me, that anyone would hurt my precious bubba. But now we knew why she freaked out when my husband tried to change her diaper."
"  after renting their house to a family, the homeowners discovered extensive damage and received a threatening letter from a neighbor's friend.","What is the most unsettling thing someone has said to threaten you?

What is the most unsettling thing someone has said to threaten you? My husband and I decided to move back to Oklahoma from North Texas due to issues with his employer. We rented our house out to a family and hired a management company. In the lease, we said no animals in the house. They lived there for 2 months and then contacted us saying they found a better house and wanted out of the 12 month lease. It just so happened that my husband's former job really wanted him back and offered a whole lot of money and changes to get him back. He also disliked his new job, so we were moving back to Texas. We figured we would have to rent an apartment for a while since we leased the house. I had already put a deposit down on an apartment when I got the message from our property manager about our renters wanting out. I called the apartment complex and canceled, getting my check back. I told the property manager that we would let them out of the lease with no penalty and return deposit if the house was just as we left it. It was now 3 months into the lease and we were moving back in. When I walked into my beautiful house… the smell was horrible! The berber carpet was ruined. Not only stained but also ripped. There was a hole in the bathroom wall that they attempted to patch with putty and paper towels. There was a hole in the ceiling where someone stepped through it. The glass door to the backyard was completely scratched on the inside and outside. Like, really deep claw grooves! Tile was broken in the master bathroom floor. They did not clean anything and we had the house professionally cleaned for them to move in. I was shocked and livid! I took photos and sent it to the property manager telling her not to release the deposit! This was just in a few months?! So, before we moved our things back in, I had to scrub the whole house and call a professional carpet cleaner. Try to fix the runs in the carpet as best we could. And my husband patched the holes the right way. I got a nasty call from the renter mad that we are keeping the deposit. She was sent a certified letter complete with photos explaining why they would not get it back. She said it wasn't fair because they “were doing us a favor"" giving our house back. So, apparently, our renters became besties with the people next door. Not surprised because they were very similar people. Not good! That's a whole different story. Anyway, the woman next door worked for a lawyer. We got a letter in our mailbox about a week after we moved back in. It was from a law office. The letter was written on official letterhead and signed by the lawyer on the top of the page. It was so poorly written that it obviously was NOT written by an attorney. It said things like, “and anyways… the house wasn't spotless when my clients moved in.” It was the most rediculous thing I've ever seen. It threatened to sue us if we did not return their clients deposit. I knew that our neighbor had written it and most likely her boss knew nothing about it. So, I responded with a certified letter to that attorney with a copy of the original letter and hand written envelope. I explained that we would not be returning the deposit and urged the plaintiff to take us to court! We would then counter sue for the entirety of the lease, plus fees. Not a week later, we found out our neighbor had been fired. She did steal company letterhead and forged an official signature. She could have been jailed. Several months later, I was checking my mail and our former renter was visiting her bestie next door. She walked over to me and said that I should be careful when I'm outside. “You never know when a black Explorer could lose control and run you down.” Psycho."

What's The Most Action You've Gotten In A Single Day? This one comes from my young, swinging, open marriage days…(this sounds made up, but it really is true). So my wife and I at the time that had a couple in our city that we regularly fooled around with. My wife and “R” were more like boyfriend/girlfriendish, but me and his wife “M” were pretty much a few drinks and shag. All good. I had a few other women on the side as just s*x partners. Well living the good s*x life and being 23 years old, I wanted to see if I could pull off 3 of these lovers in one day, just to notch my belt and say that I did. Scheduling was going to be tricky, cuz I had to work that day. So I figured, (names are changed of course), I can bang Michelle around lunchtime, and let her be a little late coming to work (yea she worked for me), then I can bang Natalie (my main side piece), on my way home, and have s*x with my wife around, oh say, 9ish should be good. Bu when I get home around 7pm, “M”s car is in the driveway, and I thought that was odd. I walk in and my wife is getting dressed getting ready to leave, and i’m like, “What’s up?” She says, “I’m going over to R and M’s house, it’s Wednesday, our date night remember?” Given they day I had, i totally slipped my mind. “M is upstairs, I got her already warmed up for you.” They’re both bisexual, so it goes like that. I’m like well, I did say I wanted 3 today, but that wasn’t what I expected, but when in Rome. So wife leaves, M is in the bed “amusing” herself while I rinse off, and it’s off to the races. Mission accomplished…I thought…but…. I’m downstairs re-hydrating when wife gets home, fairly tipsy, and looks like she had a great time, but still horny as hell, as she says, “Save anything for me?” By this point i’m like damn I don’t even know if I can pull this one off, but a good man-whore never says no, so I did. It’s like bowling three strikes in the 10th frame, you never know if that’s ever gonna happen again. Needless to say, I called in to work the next day."
"  neglectful mother with a distant and toxic relationship, failed to protect and support her child through traumatic experiences.","What’s the worst kind of mother you could possibly have?

What’s the worst kind of mother you could possibly have? I was talking on the phone with my mom a couple months back. We don’t have the best relationship, and neither of us have ever been close to the other. I’m 1 of 3 siblings, and I am the middle child, and I remember growing up that my older sister and my mom were the best of friends until she moved out and joined the Navy. Then, when my mom divorced my dad, she often took my younger sister, who was more outgoing than I was, out shopping and out to eat. They’d talk about boys, relationship advice, whatever…. things I didn’t have a lot of interest in. I often felt left out, especially when she would take my sister out of school early and the two of them would take out of town trips together without telling or inviting me along. Staying over at my mom’s boyfriends’ houses, going to the Mall of America, the Wisconsin Dells, etc etc. This is when my sister and I were 12 and 14, with myself being the older, so it wasn’t as if I wouldn’t have been able to take care of myself. Anyway, fast forward a few years, I’m now 22 years old. I’ve been in therapy on and off for depression and anxiety. My mom and I don’t really talk about the therapy stuff. It’s something she’s never been interested in, and something I haven’t been comfortable sharing with her for a long time. However, a couple months ago my car went to the shop (a valve failed and the calipers got locked up, costing several hundred dollars for parts, as well as labor). I was saving up the money, out of a working vehicle for a couple months, and needed a ride to my appointment (it was an inpatient appointment with a trauma specialist I had been referred to, and it was the first I had with her, so she wanted to meet me in person before moving the other visits to video visits). Anyway, I called my mom. I told her about my car troubles, asked if she might be working that day (she works as a hospice care worker in the county, and often drives through town for her job anyway), hoping to catch a ride. We got to talking about the appointment, the specialist, other upcoming appointments, and we beat around the bush for quite a bit before she finally said, “Well I knew he had touched you, I just hadn’t known he’d had sex with you.” This is in reference to her boyfriend violently raping me when I was 14. I didn’t get mad or upset at her. I still felt the same numb and empty feeling I have when it comes to my mom. I told her, “I don’t really think it matters how far it went, what matters is you knew and did nothing.” I’ve struggled with my relationship with my family for years. I love them. But I think I’m only able to love them at a distance. I don’t talk to any of them regularly. My dad and I last spoke in September, when my grandpa died. The last time I spoke to my mom was that phone conversation, and when she asked if I was coming to her house for Thanksgiving. I lied and told her I had to work because I still don’t believe I’ve fully processed that phone call. It’s complicated. I love my mom, I love my family, and I know they’re not perfect, and I know that they don’t necessarily look out for my best interests… or really care about what I’m up to or how I’m doing because none of them check in. I told my therapist about the phone call and she said, “You know your mom will never be able to empathize with you about any of what we talk about, right?” She’s also told me my parents had no business having children. I think I am still fully wrapping my head around how toxic and horrible my mom is as a person. But that phone call really started opening my eyes to how she’s treated me in the past and how little she cares, even now."
"  an abusive wife exerted control, made false accusations, exploited finances, and received biased treatment against him due to his gender.","What's something that sucks about being a man?

What's something that sucks about being a man? I have a family member who was married in December of 2015. About a month or two after getting married, his wife started showing some very disturbing and troubling behavior. She had to control everything he did, when and what he ate. If he did anything to displease her, she would leave often with all of their bank cards and any access to money and she refused to tell him where she went. Sometimes she would be gone for at least two days without giving him access to money for food and other necessities for him and their pets. Eventually, she started telling her friends and family that he was abusing her. She tried to convince as many people in our family as well. The way she behaved when he didn’t do exactly as she said raised massive red flags. Family members and friends also were seeing signs that she was physically abusing him too. The last straw was when she blew up at him for an unbelievably trivial matter and he left the house to see his parents and look into making arrangements. While he was there, she and her friends had called the police on him, saying they were afraid he was going to hurt them. He was made to get only what he could carry from HIS house and he wasn’t allowed to set foot on the property for the time being. This happened in the space of five months from the time of his wedding. When they went to court for the divorce hearing, the judge made him responsible for the majority of her debts. He had been able to return to his house, but she and her friends had vandalized it. Between the separation and the hearing, she had filed police complaints, including false accusations, that the police looked into EVERY time. When he found that she had vandalized his house, the police told him there was nothing they could do. She continuously stalked him. Nothing could be legally done because the people who he has to rely on to handle the matters can’t be bothered because he’s a man. This kind of thing happens more than you might think."

As a bartender, how often do you see men try to slip something in women's drinks? What do you do? Twice. One time I caught a guy in the process of doing something with her drunk that looked odd. As I approached he actually winked and said “just trying to help her along"". I laughed like I agreed and floated to the other end of the bar where my partner for the night was and I gave her a quick run down of the plan. My partner bee lined the ladies room, found her asked how well she knew the man (2nd date) and told her what happens. She then took her to the managers office for her safety. While my partner was redirecting our guest I sent out barback to the kitchen to call the police while I smiled and buy my tongue to keep an eye on the creep. It's a small town and downtown consist of about a dozen buildings ranging three square blocks or so. Our restaurant and lounge was about center. This means the ol cop shop was only a block away. Less than 90 seconds of the call, three of our finest came through the door. Her drink never moved as I had kept an eye on it. It was placed in a lidded container for them and they bagged and tagged it. The creep was escorted out where they cuffed the dirtbag. The victim watched it all unfold on our security cameras which recorded the whole thing and was used for his conviction. I heard he plead out to a low level sex charge not sure what but it required him to register. About a week later two young ladies, 15 or 16 years old came in with the female customer. My partner and I got huge hugs and they go free Shirley Temples and wings. The second occurrence I didn't see but three of my customers sitting across the U shaped bar did. They told me what they saw and I said I would call the police but they said wait a few minutes because they wanted to make sure they were right. They were regulars, all in the 50 ish a few bracket, business leaders from the area. In short, I trusted their judgement. They all approached the guy with smiling faces and told him -e really should go outside and join them for a smoke. Four men went out just as happy as can be. Even if one was a bit confused he was still happy. A few minutes later three men came back in as happy as can be. When i asked about the fourth the shruggedcand said he had an emergency call and left and then asked for 3 beers, 3 whiskeys and 3 ice packs. I explained to the lady the her companion had an emergency and left. She said thank God because she was getting creeped out and they were meeting for the first time. We never said anything about the guy because she made it clear she was never contacting him and it just seemed to be best to let it go. She became a regular and everyone got along well but still never said anything. Until about three months later one of the three told her yada, yada, yada and a year later I was bartending their wedding."

What's something your child has done that you're going to talk about forever? Raising a racist ??? When my daughter was three, we were quietly eating dinner. Out of nowhere, she announced that she thought that “Black children should go to black-children school and white children should go to white-children school.” This was 1995. Where did she get this? I asked her why and she told me how much she hated a little girl in her daycare who was black. So she came up with this idea. She hated her because she was a tattletale. So I asked the obvious question,”What did she tattle about?” Turns out my daughter pushed her off the swing. I tried repeatedly to explain to her that what she did was worse. I had only moderate success. Finally, my husband jumped in, “If black children go to black-children school, then Marquis will have to go.” ”NO! NO! She was in shock. She was in a panic. She idolized Marquis. He could find endless dangerous things to do in a playground. My daughter loved following him around, getting lots of dangerous ideas. My husband just said, “Well, he’s black,” She thought about it. She thought for a long time. She was thinking hard. Finally she said, “He’s only a little bit black.” Marquis had dark skin and dreadlocks. She never mentioned black-children schools again. I found it interesting that when she didn’t like someone, the first thing she noticed was the different race. When she liked someone, she didn’t notice the racial difference. Damn, if we all do this then we attach only bad things to people of other races. It was a disturbing incident"
"  leashing a child for safety after a close call with a car allowed normal development and alleviated parental anxiety.




","As a parent who has used a leash on their child, do you think it affected the child, developmentally?

As a parent who has used a leash on their child, do you think it affected the child, developmentally? Absolutely. I began using a leash on my son after a routine trip to the convenience store became a nightmare. He was 4. We went into the store, picked up our items, went to the counter to pay. I let go of his hand long enough to pull my wallet out of my back pocket. Before I could finish that task, he gave a delighted squeal and made a mad dash for the door. It was propped open, because it was high summer. I called him to come back — no response but giggles. I gave chase, and people actually stepped out of the way and let him run out that door — right out to the parking lot (threat enough) next to a highway (even worse). I was able to grab his ponytail seconds before he ran out in front of an oncoming semi… those fine folks cleared HIS path, but not mine. Well, he showed his thanks by biting down hard on my hand. I showed my relief by puking all over the lot. I picked him up, lugged him back into the store, retrieved the wallet I dropped, and carried my son right back home. Then I acknowledged I had only two hands, kids do really stupid things, and I took him to Walmart and bought a damn leash, which he wore when we went out until he got old enough to understand how dangerous cars and semis were. It affected him developmentally in that he got to keep developing developmentally. And it meant I could go places with him without having a death grip on his hand and panic attacks besides."
"  a family member's greed was revealed when they took advantage of their elderly relatives, looting their house before their passing.","What was the greediest thing you’ve seen a family member do?

What was the greediest thing you’ve seen a family member do? This goes back fifty years, but I will never forget it. My mother’s aunt and uncle (Annie and Homer) were married for over fifty years. They never had any biological children, but did adopt a daughter (Mary Catherine) and raised her as their own. MC grew up, got married, and moved out of state with her husband. (The parents lived in Memphis, and the daughter lived in southeastern Missouri, about a five-hour drive apart.) Being much younger, I only met the daughter a couple of times while I was growing up. She didn’t visit Memphis often. Aunt Annie fell and broke her hip in an accident in her early-80’s. She survived the fall, but lapsed into dementia and died about two years later. Mary Catherine didn’t attend the funeral. (When I asked why, none of the adults in my family would talk about it.) Uncle Homer lived another few years. His mind was sharp, but his physical health started failing. During the last year of his life, he was bedridden at home and required regular nursing visits during the day. One afternoon, Uncle Homer called our house all frantic, asking my mother to come to his house. She and I drove over, a trip that took about fifteen minutes. When we arrived, he was yelling and crying. His nurse had also arrived, but wasn’t able to calm him down. When he saw my mom, Uncle Homer told us the story: Mary Catherine and her husband had shown up, and cleaned out the house of everything they wanted. He had yelled and screamed, and had fallen out of bed trying to stop them, but they both just laughed at his efforts and took everything of value. He had gotten his gun out from the beside table, but his nurse had removed the bullets from it long beforehand. The daughter and husband left before Uncle Homer called us, so we never saw them. My grandfather had the daughter’s number in Missouri and called her that evening. She was not at all repentant and argued that the stuff she took was her just reward for putting up with her parents for decades. Apparently, she was upset because they had “lived too long.” She also let him know that she expected to get Uncle Homer’s house when he was gone. Uncle Homer didn’t call the police on his daughter, but he was clearly heartbroken after this incident. His life spark and sense of humor were gone. He lasted about three more months, and passed away at age 92. After he died, Mary Catherine didn’t attend the funeral, but did come back to deal with her inheritance. It turned out that Uncle Homer had altered his will and gave his house to his nurse, a widow who had been living in a rented place nearby. The value of the house was a lot greater than the stuff that the daughter had stolen. "

Have you ever found out your kid wasn’t yours by getting a paternity test? 
If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life? I’m going to tell you a tale about my step-daughter Sue, who did something I think is unforgivable. When she was 19 years old she worked in a retail store with a married man named Rick, she was dating a man named Mike. This was during her first year of college. She cheated on Mike with Rick and got pregnant. Her and Rick made the decision not to break up Rick’s marriage so she told Mike it was his child. Between the two, Mike was the better catch financially as he had a superior job, and owned a nice home. So, Mike, being an honorable man, did the right thing and he married her. He love the child, and he loved Sue with all his heart. She on the other hand always held a candle for Rick. And after 6 years of marriage she began a second affair with Rick, and asked Mike for a divorce. By this time she had her name of all of poor Mikes assets and in the divorce got half his house. Then her and Rick moved in together and she got a thousand dollars a month in child-support for six year old junior. Her and Rick lived high on the hog, they ate out 3 nights a week, went on vacations, they each owned brand new cars. She has a good job, Rick not so much. Then after 6 years, she got a new job and it required her to move across the country. She was about to move away and continue taking Mike’s $1,000 mo. with her. Well, her best girl-friend had a heart and felt bad for the poor guy. Who drove an old beat up rusty car, and was clearly not living as high as Sue & Rick. So she went and spilled the beans to Mike and told him that the now 12 year old child was not his, but was Ricks! Mike took a paternity test and it proved the friends words true. He went to court and got the child support discontinued. He still loved Sue so he never outed her or shamed her. Everyone still thinks the child is his, and Rick is the step-father. He is still in the child’s life as if nothing changed, he loves the child as if he were his own. He never brought up the six years of child-support he paid after the divorce for a child that was not his ~ $72,000.00 she and Rick took from him. He’s such a good man. Too good! Oh, but Grandpa & Grandma are NOT HAPPY with what transpired! So, they are going to make sure justice prevails in this situation. So, they modified their will to state that when Sue receives her piece of their estate, she must pay Mike $72,000.00 off the top of her money (even if that means she get zero). The ironic part is, she doesn’t even realize they know about the true paternity of their grandchild. Sue thinks it’s all under wraps."
"  a new student, facing prejudice, impresses teacher with a perfect quiz score, wipes the smirk off the mocking girl's face.","What’s the fastest you’ve wiped a smirk off of someone’s face?

It was my freshman year of high school. My parents had just recently divorced and my mom, siblings, and I moved to a small town in upstate Pennsylvania. It was difficult enough dealing with family dynamics, let alone moving to a new town where I didn’t know anyone. During my first week at my new high school, I was trying to learn my way around all the classes and get familiar with the teachers. Most of the kids had known each other for years. They had grown up together. I wasn’t one of them. I was an outsider with a weird accent, and different style. Some kids were very kind and welcoming. Others were cruel, unkind, and very stuck-up. I just so happened to sit in front of a girl who was one of the stuck-up kind. It was English class. It was also the only empty seat in the whole room. The teacher asked me to introduce myself and share where I was from. So, I did. After I finished, we were told that there would be a pop quiz in the class. The teacher asked me to take it so she could gauge where I was at in my comprehension of English sentence structure, etc. As the teacher was handing out the quiz papers, the girl sitting behind me that I had mentioned earlier, tapped me on the shoulder. I turned around to look at her. She leaned in and said, “Special-Ed is down the hall,” and smirked the whole time she was saying it. I just looked at her for a second, blinked, and then turned around. I was slightly irritated. This girl had no idea who I was, yet had already made up her mind about who I was…and wasn’t. Yep, I was fully irritated at that point. I filled out the quiz. Once it was completed, I handed it in for immediate grading. The teacher handed all the quizzes back with our letter grade/percentage. She then said, “There was only one student in the whole class who got a 100% on the quiz. Do you want to know who that is? It’s the new student.” She looked at me and said, “Congratulations! Now if everyone else would do that well on the next quiz.” I turned around and looked at the girl behind me. I paused for a moment and then smiled and said, “Remember, Special-Ed is down the hall.” The smirk on her face disappeared in a flash. She didn’t say a word. That felt so good!"
"  differentiating between accidental and intentional touch, she emphasizes the need to recognize cues and respond accordingly, advocating for boundaries.","How do you respond to an inappropriate ""accidental touch"" by someone at work?

I’m going to answer this from a unique perspective. First question: was it actually accidental? You can tell the difference by if the person recoils upon touching you or if they explore more. It’s a very obvious tactile difference. This is especially true in Blind and DeafBlind circles, where some Blind or DeafBlind creeps think they can use their blindness as an excuse. Nope. The difference between touch-and-recoil versus touch-and-explore/grope is unmistakable. Every blind person has had an accident at one time or another. Appropriate blind people, as soon as they realize what they’re touching, and that it’s a private area, will immediately draw their hand back and will usually react with embarrassment and apologize. For example, one time I was sitting using Tactile ASL interpreters in class. We were seated and my interpreter was seated to my right. Class was wrapping up and I didn’t realize my interpreter had already stood up when I went to reach for his hand to ask something, so I ended up actually touching his crotch. I immediately recoiled, felt terrible, apologized profusely, we laughed it off, and moved on. Inappropriate blind people touch…and then their hand keeps moving…and exploring more, even though they know exactly what they’re touching. That is just as inappropriate as a handsy sighted person. There’s no recoil. There’s no embarrassment. There’s no apology, or the apology is obviously delayed and fake, after they’ve gotten in a good grope. There is often also an obvious ignoring of other cues. For example, I used to have a hearing Blind coworker who would ignore every audio cue indicating where I was standing such as the location of my voice and footsteps, and would quote-unquote “accidentally” run into me. In every other context, his sound location skills were excellent. Yet he would run into me over and over. That’s the other cue—if it happens repeatedly. Sighted folks, this is the oldest, tiredest excuse in the Blind community. Don’t fall for it. With sighted people, I can also tell when someone is touching me by accident versus when they are touching me on purpose. There is a different feel in their hand, the way the muscles in their hand move, how their hand travels and contours my body. Plus, to touch a private area, there really has to be an intentional reach. There’s really no way you “accidentally” touch someone’s crotch or chest when you can see to avoid the area. Now there are times when it is truly accidental. For example, in DeafBlind culture, there is something called ProTactile, where you convey emotion, expression, grammar, and spatial meaning by drawing on the person’s body instead of in midair as with visual signing. One time I was standing face-to-face with a DeafBlind client, and he was using ProTactile to confirm the route to the bathroom. Because we were standing face-to-face, the easiest place to “map” was on the front part of my shoulder. Part of his map got a bit close to my chest. He obviously noticed the change from bonier musculature to softer tissue. As soon as he realized, he felt terrible and apologized. Because he was genuinely just trying to communicate, and he was very apologetic and said he hoped he didn’t make me uncomfortable, I knew nothing was meant by it. Again, there is a different feel in the hands. He was obviously focused on drawing the route and wasn’t trying to squeeze in a grope. I generally don’t like to touch or be touched by hearing-sighted coworkers, accidental or not. The only time I make contact with hearing-sighted coworkers is if they want to show me something (like a new haircut) or if I need to take human guide (that means a blind person holding onto another person’s elbow to be guided in an unfamiliar, noisy, or crowded environment). I’ve had some coworkers and supervisors put their hand on my shoulder though, for purely non-linguistic reasons, and it feels patronizing and condescending to me. The people who do this always seem to do it from behind as well, which feels even more like a power-play. Accidental or not, I don’t like it and I ask them not to touch me."
"  despite initially not wanting children, the husband selflessly embraced fatherhood to provide a loving home for his wife's orphaned nieces.","How would the relationship be between a father and his child, if the father never wanted children in the first place?

My husband didn’t want children, he was clear and unambiguous. He did not want children. One of my attractions for him was that I couldn’t have children. We had been married about 3 years when my brother and his wife died in an accident leaving a toddler and an infant, I didn’t expect he would want to raise them and I didn’t mention the possibility to him. He knew I wouldn’t be happy if they were raised separated in foster care so on the way home from the funeral I was surprised to hear him say. “So we will be parents.” I asked him why, He said First I do it because I love you and you will not be happy if they are sent to foster care and separated. Second I am an adult they are helpless kids. They need parents more than I need my dreams now. He has been the best possible father in the world. He spent time with them, cared for them, cooked for them, did laundry for them read them to sleep, helped with their homework and taught them how to be adults. He grew to love them dearly and they love him as their father. He delayed his dreams of us traveling till they grew up. I love them and they love me but my husband set aside what he wanted so they could have a loving caring home and he has 2 devoted and loving children."
  how compassion and a broad understanding of the world are signs of high intelligence that go beyond specific talents or IQ scores.,"What is a sign of high intelligence that not many people know about?

Compassion. Now that may not be the expected answer. You may think mathematical ability, business acumen, all sorts of other far more materialistic things. But they may be signs of specific intelligence, mathematical intelligence, but true, high intelligence means that you have, and continue to develop your understanding of things in an ever widening picture. The more stupid a person is, the more base and primitive their brain, the more likely you are to see the juvenile characteristics of hate, fear, selfishness, basically the worst characteristics. That is because although they may have a talent in one particular area, they are not Grand thinkers. We have developed over many decades or centuries depending on your point of view a very materialistic way of thinking. If you own a Porsche you must be smart, if you own a Bugatti you must be really really smart. Okay I'm simplifying things but we do tend to equate a great deal of worth with possession. So the answer to this very valid question is to look for those people who are not trapped by the mundanity of showing off, of bragging. As an aside I would also include that IQ has very little to do with intelligence. People will take online tests and call themselves a genius which is just not accurate. Even when people take meticulously controlled tests like what Mensa offers, they leap up and say look at me I is a genius LOL. And IQ test only tells how good you are at solving certain types of puzzles. It does not measure how artistic or creative you are, your compassion or understanding or how well you can sing. I think it was Koko the gorilla who've been given an IQ test did poorly. One of the questions was in a storm where should you go. In a field. In a tree. In a house. Of course to the gorilla, the tree was the right answer. To the humans giving the test, it was not. I can't remember who said it but I believe it was judging a person by their mathematical ability is like judging a fish by how well it can climb a tree. To show your intelligence you would need to be able to display a wider understanding of the world. A greater comprehension of The human condition and a wiser Outlook on the future. Without these things you may be clever. You may be mathematically or economically astute, but you are no genius"
"  best friends have a night of passionate intimacy, but it ruins their friendship. She ghosted him and started a new life.","What Happened When You Finally Had Intercourse with Your Best Friend? 

It ruined everything. We don’t talk anymore. I’m a gay man with a girl best friend (since highschool). I broke up with my boyfriend who was cheating on me and occasionally physically hurts me in public. She was finally separated from her toxic husband who also beat her up. I had a fist fight with this dude one time and he hates my guts and forbids her from seeing me. She became a single mom and she was barely having any intercourse with anyone at that time because of juggling work and taking care of her daughter. One night, she was insisting on sleeping over at my place. Since her kid was at her parents’ and she didn’t wanna be alone. I was like yeah sure. Cool. We ordered dinner, watched FRIENDS, looked at our HS yearbook, reminisced, and had wine. Probably more than we were supposed to. When it was time for bed, I told her that she can sleep on my bed. And I’ll just sleep on the couch like always. But for some reason she was very persistent in making me sleep on the same bed as it “had enough room” and I eventually agreed. She played footsies under the sheets with me on my bed. It was kind of awkward at first cause I wasn’t responding and pretending to sleep. But her hands were hovering on my chest and going down to my crotch and into my sweat pants. I don’t know if it was the alcohol, her hands traveling to the base of my meat, or what… but she looked so pretty when I glanced at her and she just let out this naughty but horny smile. Idk. I caved in and kissed her. We just made out so much then one thing led to another and we had intercourse. It was actually good. We kept hanging out for a few more weeks and I was developing some feelings for her. I asked her if she wanted to give it a try. I even thought to myself, I’ll be fully ready to take care of her and her toddler if it worked out but when I poured my heart out and confessed to her, she just ghosted me. I was crying for a month. Found out she has a new husband now and a second kid. They also transferred to my city. And lives on the street next to mine."

","What Story Made You Realize Life Wasn’t Real? 

two weeks ago, I was about to get ready for a party at six. Just before I started getting ready, one of my friends messaged me, super excited because a boy she's had a crush on for the last four years finally asked her out, and he was coming with her to the party. While I was texting her back, my younger brother walked into my room and asked if I could drive him to his friend's house, which I agreed to do. Then I went to the bathroom to have a shower and do my makeup. So I got in the shower, but when I went to wash my hair I realized that my conditioner was finished. I was pretty ticked off, because I'd only bought it a couple of days beforehand and it's an expensive brand (my younger sister always uses up my things, so I knew she'd used it all). She'd also trashed the bathroom, leaving water everywhere and her dirty towel on the floor. I was pissed off, and was about to get out of the shower in order to tell her off and get some more conditioner. But as I went to get out, I realized at the last second that she'd kicked the grippy mat we have at the bottom of our shower-tub up (our shower/tub is SUPER slippery without the grip mat). So as I went to step out, my foot slipped and I fell with my neck down onto the edge of my tub. Time seemed to slow down in my head, and I remember my last thought was ""Wow, this is how I die? How stupid."" But here's the thing- at the moment of ""impact,"" I woke up in a start, back in my bed. I know it sounds stupid and cheesy, like something from a dumb netflix show, but there's literally no other way to describe what happened. I was lying in bed right before I got up to shower the ""first"" time, but I don't remember falling asleep. And the thing is, I've been a lucid dreamer for the last five or so years, and if this was a dream, it was way more vivid than anything I've ever experienced. What weirded me out though, was that the exact same friend who texted me the first time messaged me after I woke up to tell me that the boy she had a crush on had asked another girl out, and she was pretty bummed about it and didn't want to come to the party. I was weirded out that there was some similarity between that and the ""dream,"" but didn't think much of it at first. As I went to reply, my younger brother came in to ask if I would take him to his friend's house. All the blood drained from my face. He just stood in the doorway looking confused, and asked me what was wrong. I rushed into the bathroom, feeling like I was losing my mind, and went to check the conditioner bottle. I know this sounds completely crazy, but the bottle was finished just like before. And the grip mat was kicked up. At that point I went to lie back down in bed and texted my friends to tell them that I wouldn't be going to the party."
"  friends plan to smoke zaza, but encounter obstacles. They end up with unexpected amounts, causing hilarious chaos and consequences.","Today I screwed up by smoking zaza at my friends house. 

Me and my good friend have really wanted to try smoking zaza. Me and him both live on an acreage where we live about a 3 min drive away from each other, we invited another friend that was supposed to bring a dab pen to his house. I came around noon and hung out playing videos games and talking about girls, around 5:00pm the other friend shows. We all get hyped knowing we’re about to get high all for the first time. This mf waited to get here to tell us he didn’t have a dab pen. Our goal was crushed and then we started thinking of a plan. We all texted for people who knew people (plugs) for some tree. This took about until 9:00pm for someone willing to actually deliver. We put our money on the table to buy some “mint kush” this shit sounds fireee. We ended up getting our money ready to go buy from this guy, we walk 0.5km down his road to some mailbox to meet this drug dealer. It was probably -10C° and we were waiting about 20 mins because the stupid plug had to fill up his gas and get all the way out to the country . Finally he gets here and asks for the money, we pay $80 for what we expect are “mint edibles” and this guy hands us an ounce and 1/2 of zaza. We just wanted enough to get high for the night We start walking back with this big ass bag in my hoodie pocket and i smell like effing Jamaica. We finally arrive to his house and we decide to bury the zaza in the back yard behind a certain tree. My friend was like “why wont I just call my cousin up, we have hella zaza anyway?” So we all agreed but thats the part that effed us up. The friend that arrived before me got impatient waiting for my friends mom to go to sleep so he took a xanax. None of us knew this kid was addicted to xans and he just fell asleep COLD. For the next hour we kinda effed around with him like stacking oreos on his head and then slapping him with pizza, we ended up drawing the angry german painter stache on him as well. Once my friend’s cousin arrives we leave the kid barred out on the bed and get ready to smoke some good good. Im talking this shit was orange, sticky, and loud. Im sitting in the window rolling up effing up, rolling up effing up (keep in mind this is my first time doing this) then once we had 3 ugly looking joints we all went to the trees and lit up. Well thats what i thought. My friends dumbass cousin was chiefing that thing into the window, he had the joint hanging out of his mouth like he was effing popeye. To be fair this stuff was LOUD so pretty much the whole 8 acres he had stunk. After a couple minutes i finish mine and im absolutely ZOOTED. Me and my friend both go to put ours out and get inside, while im halfway through his window i see the light turn on in the window above my head and then loud ass stomping (keep in mind my friend lives in the basement and his room is right under his moms room). I kid you not i swear his mom assassin creed jumps down the set of stairs and sprints to his door. My friends cousin is sitting in corner of the house outside repeating “im so effed im so effed”. My ass is so faded im crouch sitting in his window cill like im spider man and then just slowly fall back (his window is like 5ft of the ground and everything underneath is sharp rocks) I get up then I bolt to the trees and watch from a distance. Eventually I came back inside and the kid that was barred out finally woke up from the couch, came into his room and said “you guys are so effing stupid” did like a spinning dive onto the bed when his mom was giving us all shit. We all start crying laughing as he instantly starts sleeping after some acrobatic shit. 30 mins later his mom comes back down and says “so boys hows the high” i make eye contact and just start geeking, im still staring at her while im moving around playing rainbow six siege on the playstation just laughing in her face just in my own reality. That night there was 4 different moods, me absolutely blasted and laughing, my friend staring at the wall in regret, my friends friend shlumped on the bed, and my friends cousin crying because his rich mom will guarantee take his phone away for a week."
"  a victim of long-term bullying seeks revenge on tormentors through elaborate pranks, including damaging property and personal humiliation.","Guys bully me for years. I get some revenge in a way you’ve NEVER seen before. 

This is the one time I felt proud of myself in my life. Let me set the stage, The revenge happened about 5 years ago. I came from a well-off family. We weren’t rich but we weren’t poor. Well, when I was 8 my dad died in a car accident from a truck driver who ran a red light. My mom ended up having to work as a part-time escort just for a little extra cash to keep me and my sister alive. Me and my little sister ended up moving schools because she got expelled for attacking a kid. She had autism and sometimes she gets mad to the point of violence. At the new school, I immediately started getting bullied for being a trap. I was tormented by this one group of kids constantly for 7 years. They mocked my sister for being autistic and said that “I'm probably gonna follow in my mom’s footsteps of sucking meat for money”. Everyday it was non-stop torment. In my senior year of high-school, I had had enough. I enacted my revenge during the last month of school. The months prior to this I had been studying up on their schedules. Where they go after school, when they leave, when they arrive, where they live, etc. It was very stalker-y but idk fam. Then, after countless stalking and planning, I was ready. First off, some minuscule things. I poked simple holes all around there water bottles so when they opened them it leaked everywhere. I unscrewed their desk legs to make their desks break even from slight pressure. I did everything I could to agitate them. Then I went onto bigger things. I’d spray coyote urine on their stuff and then filled them with animal shit. I wrecked their stuff beyond comprehension. They did worse to me throughout my life and they deserved it. Now here’s where it gets really, well, illegal. They all play baseball together, so I decided to hit them there. They went to baseball practice, and I followed behind them. They left the locker room and I went in there and did some practice of my own. I brought a machete and went to town. Their bags were ripped to shreds. 3 of the 7 had wood baseball bats, so I destroyed those. I also set up a trap for them, when they opened their bags a M-80 would ignite. I put a metric tonne of river clay in their car transmissions and set up beds of nails in front of their tires. I wanted them to suffer. Here’s where it’s really illegal. I went to the main bully’s house. He is an asshole. He purposefully dislocated my shoulder for no reason once. He’s the one that said the thing about my following my mom’s footsteps. He’s pissed on me, he’s assaulted me. He broke me, and I was gonna get my revenge. I waited for him to leave home and broke in. I crawled into his window and started having some fun. I disassembled his bed and computer. I moved a bunch of stuff in their house around, I turned on all the lights, all the burners, the showers, sinks, everything. I busted massive holes in their walls. I made a craigslist ad advertising free butt stuff for a “petite gay guy” and put his address and phone number. I opened a bunch of gay spicy vids and viruses onto his computer. I changed all their passwords, even their internet password. To top it all off, I followed a lesson from my idol, The PB. I went up to his room, took some laxatives, and coated his room in shit and piss. I wiped myself up, crawled back out and left. I left no trace of it being me in there, but I’m guessing he knew. I overheard that the utility bill was extremely high and that he couldn’t sleep in his room. He started failing at a high rate, turns out he figured out it was me, attacked me and got expelled. I don’t know if I was in the right to do all of what I did, but I was proud and still am."
  a vengeful mother seeks revenge on her daughter's cheating ex-boyfriend by sabotaging his scholarship exam with laxative-laced brownies.,"Cheat on my daughter, how about I make you fail the most important exam of your life 

Five years ago, my daughter, Allison started dating her now ex, Chris. They seemed happy together, and I started to like him. However, they slowly started to drift apart, and he started acting distant to her. Allison would sometimes come to me crying that they barely spoke anymore. Eventually Allison discovered that Chris was cheating on her. My first boyfriend cheated on me, so I know how terrible it feels to be cheated on. She called me crying, because after she confronted him, he yelled at her, and called her a beach. Chris came over to my house and tried to spin a line of bullshit about how Allison was crazy, and was cheating on him, but she already called me and showed me screenshots of his conversations with other girls. This was where I got an idea to give him what he deserves. He decided to waste years of my daughter's life and make her cry, so I decided to do the same to him. I pretended I was on his side, and reassured him that Allison was being unreasonable. After he left, I told Allison my plan and she was all in. Chris went to a really good college on a $40,000 scholarship. He was all set to graduate college with a great degree, no debt, and a very high paying job. In order to renew this scholarship, he had to pass this exam to renew his scholarship. One thing to know about Chris was that he loved food. He was six foot two, and I've seen him eat enormous amounts of food. And I was a good cook, and he loved my food, especially my brownies. So the day before the exam I baked him brownies. Unfortunately for him they were laced with a box of laxatives. I also put laxatives in his coffee. The next morning he drinks his coffee and eats half of the brownies I made. I'd say he ingested about twenty doses. As if that wasn't enough, he took several more brownies to eat on the way to the exam. He ended up failing the exam, and couldn't afford to go to college. Apparently he got super ill and had to go to the bathroom several times during the exam. I decided to gift him the rest of the brownies as a present in order to ""make him feel better"". He probably had diarrhea throughout the rest of the week. Failing this exam completely changed the trajectory of his life. He was going to go get a degree at a prestigious university, but now he has a low paying job working minimum wage."
"  man discovers girlfriend's infidelity, seeks revenge by intentionally infecting her with HIV through a paid accomplice.","Cheating on me? Get HIV then

This is not my story. I just saw this on Facebook and though this might fits here. So this story belongs to a Chinese man, I just translate it. English is not my first language so please be kind to me. I'll put the Facebook link down below in the comment section. ""I've suffer for at least 6 months, finally I can push her into the darkest pit of hell. It's a long story, so let me light up a cigarette and tell you all about it. I met my girlfriend when we were on a same vacation tour back in 2006. The first time ours eyes met, I've made a promise to myself that I have to make her my girlfriend. The process wasn't hard by any mean, I just poured my truest, deepest love out to her, to make her moved by my true feelings. I loved her, I truly, really loved her. But due to my job, I had to travel a lot. Sometimes I would be away from home for 15 days to a month. About 6 months ago, I noticed she had been showing signs of a cheater. She's always tried to hide away from me when she was on her phone, either if she was texting or calling someone. I just lay my eyes on her phone and she would turn it off. I can almost confirmed that she was cheating but I didn't have any kind of evidence. I have an email account that had been login in for a good while but rarely use, and then one day there were hotel bills sent to this email. I checked the emails and some other things and found out there were some note lines about the bills. After that there was nothing left to clarify. But one man's soul can't truly die when he haven't dead, me and some friends had found out about the man she had been fricking with and the hotel's location. The first thing I felt when her cheating on me was confirmed was anger. I was furious, not a bit of heart-breaking. It is the feeling when you wanted someone to die, gone, disappeared. I wanted her to suffer and die. So reality has proved that money can solve anything. I found the way to contact the other man, his wechat, (it's like Facebook for Chinese) to be exact. I have friends that really, really talented, smart people, if I could tell. I made friend with a doctor back in August last year. I told him my story and what was my plan, also sprinkled in a bit of ""You can have benefit out of this too, of course I'll pay the money"". He made up his mind for a few days and then gave me contacts of some female patients that have HIV (there was no mention about the strict policy in the hospital about patient's privacy). Out of 3 patients I've met, only one agree. Most of the ones who have HIV haven't had a ""clean"" life. When you have the money, you really can control the devil himself. I gave her the other man's contact and an amount of ""fee"", and required her in the shortest time she could, give him HIV. This modern life make it really easy for a woman to sleep with a man, it only took her 5 days. I worried that only one night wasn't enough for him to have HIV, so I asked her to be his FWB for a while, and gave her 15.000 yuan (~2150 USD) My girlfriend still haven't known anything. She did really fall for him. I knew it since reading her texts. About 2 weeks before Tet, she had a fever. A terrible, agonizing fever. I knew she already had HIV (We did had intercourse but I had my rubber on). I told her to go to the hospital but due to my job, I had to be away for several days so I couldn't cut it to the hospital with her. I would pay a fortune to see her face when she found out about the HIV tho. After 2 days I went home and saw her being upset and all, and then after asking my friend at the hospital, it is confirmed that she has HIV. I.was.ecstatic. But I played it cool, I was the dumb boyfriend that haven't know anything (she didn't know that I already got the info about her HIV) . We're still being together for now. I want to witness with my own eyes her being slowly dying on the hospital bed. That's all, if there's anything happened I'll tell you later."" "
  dad seeks revenge on a gang that beat him up by plotting and executing a brutal retaliation with cleverly crafted tools.,"In the 70s a gang beat up my dad and put him in the hospital. So he got revenge on all of them 

This isn't my story, but rather my dad's. I know the believability of this might be hard. But I believe this story to be true. My dad was a very nice and hard working man with some of the greatest patience for bullshit I've ever seen. But he also had a temper that could make an angry moose turn the other way if he was pushed far enough. Well when this happened he was definitely pushed far enough. He told this to me after I told him all of the things I did to prank Evil Mamabear before moving out of her house. He told me this story once and only once about ten years ago and never spoke of it again. I wrote it down in a journal from memory back then so I wouldn't forget. So I'll try and retell it as best as I can from what I wrote in the journal a decade ago. And if any of you thought my revenge streak I did on my mother before moving out was too much with the gnomes and laxative, what my father did was much more brutal. And probably explains where I got my conniving side from. This story happened in the late 70s. My dad was a young man striking out on his own for the first time. He lived alone in a really crappy part of town while attending college and working at a gas station as a steady job. But the area had lots of thugs, and lots of violence. There was a group of guys he knew from highschool that just loved to mess with him. The first thing they did was spray paint graffiti all over his car (A 68 Chevy Nova). Then they started harassing him every night he was coming home from work or class because they were always hanging around his building. The leader of the gang was a big guy dad referred to as Ted. (Don't know if this was his real name or not) Ted was a relentless bully to several other kids in school. He beat up my dad many times over the years. But in high school in particular he hated my dad because Ted failed and dropped out during senior year since they wouldn't let him play football with his failing grades anymore. My dad on the other hand finished with some pretty decent grades and got a partial scholarship to a local community college. So to say Ted resented my dad was putting it mildly. And one day when my dad was going into his apartment, Ted and his gang ambushed him and beat him terribly in a back alley. My dad laid bloody and unconscious in that alley all night. He was found in the morning by an old lady walking her dog and she called for help. He was in the hospital for months with several broken bones and head trauma. And this caused him to lose out on a lot of his college classes and he had to retake them. Of course he told police it was Ted and his cronies that beat him up. But the police weren't very good at their jobs. And claimed they had no evidence that Ted did it because he and his friends all supposedly had alibies and there were no other witnesses. Well that didn't sit well with my dad. He spent some time in physical recovery after getting out of the hospital and then moved to a new apartment with a friend as a roommate. And together they plotted his revenge on Ted. My dad told me that back then if police failed you, then you took payback into your own hands. Now a thing of note is that my grandfather on my dad's side worked at the city dump. And he was always bringing things home to collect, donate, fix, resell, etc. My dad helped him out with this a lot. So he learned a lot about fixing and making things. And while with his father at work he found ways of sneaking into the dump at night. And as a teenager he would sneak in there at night with friends to find stuff they used to build a hidden fort in the woods nearby. My dad said the fort was so well made that it even had a makeshift wood stove that they made out of recycled bricks and a metal barrel to use in winter to keep the fort warm. This is important later. So over a few nights my dad and his friend snuck into the dump just like they used to in order to look around for things they could use. Bit by bit they found some old stinky clothes, shoes, and some old wooden baseball bats, and a few other useful things for the revenge. The dump also had an assortment of used tools the employees found in the trash and set aside to be used on site, but also regularly borrowed. So no one really kept track of them. My dad and his friend kept all of the stuff they were going to use hidden at the old fort they made as teenagers near the dump. So they had a perfect place to build the tools of their revenge. Next they made sure they had as solid of an alibi as they could make. "

I wasn't going to take it but I also wasn't going to get into a punch up because I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of getting me angry, and right at that moment I overheard the perfect thing, he was bragging to his friends about the house party he was having and saying about all the substance he was going to take to the party, and said he had it all in his car, it wasn't just a bit of zaza either if I remember correctly he said he had 13 bags of coke about 30 pills of mdma and 7 or 8 of grams of ketamine, and then I knew what I would do for my revenge on the guy as he was leaving I followed him to his car and took a photo of his number plate, then after he was driving off I walked off and called the police I knew they needed something more than hearsay to stop the car especially because I didn't want to be traced back to it so I told the police I saw my bully snorting a white powder in the Pub toilets (this was a complete fabrication) and then get into the drivers side of the car I then provided them with the licence plate of the car and told them the direction they were heading in. I honestly didn't think they were going to stop him or maybe they would ask him questions later and ruin his party but the driving on substance allegation plus the fact he had been arrested for minor possession before (which I didn't know at the time) was enough for the police to take it seriously, and stop and search his car, which they found all the substance he was transporting to his party, and he got arrested for it. the consequences of his arrest meant he lost out on his university place, his rich parents had enough of his behaviour so kicked him out and cut him off from their funds. and a rumour I heard was that in turn for a lower sentence my bully ratted out his supplier. Which resulted in him getting stabbed multiple times and as a consequence of that."
"  a Target harassment incident: Mistaken for a preteen, person confronts girls, involves employees, contacts parents, exposes them on social media, receives apologies.","Mistake me for a preteen and Try to Bully me at Target? I'll squeal on you to your moms & coach. 

To preface, I am a really short and skinny 20 something who could pass for a 12 year old easy. This is relevant I promise. A while back when this happened I was at Target with my younger sister waiting for our nail appointment. Normal day sister bonding stuff. I think it was 30 minutes in, when we found some ugly jackets in the menswear section and started trying them on for fun. Next thing I know, 3 girls in volley ball uniform surround us. First thing I notice is 2 of the 3 girls were filming us while one girl is asking rapid fire questions while holding a jacket up. I was so surprised and sort of speechless. My sister was also sort of stunned and silent the whole time. Rando girl: Hey, do you think this looks good on me? (holds a jacket up) haunter_4_hanter: Sure... I guess Rando girl: Really?! haunter_4_hanter: ...yes? Rando girl: Okay. Buy it for me. haunter_4_hanter: .... Are you serious? Rando girl: You said you thought it looked good. Buy it for me. haunter_4_hanter: …no We sort of went back and forth of me saying no and her insisting I buy her the jacket. Her friends filming also pitched in saying I should buy her the jacket and saying if I dont buy her the jacket than I lied about it looking good on her. (What? Can someone explain to me why they did this, is this some sort of social media prank?) At the same time, I am slowly walking out of the menswear section and pushing my sister trying to get away. I could see my little sister was super uncomfortable and I know she is kind of shy so this is really mortifying for her. That made me angry. It also occurred to me that they must think I'm some sort of preteen like them because I can't fathom these type of kids bothering anybody with an single hair of puberty. Honestly, they were all pudgy little asshole 10 year olds. Meanwhile, i'm wearing my crooked glasses, messy jeans and a YMCA summer camp shirt (idk why I even own this t-shirt since I never went to their summer camp). My little sister is also wearing her Middle School Track shirt, so both of us look like kids. Kids like them. In my most grown ass voice I could muster I say, ""What. The. eff. Are. You. poops. Doing? I'm 20+ years old. Do you think this is funny? What the eff is wrong with you kids? Where's your moms?"" In my best 'I need to speak to a manager voice' I ask my sister, ""Go find an employee."" My sister takes off running. This is were the girls stop laughing and start telling me to chill out and its just a prank which only makes me angrier. I go in on them about how so stupid they're being and how harassing strangers is decidedly NOT funny. I throw in some choice swear words and I can hear my crazy voice getting higher and angrier. I pull my phone out and start recording them and laughing manically saying, ""Think this is funny?! HA HA HA"" I think this is were they started getting worried because they took off. I tried following them, but then then a employee following my sister appeared. I go on to explain how we were shopping and suddenly harassed by these three girls trying to force us to buy them things and filming us. I think I also tear up and the employee radios his manager. I repeat my story and show them the photos I took of little poops, sans my crazy video. Next thing I know those asshole kids are rounded up and surrounded by a couple employees and a really annoyed Mom. I walk past and tell them to 'eff OFF' and drag my sister to our nail appointment. But I wasn't done. They were wearing bright yellow volleyball jerseys with their club names. I google and find said club and blast any email I can find. I also message their Facebook. BUT, I'm still not done. I go on social media and stalk through their photos. I find the club's Instagram and after some work, I find their friends who have tagged some moms. Through those moms I find their moms. I cross reference facebook and see the girls parents with pictures of their families. I confirm the faces of the little assholes. I blast their social media with my 'disappointed and upset grown up voice'. I include their pictures. I also find the Mom who was chaperoning the kids and I blast her too. I wait. Within Hours I have a reply from the director of the volleyball club and replies from two of the parents. The Mom who was chaperoning funnily enough blocked me. I never got a direct apology from those poops, but I hope having a stranger hunting them down and contacting people from their lives scared them straight. To top it off, I posted a glowing review of the Target on how they handled the situation with little poop's faces. A week later, one of the dad's asks me to take it down, so I oblige. He asked very nicely. Lesson, Don't be little poops to people."
"  wrong-number GED test seekers receive false information from the office, leading them to show up unprepared and cause chaos.




","10 dollars and a pencil. That’s All It Takes For Any Of Us To Snap.

 A post I made in another subreddit reminded me of this one. Enjoy. A few years ago, after changing jobs, I found myself in a new office, with a new phone number. After some orientation, training and other new-hire stuff, I finally get to sit down and do the things. I get my voice-mail and answering machine set up, set up the email, and the phone rings. ""Good morning, <railroad> engineering."" ""Yeah, when can I take the GED test?"" ""Sorry, wrong number."" <click> Rings again ""Seriously, when can I take the GED test?"" ""Like I said, wrong number. Bye."" This went on for weeks. 15-20 calls a day. People screaming at me for not being the adult Learning center. One day, an epiphany: ""This isn't the Adult Learning Center?"" ""Nope"" ""Do you know the number?"" ""Check Google"" ""I did, this is the number on their website."" Oh really? A little Google-fu of my own, and I dig up a few numbers, and give them a call. They tell me that they don't maintain their website, and there's nothing they can do about it, and it's not their problem. I'm just going to have to ""deal with it"". My favorite line of that conversation was ""What are you going to do about it? I work for the State. You can't do <naughty word>. Bye bye."" And you can imagine that ""bye-bye"" just dripped with the condescension that only hubris and decades of Karenhood can muster. Oh. Hell. No. Let's dance. The next day. ""Good morning <railroad>"" ""When can I take the GED test?"" We give that on request, it takes about an hour and a half. Come on down."" ""Oh, awesome. How much it it?"" ""10 dollars. Bring a pencil. We'll sharpen yours, but we can't supply them. Budget cuts, you know."" ""Naw, I get it. See you in a bit."" ""Take your time. They don't like me telling you this, but if you get here before we close, they HAVE TO give you the test. See you when you get here."" ""Thanks, man. See you later."" Now for those of you who don't know, the GED test takes a WHOLE <NAUGHTY> DAY. It also usually costs upward of $100, depending on the state. In the state I was living and working at the time, it was around $200. As such, it was only offered at certain intervals. So, as I was telling dozens of people PER DAY that it was $10, took 90 minutes, and offered on request, I'm sure that they were absolutely inundated with angry people with freshly sharpened #2 pencils, waving their $10 bills, and demanding the test that the guy on the phone told them they could come and take. Every morning, I checked the website, to see if my phone number was still on there. I also took the liberty of crawling around and getting the phone numbers for some managers. I was happy to hand these out when people called back to complain that they hadn't been allowed to take the test. ""Head back down there, and ask to speak to <random director> and tell them that they called the number on the website and this is what they were told. It took them about 6 more weeks to change the website. For some reason, all of the managers numbers disappeared from the website as well."
"  neighbour repeatedly disregards driveway boundaries, prompting revenge from homeowner who strategically sets up a frozen obstacle, resulting in car damage.","Revenge is best served frozen

We don't own a car and live at the end of a cul-de-sac. I have people use my driveway all the time to turn around. It's not a huge deal to me, a little annoying when they compact the snow and it's harder to shovel but whatever.One of my neighbours had a ride service come pick up their child every day. The van would park in my spot and begin honking at like 8am (I worked nights at the time). half the time he'd be half parked on my grass. I told my neighbour that i don't overly mind my spot being used but not if he's going to honk like that every morning and especially not if he's going to drive over what little lawn i have every time. She spoke with him, he ignored it. I spoke with him and got ""what's your problem man, it's not like you're using it."" to which i repeated that i don't mind him using it if he stays off my grass and doesn't honk every morning. Apparently suggesting he wait till the kid notices he's there or, god forbid, he have to drag his ass out of the car to knock on a door was just ridiculous and inhumane of me. So i left a recycle bin at the foot of my driveway. He just ran over it. I called the dispatch for the ride service and was told they are sub contractors and technically self employed but they will pass along the message. I wake up the next day to pounding on my door. Dude is pissed! him - ""How dare you call my boss you stupid piece of shit! what the eff is wrong with you? me - ""Well it's quite simple, you were told not to use my driveway if you were going drive on my lawn and wake me up every morning. Now get off my doorstep"" Him - ""I'll sue you if i lose my job because of you"" me - ""You've been warned. Don't trespass on my driveway or property again! "" Dude storms off in a huff spouting obscenities etc. So this happened on a Thursday, the kids have a PD day the next day and it's supposed to be one of those delightful Canadian weekends where it drops to like -40 Celsius.For my american friends, -40 is where Celsius and Fahrenheit meet up so it's freaking cold lol. So that night, i grabbed one of my more beat up plastic garbage bins, made sure to plug all the holes with a generous amount of duct tape, stuck a sign on it that read ""private property, driveway not for public use"" and proceeded to fill it to the brim with water. Now, before anyone thinks i'm a jerk willing to potentially endanger the other kids in the car, i'd like to point out that my neighbor's kid is the first to be picked up so it's just him in the car. Queue Monday morning. He sees the garbage can, backs up a bit more and defiantly charges the garbage can as if to teach me a lesson and proceeds to cause some pretty serious damage to the front end of his car. Dude gets out fuming, calls the cops and comes pounding on my door screaming about how i'm going to buy him a new car and that i'm about to be arrested. Cop - ""so let me make sure i understand this situation. He asked you not to park here if you couldn't refrain from honking, then warned you not to park here and put up a barrier. Now you expect him to be charged and pay for damages you caused yourself to your vehicle in an attempt to destroy his own personal property?"" I will never forget the look on his face when The officer said ""yeah that's not how this works"" and turned to me and asking if i wanted to pursue charges for him damaging my personal property. I just gave him the most shit eating grin i could muster and said ""nah i think we're good"". I then went back inside to enjoy a morning coffee while watching him from my kitchen window as he paced back and forth in the cold waiting for a tow truck and having to call the company he worked for to explain why they needed to send out another driver to complete his route."
"  person recounts getting arrested in Singapore, receiving a 2-year prison term and 12 painful strokes of the cane.","What Don’t People Know Happens When You Get Arrested?

I was born in Singapore, spent most of my childhood abroad, and only moved back at 17. Maybe if I grew up there I would have known more seriously how they treat crime and misbehaviour.
I didn't pay much attention in school and got involved in crime in my late teens and earlier 20s, eventually escalating to robbery. I didn't use a real weapon but pretended I had one, and it worked well for a while in a place where most people are unaccustomed to street crime, until inevitably I eventually got caught.
This was during the early pandemic so they maybe factored that in when giving me a comparably short prison term at only 2 year, but I think the judge made up for it by ordering 12 strokes of the cane, a bit higher than I expected. I knew it would hurt but I had no idea how bad it actually would be.
Prison was no fun, of course, but the worst was that they don't tell you what day your caning will be. So every day I wondered if today would be the day. I started to get very anxious after hearing a couple other prisoners say how serious it is.
They left me in that suspense for the first 14 months of my sentence or so until I began to try to hope, after hundreds of ""false alarms"" of guards walking by the cell for some other purpose, that maybe they'd forget or something and it would never happen. But nope, finally I was told that today's the day. I had to submit for a medical exam and a doctor certified that I was fit to receive my punishment.
My heart was racing all morning, and finally I was led away to be caned. It's done in private, outside the sight of any other prisoners. It's not supposed to be a public humiliation event like in Sharia, the punishment rather comes from the pain.
I had to remove my clothes and was strapped down to the device to hold me in place for the caning. There was a doctor there and some officers worked to set up some protection over my back so that only my buttocks was exposed. I had to thank the caning officers for carrying out my sentence to teach me a lesson.
I tried to psyche myself up thinking ""OK it's 12 strokes, I can do this!"" But finally the first stroke came. I remember the noise of it was so loud and then the pain was so shocking and intense, I cried out in shock and agony. I tried then to get away but I couldn't move.
By the 3rd stroke I could barely think straight, I remember feeling like my brain was on fire and the pain was all over my body, not just on the buttocks. I think I was crying but things become blurry after that in my memory. I remember the doctor checking to see if i was still fit for caning at one point and giving the go ahead to continue.
After the 12th stroke they released me but I couldn't move, 2 officers had to help me hobble off. They doused the wounds with antiseptic spray and then took me back to a cell to recover. My brain felt like it was melting from the pain so my sense of time is probably a bit distorted from that day but I remember I collapsed down in the cell and either passed our or went to sleep.
But little did I realize that the real punishment of Caning is more the aftermath, than the caning itself!
When I woke up the pain was still incredibly intense, but not so much that it was distorting my mind, which almost made it worse in a way. My buttocks had swollen immensely and any pressure on it felt like fire that immediately crippled me, almost worse than a kick to the groin.
My first time I felt like I had to use the toilet, I was filled with dread because of the pain...I managed to do it squatting instead of sitting, but still, just the motion of going ""#2"" agitated all the wounds and the pain was so sudden and intense that I threw up. I tried to avoid eating for a week because I didn't want to have to use the toilet.
After a couple days the officers told me I couldn't lay naked in my cell anymore and had to wear clothes. This was scary because they would agitate the wounds. I spent most of the day trying to lay face-down and totally still because even small movements would hurt so bad as the clothes rustled against it.
This continued for about a month before things started to heal, and even then, these actions remained very painful, just not cripplingly painful. I didn't sit or lay on my back for many months. By the time I got out of prison I had mostly recovered but even to this day, there are severe scars and the area can be a bit sensitive.
It was way worse than I expected the experience to be. I know it's my fault but I do wish my parents had warned me more about the seriousness of justice here when we moved back - though I know i wouldn't have listened as a stupid teen. Thankfully they were supportive when I got out and I'm getting back on my feet - literally and metaphorically."
"  woman throws away boyfriend's extensive yogurt collection due to space and smell issues, sparking an argument about boundaries and legality.","AITA for Throwing Away my Boyfriend's Potentially Illegal Yogurt Collection?

I'm a 29F, my boyfriend is a 30M. We've been living together for two years in a little studio in a very expensive, big US city.
My boyfriend grew up rurally, with lots of space, enough to collect all kinds of things. He collected action figures and video games and all the normal kids' stuff when he was young, but as he grew older, he became interested in more unusual things. As a teen, he had eight guinea pigs, of different types from different breeders. Since Tide Pods were released seven years ago, he's saved one of every kind of Tide Pod. He's got a big box of an international variety of electric insulators, those little ceramic hats that power lines wrap around on power poles.
He's not a hoarder. He's usually neat, just used to having lots of space for his bizarro collections. At his parents' ranch, he has two big rooms full of containers of weird (and impressive!) things.
He recently became interested in Yogurt. He's always hated dairy products, until about a year ago. He not just started drinking milk and sharing ice cream with me, but he's found a love for yogurts. So he now collects them, of course. The problem is that they're perishable.
So, until earlier today, our little 550 sq foot studio contained about 2100 cups of yogurt. It comes in tons of varieties. Different types, flavors, textures, containers, made by different companies in different countries. This is like crack to my boyfriend. So he tried to pretty much save a sample of everything he could find.
He filled our fridge, bought a new fridge, and then another tiny bedside fridge (he said he didn't want to walk to the fridge at night, but it was obviously a ruse to get more yogurt space). These fridges all filled up with his yogurts, and if you keep them for long, they smell bad. Sometimes the packaging breaks. So our apartment was smelling like rotten milk for the last two weeks -- and my boyfriend's attitude was ""oh it's fine"" and ""just deal with it for a little longer"" until I pulled the plug and threw it all out this morning. I was looking at my groceries, which I had to put beside the fridge because there was no space, and everything smelled like death, and then I kinda snapped and threw it all away.
My boyfriend is understandably upset. We've been arguing about whether I crossed a line by throwing away his stuff. And he's especially upset because he (of course) had rare yogurts that were hard to find -- in particular, he had some Cuban and Iranian yogurts that you can't get in the US. But I know that we have trade sanctions against Iran and Cuba, so I don't know if it was even legal for him to have them? I asked where he got his Iranian yogurt, but he kept insisting ""the Iranian Yogurt is not the issue here"" and that the real issue was me throwing out his precious yogurts without his permission."
"  woman refuses to acknowledge her parents' attempts to reconnect after years of abandonment, sparking mixed reactions from family members.","AITA for pretending not to recognize my parents when they tried to reconnect?

I was raised mostly by my uncle and aunt. My older sister developed a serious illness when I was 6 and my parents decided that they couldn’t care for both of us I guess, so they kind of unceremoniously dumped me at my grandparents and my uncle took me in. Like, didn’t even explain to me what was going on, just “you’re going to go visit gran for awhile” and never picked me back up. My grandparents and uncle explained it later, and they were pretty livid at my parents. I’ve seen my parents maybe 5 times since then and not at all for the last 9 years. I decided to stop having contact with them when I was 12 and since I was the only one reaching out all communication broke down. It turned out ok, I love my aunt and uncle and it turns out they can’t have kids so they’ve always said I’m their miracle kid, I was just misrouted by the stork at first. I was formally adopted by them when I turned 18, I wish it had been earlier but there were some red tape things that would have made that really expensive and difficult. I’m 21 now.
My sister passed away between thanksgiving and Christmas and I made a trip back from school for the funeral, but I stayed in the back and left before my bio parents could talk to me. They called my uncle to try to talk to me, but I said I didn’t want to so he told them that I wasn’t available at the moment.
They finally caught up to me over Christmas when I went to midnight mass with my gran, and approached me and tried to give me a hug. I did recognize them, but I pretended not to and just backed off and said “Sorry, do I know you?” They said “We’re your parents!” and I said “My parents are at home.” and went and sat down with my gran. They sat behind us and I could just feel the stare, and on the way out they were like “You really don’t recognize us?” And I said “Oh, are you my dad’s brother? I think I remember you from when I was little.”
My gran thinks they deserved it trying to come back to me like nothing happened, but they wrote me a long letter about how hurt they are and how I should understand that they were trying to do the right thing and how they’ll always be my parents and I can’t change that. Other family members think I was too harsh as they’re grieving, but I don’t think they should get a pass just because they remembered me now that my sister is gone."
"  man discovers he is biologically related to his wife after getting tested to donate a kidney, raising complex emotional dilemmas.","TIFU By getting tested to donate a kidney to my wife.

I decided to get tested to see if I could donate my kidney to my wife of 6 years. We have two kids together (4f,2m). My wife got sick just after our son was born and now is in need of a kidney transplant. We checked with her relatives and none were a match or a viable doner.
Last week I got tested. I knew it would be a long shot so I decided to get tested to see if I could donate. I got a call the other day saying that I was a match. The doctor then said something about wanting to do additional testing due to some information from the HLA tissue test results. I didn't think much of it and agreed.
Then the results came in I was shocked and confused. He explained that because of how DNA information is passed down through generations a parent to a child could have at least a 50% match. Siblings could have a 0-100% match. It was rare to have a high match as husband and wife. I asked what does that mean.
He said that my wife and I have an ""abnormally high match percentage.""
Long story short were related. No I'm not kidding. I was put up for adoption before I was born. Placed into a family that moved across the country. I knew I was adopted but we didn't have any I formation about my bio family. It was a closed adoption.
I met my wife by chance 8 years ago. I was on a trip from work and she was working at the sight I went to. We worked together for a week. We exchanged numbers kept in touch. I was sent back there 3 more times that year and each time we became closer. I was given the opertunity to be transferred out there in a new higher paying position in a different department as hers the rest is history.
I don't know what do do moving forward but I know it may be wrong. She is my wife and the mother of our kids. This post is probably going to get removed but it is all true.


Since we love redditbedtimestory viewers, here’s the update.
The reason her family couldn't donate was that close relatives had some medical issues that prevent them from donating. Examples: high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, heavy drinkers, and more. The further out we tested the less percent of a match. I wanted to be tested because we needed to find someone. The doctor said it would be unlikely but wouldn't hurt to try.
I was freaking out after I got the news and had to get outside advice. When the doc said that the percentage was abnormally high and that we might be related I kind of zoned out and started to piece things together in my mind.
My parents live a thousand miles away. They met my inlaws a few times. Once at my wedding and when both my children were born.
My children are fine. My daughter is incredibly smart for her age. My son is a handful and healthy.
The way my adoption worked was when my bio mom gave birth to me I was checked out and put in a different room(I was there but don't know how it officially worked). From what My parents explained they were in that room waiting. They never met my bio mom in person. My bio mom only had a profile and picked them out of many candidates.
I called my parents and told them that I needed to know everything they knew about my bio mom. They told me that they had limited knowledge. They said she was a single mom that was 16 years old. The father was not in the picture. Also, I was born in a hospital one hour from where my wife was born. Like I said limited knowledge.
Growing up I didn't want to find out about my bio parents. To me, my parents were always my parents. I knew I was adopted and that it was a closed adoption. I figure it wouldn't matter long term.
I'm not going to do an additional at-home DNA test through any of the traditional testing sights like 23 or ancestry due to personal reasons. Like the possibility of the family finding out. The doc said all of this to only me, not with my wife present. Some of the additional tests were done through the doctor which was the cM test? (I'm not an expert on DNA testing) they said it was like a 1900+ cM match. This basically confirms one of my bio parents is one of hers. (it can also mean first cousins or aunt/uncle) I'm guessing her dad. (when my kids were born my parents brought photos of me as a baby and commented that I and my son looked a lot like my wife's dad). My son was easily explainable. But all 3 of us are a different story.
I'm not going to bring this up ever. I might look at my FIL differently but nothing will hopefully change. I hope none of the family goes on Reddit and connects the dots.
I am donating my kidney to my wife. We have started the full process. That takes time and a lot of preparation. I plan on talking to my wife after the surgery and after recovery. We will decide what to do with our kids. If we are going to get them tested or ever tell them. I will not be leaving my wife. I love and will always be there for her. I made vows and I will keep them. I love her more than I would a half-sister."
"  friends suspect their girlfriends are the same person due to uncanny similarities and shared experiences, leading to confusion and doubt.","Me (20M) and my friend (23M) think our girlfriends (both 19F) might be the same person

A little context before we start, I'm (20M), my friend (23M) is Kevin, my girlfriend (19F) is Paige, his is (19F) Maya [fake names for privacy]. All of this takes place in an online discord server where we all became friends with each other. Kevin introduced me to the server, I introduced Maya, and Maya introduced Paige. Kevin and M started dating a few months before I started talking to Paige, and a few months later me and Paige started dating. Paige and Maya look similar, have a similar household, and share a lot more similarities than that. A month or two ago, Paige and Maya both got their phone taken away at the same time for the same duration. Me and Kevin had a chat about it since we were both pretty much in the same boat, and we realized they had a lot more in common than we thought, but we both laughed it off. Recently, in the last 6 weeks or so, Kevin's girlfriend Maya stopped talking to him as much, so him and another mutual friend started digging into some of Maya's personal information. Kevin and the other friend both started to think that Paige and Maya could be the same person, and to confirm it last night they asked me for some pictures of Paige.
Asides from them looking very similar, there were a large amount of similarities, from the paint on the wall, placement of the door, a step ladder near the doorway, and a painting over the bed. Another set of pictures in the bathroom had the same sink material and design, hooks over the door, towel rack across from the sink, and the same phone case. I sent Kevin a voice recording of Paige and he says she sounds exactly the same, we've also both noticed that Paige and Maya both have some similar habits in voice calls, like open mic, screaming what to their parents, clearing throat in the middle of singing, etc. One of the strangest aspects is that Maya had a profile picture of some girl from instagram, not very popular but a good 1.5k followers. Maya claims to not have instagram or facebook, but the interesting thing is that Paige follows the account Maya got the avatar from. Upon asking the instagram user, she said she has never heard of discord before and it couldn't possibly be her. Kevin and I go to confront Paige about it, but she vehemently denies it but says that she and Maya used to have a small thing between them so Maya has some pictures of Paige that were sent to Kevin.
Kevin's perspective is extremely convincing and there is a mountain of evidence against Paige/Maya, but I've received a lot more pictures of Paige than Kevin has of Maya. Paige has been extremely apologetic (poor word), trying to convince us that she's just as confused as we are and she's scared of what's happening. I don't know how to process all of this information, I'm not sure who I want to believe, I'm not sure who I should believe. The two conclusions I was able to draw up were that either Paige/Maya are the same person, or that Maya is a catfish and was cat-fishing Paige at one point and then began to catfish Kevin afterwards."
"  roommates clash over appearance. Person believes effort matters in attractiveness, while roommate feels person is too focused on looks. Tension ensues.","AITA for telling my roommate it's his fault he isn't attractive?

Six months ago I (23) moved in with Alex (24), a friend I met in my last year of college.
I'm well-groomed and considered good looking so I get attention from women when we go out. This is normally met by comments from Alex about how lucky I am to look like I do. But it isn't luck. I used to be skinny and pimply like him before I started transforming my appearance in my first year of college. I started lifting weights 5-6 times a week. Eating healthy. Drinking water. Learning fashion. Figuring out what hair/beard style looks good on me. Figuring out a skincare routine that works for me. I'm proud of my appearance because of how much effort I've put in and I don't appreciate comments about how lucky I am.
Alex has potential. Tall, good facial structure, good career. But he puts in no effort. He eats unhealthy - mainly soda, preprocessed food, and Doordash. His style is hoodies, t-shirts, and jeans/sweatpants. No skincare. Doesn't work out. Dry hair from using 3 in 1 shampoo. Sedentary lifestyle from spending a lot of time gaming. He's also a bit abrasive while I try to be friendly. I try to help him without sounding judgmental - I'll invite him to cook, go shopping, or go to the gym with me. Productive, self-improving activities. But always rejects it.
Last week I invited him to drink with our neighbors and their friends. A few of the new people were complimenting my fashion and we talking about our favorite stores. Alex butts in and says ""you just need to be born lucky like OP and you'll look good in everything."" Alex somehow steers the conversation towards my dating life and makes more salty comments about how I get girls and he gets none.
Alex's oversharing on my behalf and his comments pissed me off. Especially stuff about being born lucky, because if anything HE'S the one who was born lucky. He was raised in a white upper middle class household and both of his parents are tenured professors at the prestigious university we went to. I was raised in a family of poor immigrants and had to grind for scholarships to have any hope of affording the same school. In college, I had to hustle for good-paying internships and TA jobs to afford clothes and products for my ""glow-up."" Even though I make more, he has more money to spend on improving himself because I send half of my paycheck to my family.
When Alex and I get back to our apartment, he makes another luck comment and I snap a little a bit. I told him he could look better if he tried, he asks what I mean, I go over the differences in our habits I mentioned above, he gets angry and starts saying stuff like ""society is worse when attractive people get full of themselves instead of realizing how lucky they are."" I finally fully snap and tell him he puts in no effort and it's his own fault he doesn't look good. He then went back to his room and slammed his door. It's been over a week and we've barely spoken since. AITA? Was I too harsh?"
"  guy (20) and their brothers refuse to care for their dad's stepchildren, citing negative impact and lack of connection. AITA?","AITA for refusing to agree to help with the care of my dad's stepchildren in the event of his and his wife's death?

Hear me out. I am the youngest of three brothers. There's me (20), older brother (22) and oldest brother (23). We lost our mom when we were small kids and our dad didn't want to be a single dad forever, so he got married again to Janet. Janet had two of her own disabled children and her first husband had also died. When dad got married my brothers and I told him we weren't ready and we felt it was too fast. He told us it was his decision, he was doing the best thing for all of us, and the benefits would outweigh any feelings of ""too fast"". But due to marrying someone with two disabled children we of course didn't get this extra amazing life he was trying to paint for us.
What we got was needing to adjust our needs for theirs, missing out on stuff we wanted to do because those two kids needed full time care, having much less money and also less time with the one parent we did have. He was either working longer hours OR he was taking care of his stepkids so his wife could have a break. We also got less time with extended family because my dad said it wouldn't be nice to show off all the people we had vs his stepkids had, and we should be together ""as a family"" as much as possible.
Now that we're all adults they realize they need to figure out something for when the two of them are dead. Janet has no family support, her first husbands family isn't involved and our dad's family are not super close to her kids. She and dad expected me and my brothers to step up, be siblings, be family, for her kids and agree to make sure they are okay when neither she or my dad are alive. None of us want to do it. None of us even stay in touch with our dad today. We're out of the house and we make no effort because we lost him when he remarried. He remarried because he wanted a wife, not for our greater good. That much is clear.
They asked us and we said no. The tactic now is to divide and try and get one of us to break. Dad has been reaching out and trying to say he knows I'm a good guy and must care about their wellbeing in some way. The guilt trip is getting to me a little. Especially when he talks about how messed up it is to leave vulnerable people with anyone. Not because I do care but I know his stepkids are innocent and have nobody else. But I don't feel the urge to do it even with that. Am I the A hole?"
"  best friends, 23M and 22F, accidentally got pregnant while drunk. Keeping the baby, moving in together, and exploring their romantic feelings.","TIFU by getting my Bestfriend pregnant

Probably my biggest f up ever, which will haunt me for the next 18 years. Just feels so surreal, not necessarily panicking tho. I'm 23M and my female friend, whom I've known for the most part of my life, is currently 22. I still remember us playing every day as little kids to hanging out almost everyday as teenagers, we often went on vacation together either with my or her parents. She was sort of like the sister I never had, and people now hearing that I got her pregnant feels almost like it's illegal.
A few months ago, I was at her apartment and both of us were super drunk, and yeah it somehow just happened. It was good, so I guess in the following weeks it accidentally happened quite often🤷🏽‍♂️. We did use condoms , but she isn't on birth control. How the hell did she get pregnant. I know that there are a few, who even get pregnant on birth control, but never thought it would happen to us. She took 5 pregnancy tests and 1 week later went to the gynecologist, who confirmed. We both can't bring it on ourselves to abort the baby, so we're keeping it, we're financially stable so I don't think it would be a problem.
We're planning on telling our parents this evening, so awkward since they've seen me grow up with her etc. The only one who's been shipping us since day one, was her grandma lol . Still can't believe I'll have to spend 18 years of my life ,well it's not even 18 years it's a life commitment lol.
Ok guys, I just went with her to her parents house, we actually wanted to go in the evening as I said, but the sooner the better I guess. I was really nervous ,her dad was working in the garden and her mom was cleaning around the house. After thirty minutes, everyone was gathered in the kitchen, so we thought a better opportunity wouldn't come. We told them and I could see the horror in their eyes. lol
I don't know if they seemed kinda happy, but also shocked. Her mom started tearing up, so I guess she's either happy or disappointed. Her dad asked why we didn't tell them that we're dating"" and my god that was such an awkward moment because both of us didn't reply, (awkward silence).
They were asking a bunch of questions, and we even called her grandma telling her that her prediction was right. We made up an excuse and left, later on in the car she gave me a kiss and told me that she was proud of me, the whole drive her hand was resting on my thigh. Like does that mean she likes me?? I don't want to misinterpret anything to make things even worse. She's a very very kind person in general, so a bunch of guys always thought she liked them while she was only being nice.
Okay Guys that'll be my final update, maybe if I remember I'll update in 9 months let's see.
I discussed everything with her that needed to be discussed. We're planning on moving together when she's 6-7 months pregnant, and we'll just see how it works. We both admitted to having feelings for eachother, so we'll just see where it goes, and leave our relationship as it is best friends, who live together and bang I guess.
To clarify, apparently a few didn't get it,yes we are dating
Bestfriend+ banging = Dating
Reddit Bedtime Story viewers, since we love you here’s the update,
I can‘t lie but those months were definitely more stressful and complicated than I expected them to be, considering Us being so young , nonetheless it was all worth it the first time I held my little baby girl in my arms.
We didn‘t know the gender of our baby, since we wanted it to be a surprise. When it comes to gender I don‘t necessarily have a preference, but I‘d be lying if I said I never wanted to be a girl dad And for anyone wondering if she‘s my child , Yes she is haha, she even inherited a family illness of mine (not saying that‘s good)
So I think the question most of you want answered is, what happened between me and my best friend ?
Well we did move in together , which was definitely a financial burden for us, and money in some months is really tight, since we pay everything out of our own pocket. (I don‘t really like the idea of using our parents money, even if this would help us a lot)
I found it sort of funny how people were actually believing that I was this oblivious, which I actually wasn‘t haha. Well maybe a bit, realizing she has been dropping hints, since we were like 16 .
I feel like I mainly highlighted the negative consequences , but it‘s honestly pretty awesome too. The best feeling is to find a Best Friend in a Lover, and I couldn‘t imagine loving anyone as much as I love her."
"  hospitalized with COVID during finals, student writes essay by hand in ICU. Professor fails to understand circumstances and fails student.","Professor made me write my entire final project in ICU

I know, I know, the title sounds intense but there is no way I can make it less like a clickbait, cause it is what it is.
So back in early December I started to feel sick. Not sick sick, but I have not been able to eat a lot and lost around 8 kg of weight in 10 days. (I will admit that I am fat and was kinda happy that I just magically dropped weight) I was blaming it on “too little rest”, “I just didn’t get use to the food here in the US (I’m came here from another country for college)”, or “I might have digestive problems, might need to check them out”. It was on the 13th that everything just suddenly went downhills. I woke up exhausted, sweating, and not being able to eat anything other than drinking bottles and bottles of water. It lasted for the entire day until 10pm. I started to feel like I’m about to pass out, so I went to an ER nearby with my roommate.
Well, in short I had COVID, as well as a certain life threatening thing going on. (I’m not going to name it but some of you might be able to tell from above.) I had immediately a bunch of IVs put in and was moved to one of the ICUs.
I lost consciousness as soon as I arrived in the ICU and didn’t wake up until the next morning, and for the next 48 hours or so I have been slipping in and out of consciousness. My doctor wanted me to sit in a chair instead of laying down all day so pretty much all day I was just passed out in a chair. I can vaguely remember dropping my phone on the floor and I didn’t even have the energy to pick it up.
Now all that was the buildup. On the third day when I finally felt better, I went on my school portal and saw a new message from one of my professors, telling me that I’m late for turning in my essay for the final project. (Cause it was finals week, duh) I know I had the essay 80% completed and it was in my laptop, which was packed and sent to a friend's place by my roommate, because we were moving out of our dorm room at the time. And that friend happened to be out of town in NY celebrating the new year. AND even if my roommate got the laptop somehow from the friend's place, they wouldn’t have been able to hand it to me because I had Covid and they didn’t allow me to visit. So ya, everything was screwed. I explained the entire situation to the Professor in a long, fully written out message, and they never responded.
Fast forward a few days, the Professor contacted me again, this time via email, to ask about my assignment. Their entire message was like “(my name), where is your project?”
I was triggered. I was mad. Well to be honest, I wasn’t in my best mental state because of what happened in the past few days. So I pasted my entire message that I sent to her in my email responding to that, just in case she hadn’t read it in the school portal website.
She went something like “well too bad I’m going to have to fail you on this project, cause it has been assigned two weeks ago and you should’ve done it then”
ma’am, I could have totally finished it before the deadline IF I WASN'T IN ICU AND IN A COMA FOR TWO DAYS WITHOUT MY LAPTOP.
The doctors ended up deciding to keep me for a few more days after I’m no longer in danger, and hell did I make good use of that.
I asked for a bunch of paper that of course, had the hospital’s name printed on them. I wrote my entire essay again, BY HAND, on them. When you write the same piece of text the second time, trust me, it becomes way easier than the first time. I made sure to write as neatly as I can, trying my best to guilt them in every way possible. Then as I promised in my response, I took a picture of it (making sure that I accidentally included my hand that is swollen with the IV plugged in and a bit of my hospital robe (they call it a johnny?)) and sent it away.
I sent the assignment to them on December the 17th. Not until yesterday, way after the semester had ended, that they called and kinda sorta apologized (“I was too busy to check my messages because finals are coming up so I barely looked at your explanation, blah blah blah”). I’ve no idea where they got my number, but fine. I’ll take it.
As of now, I have decided to take a gap year and go back to my home country for a bit. My health has been greatly affected by what happened and going back home to take some rest might be good for me. I also get to spend some time with my mom who has been very anxious since the first day I had the medical incident."
"  person's sister threw away their food for being ""unhealthy."" Person asked her to leave, causing family conflict. Feeling conflicted.","AITA for making my sister homeless overnight because she threw my food away?

My sister and I grew up together but aren't very close. It really wasn't from any drama (we didn't have a big fight to cause distance), but rather just have opposite personalities and interests. If I had to describe my attitude towards my sister it would be ""apathetic love"". Like, she's my sister so I want her to be healthy and happy, but we just unfortunately don't hang out, call to chat, etc.
She recently received an opportunity to interview for a job near our hometown, and reached out to see if she could stay with me for a week. My mother was ecstatic that my sister might be ""coming home finally"". She moved across the county right after college and hasn't been back in almost 10 years except for Christmas (she spends Thanksgiving with her in-laws) or the one off birthday/business trip/vacation.
I was more than happy to open my home up, thinking that we could maybe bond or deepen our relationship. It was all kind of awkward but nothing horrible until the third night. I came home from drinks with my friends around 10PM, went into my kitchen for a snack, and realized that almost ALL of my food was gone.
I'm not even exaggerating. I swear 90% of my pantry was just gone. I asked my sister and she told me that she was shocked I ate anything with preservatives and ""unnatural"" and that I was ""poisoning my body"" so she took it upon herself to throw away EVERYTHING she deemed unhealthy.
Guys, I'm talking about SO much food both packaged and unpackaged. Even things like spices that weren't fresh were tossed! It was like someone had robbed my kitchen. I demanded that she pay to replace everything, but she dug her heels in and said that she was doing me a favor and that the way I ate was ""disgusting"" (her literal words). I know I'm biased, but my diet isn't even crazy. It's pretty much standard food you'd find at any grocery store.
I was so upset I made her pack up and leave, and she ended up having to take a cab about 30 minutes away to stay with my parents. My mom is absolutely devastated that we're fighting and insists that I apologize in order to keep the peace, because she really hopes my sister will take the job and move back.
I told my mom that if she wanted to lose not one, but both daughters then she'd keep pushing me to apologize for something I feel I have a right to be upset about. My dad says that she's been crying every night though, and I love my mom so much I feel like a huge AH for being stubborn about the situation."
"  hooking up with a psychic turned awkward when she mentioned person's deceased grandma during intimate moments, ruining the experience.","TIFU by hooking up with a psychic

Last night I (28m) managed to convince an attractive girl (25) to come home with me. It was the end result of a successful first date. Well, successful-ish. As soon as the two of us were naked in bed, she froze and asked if I lost a loved one recently. That question caught me off guard because my face was buried between her legs at the time. I didn't answer at first, but she asked again. The second time she literally made me stop eating her out so I could respond. For the record, she did mention that she had a sixth sense when we were getting to know each other, but we never discussed it in detail.
To answer her question, I said my grandma passed away not so long ago. My date nodded her head and said she sensed my grandma's presence. I said I didn't believe in ghosts and continued eating her out. My date said my grandma had a message for me. At that moment, I was doing everything I could in the pussy eating department to distract my date from talking about my dead grandmother, but sadly, my mouth intimate game did nothing to prevent her from telling me that grandma wanted me to forgive my brother. I stopped what I was doing and asked my date what she meant. A few years ago, my brother hooked up with my gf (now ex). I hated him afterwards and our relationship basically became nonexistent. I never shared that information with anyone, let alone with a girl I just met, but somehow she knew.
When I asked my date how she knew that, she said my grandma. She knew my grandma's name, which was another detail I never shared. As my scepticism began to fade, I asked my date if my grandma could actually see what we were doing. She said yes. My penis automatically disabled its erection function and shrunk in shame. My meat has been soft ever since. Intimacy was no longer possible for me when I imagined ghost granny not only watching me during s x, but also feeding my partner sensitive information about me from beyond the grave. I didn't sleep at all. My first proper date of the year and I get f ing haunted during s x."
"  teen's resentment towards cheating mom surfaces as he gifts her a book on infidelity, causing emotional distress and self-doubt.","I gave my cheating mom the Worst Gift Ever, Did she deserve it?

I'm (16 M) and I love my mom (35) but when I was 10 she had an affair and left us, I visited her as often as I could and she always seemed so happy when I was there but I hated her new family so I stopped visiting. Honestly we rarely ever saw each other after just for my birthday and events really. She wants us to be close but I want nothing to do with her new husband so I've kept my distance.
Except on Feb 20th my dad announced he'd be out on business till the 12th and my grandparents are stuck visiting relatives in Italy and so I really had nowhere to go and my mom jumped at the chance to have me stay with her. And just my luck that my mom's anniversary with her husband was on Sunday.
I haven't had a good time here at all so all I do is stay in my room doing homework or go out with friends to avoid family activities cause it sucks seeing how lovey dovey she is with her husband and how they seem like the perfect family with their daughters. The morning before her anniversary day she came to my bed and tried to cuddle with me like before she left us but it made me angry like we can't go back in time and pretend it's how it was. So I just pretended to be asleep and stayed curled up and frozen till she left. I started crying cause of that and I felt angry and snarky and my mom majored in literature so I got her a copy of Anna Karenina for her anniversary. That book's about a lady who leaves her husband and son for her lover. I've never read it but I watched the movie with my girlfriend and I hated it.
The anniversary party was on Sunday. Everyone was having fun but me and then people gave their gifts. I gave mine and when my mom saw what it was she seemed shocked but just said thanks. The party ended like an hour after. But at night when she was in her room I heard her crying really loudly. So I kinda eavesdropped a little and heard her saying stuff about that book and me and her husband trying to calm her. The next day at breakfast she left for work early before I woke up and her husband straight up called me an asshole and other stuff for gifting them that. It's been a few days now and my mom has barely talked to me. Honestly I feel so wrong I made my mom cry but at the same time I don't want to be here and she knows that so am I really the asshole?"
"  husband requested threesome with narrator's best friend, causing distress and potential end to marriage. Narrator is pregnant and devastated.","My husband of 5 years asked for a three way with my best friend and she agreed. 

I met my husband 7 years ago and we have been married for 5 of those years. I love my husband and all that he has done for me but I fear that my marriage and my relationship with my best friend is now over. not to mention i just found i'm pregnant and this only started happening after i told my husband (he was very much on board with having a child with me and we have been trying for around 6 months).
For context, my best friend let’s call her Mia, knew my husband before me and they were incredibly close before I even knew him. When I first met my husband I suspected there was something going on between them but they always denied it. however they admitted while they were drunk that they were indeed sleeping together before i got with my husband. even though it’s not important now it still plays on my mind, you know? especially considering what just happened.
anyways. Two weeks ago my husband suggested a threesome for the first time and I was already not on board with it. I quickly said no and hoped he’d never bring it up again. Two days after that he suggested it again, and I once again declined. He asked again that night after we had intercourse and once again, I said no.
After that, he stopped asking and I thought that was the end of it. However, three days ago he asked me out to lunch and I was pretty excited considering he never takes me on dates anymore. When we got to the restaurant my best friend was sitting there and was confused because he never mentioned that she’d be there. The vibe was weird from the start tbh but I tried to think nothing of it. halfway through the lunch my husband asked me again “I want to consider the idea of a threesome again and I thought it would be a good idea if Mia was involved.” I didn't know what to say. I asked if Mia knew about this and she said yes and that she’d known about his plans for over a month. I was devastated. I said no, paid for my meal and left with my car. Mia was my closest friend for ages. I have a few old friends from highschool but after I met him our relationship moves pretty fast and we moved in together not long after dating so I was busy with taking care of our home. My father isn’t here anymore and my grandma is in a nursing home. My sister recently gave birth so the only person I really can stay with is my mother. They both agreed to arrange a talk with me this morning and I'm not even that shocked but I still can't stop crying. When I arrived they were sitting so close to each other it genuinely made me feel so sick. they didn’t seem upset at all, they were just talking like normal and even smiling which is so gross to me seeing as they both know how upset i am right now. Anyways, when I sat down I flat out asked them if they had been seeing each other behind my back and everything I've been suspecting these past three days was confirmed. They had been sleeping with each other. I am so heartbroken right now. I don't think I can carry this child. These past few days have felt so unreal and I'm a wreck. I know that it’s early to decide this but I do think abortion is the correct decision for me.
i also asked him why he decided to tell me now and not earlier or when i wasn’t carrying his child and he literally just shrugged and shook his head and then said “i don’t know.” as if that was a good enough answer. Mia was mostly quiet the whole time but I don't think she feels the slightest bit of guilt.
to everyone saying divorce, that is most likely what will happen. I'm terrified as I've known him for most of my adult life and he is the only man I've ever been with. He is in control of our bills, our rent and overall finances. I literally have no idea what I'm doing."
"  chance encounter with wheelchair girl at bar led to friendship, meeting her friend, marriage, and having a daughter. Life-changing small decision.","What's the craziest butterfly effect that happened to you because of a small decision you made?

Decided to approach a girl in a wheelchair in a bar because I thought it was cool of her to be out and about having a good time. We become bar buddies. A week later she brings a friend with her. I get along with the friend. We start dating, we marry, we have a daughter. Had I not said 'hi' to the wheelchair lady that night, I wouldn't have the most precious things in my life right now.
. Like I said before, after approaching the girl ( let's call her Y) on the wheelchair we hung out the rest of the night and exchanged contact numbers. I did not intend to pursue her in any romantic fashion even though she was actually very attractive. Her disability was temporary. She told mr she passed out in the bathtub and hit her head and when she woke up she couldn't feel her legs. Shr was doing physiotherapy. As far as I know, I believe she started walking a couple years after meeting her.
So, we were buddies for a while, I would push her chair all over town and made sure she was accepted in my group of friends. Even though my friends made jokes about me liking her, I never put myself out there as someone who was interested and she always shut those jokes off and kind of belittled me as if I was not good enough for her. Which was fine, I took it as banter between friends. The night I met my wife, I took Y home because well, she was in a wheelchair and it was like 3 am. We sat outside her house and talked until like 7am. We talked about everything and she asked if I liked her friend (my wife), I said yes and she asked if I wanted her to give it a little push. I said I didn't need that and I prefer it for things to be natural and that I would approach her friend on my own terms and that was that.
Well...she didn't like that. Not that I didn't accept her help, but that I liked her friend. Apparently I had been leading her on for weeks by being nice and considerate of her disability. I didn't know it when I approached her first but she confessed later she didn't have a lot of friends, so I tried to be one. Even if I was romantically invested in her, which I obviously wasn't, she would often assure me I had no chance with her. Now thinking about it I guess she was ""negging"" me? Well, it worked pretty well. I had absolutely no interest in her in a romantic way. And after hanging out for weeks I actually stopped liking her because she would create drama every where we went. Shouting at waitresses, bullying bouncers in overcrowded bars to let her in because she was in a wheelchair, playing psychological games with my friends, the list goes on. After finding out I was interested in her friend, she cancelled dinner with me and my friends and went to the restaurant her friend worked and created a scene and told her not to see me ever again. Her friend told her to calm down and still wanted to meet up at the same bar we always went. They came and Y spent the whole night bad mouthing me to my friends, every time I was talking to anyone in the bar - specially girls - she would come over and start shouting and telling them I wasn't worth shit. I had no clue why she was acting that way and it turns out she liked me the whole time and told my friends I was a acting like a teenager leading her on - even though she constantly negged me and belittled me in front of everyone? Someone was a little bit delusional. I had to come clean with her friend and said I never showed interested in Y and that I actually liked her and wanted to take her out. Y proceeded to run her friend over with the wheelchair. Her friend is now my wife and everytime Y's name comes up she won't shut up about how her foot still hurts even years after that incident. Y spent the next weeks trying to turn my friends against me even though they had known me for decades and knew I wasn't this mean person she was trying to say I was.
I don't regret any of it. I was always fair and never tried or showed any interested besides friendship with her. When she asked me if I was into her friend I straight up told her yes. I'm happy to have met her, and that she introduced me to my wife, I hope she is well and healthy but we don't keep in touch, no.

Saw her at the 10-year High school reunion.
She was a bit heavier than she'd been in HS, but still attractive. She was there with her Ivy League fiancé. These two facts combined to change my mindset from ""I wanna bang my Highschool crush at our reunion"" to ""Oh well, nevermind.""
At one point, we were being recognized for something, and with all eyes on us, she leaned over and said, ""I remember what a crush you had on me. You wanted me baaad.""
First, I couldn't really react, given the immediate circumstances. Second, I didn't detect any kind of Taco Bell-type invitation in what she'd said (sorry). In fact, it almost seemed like she was just lording it over me. I mean, she was there with her fiancé, who, we'd determined in previous small-talk, she loooved and who was awesome!
For some reason, it really pissed me off. I just gave her a blank look, shrugged, and walked away. To this day, I wish I'd had some kind of witty comeback, but that's about my only regret. Haven't seen her since, but I hope she's happy,"

I asked for a test and she laughed at me which was enough proof for me. I filed for divorce and she delayed.

They even tried using the Post traumatic stress disorder talk that was in the news about military in general against me, as if my background meant I was ""touched"" and should just accept being trapped by someone I used to love. I was stressed but I am not an idiot. Not long after I just grabbed what I could as fast as I could and left. If I ever go back I'll face criminal charges because I am being held legally responsible for a life that can not possibly belong to me. There is still no test and at this point I would not be surprised if one had been produced and tampered to empower the lie. I am thinking it will catch up to me one day, but until then I am living relatively OK elsewhere. It is not right, what she did, and I refuse to kneel. I would sooner pass  or have my legs broken to force surrender than willingly support a woman who attempted to get me to raise a kid that was a result of her own crap. She may get me eventually, but by then it'll be too late. She is not getting the payout she planned on, instead she is raising a kid alone though I left her with a nice sob story obviously and if or when the sword finally comes down it'll just be so she can feel like she finally ""got"" me. She pointlessly ruined both our lives with this crap, I would've given her a kid on return, I just didn't want to impregnate her and then die and leave my unborn child fatherless and I am never going to forgive her for that."
"  a teenager sleeps with his best friend's grieving mother during the friend's coma recovery, leading to guilt and avoidance afterward.","What's the worst thing you have ever done?

What's the worst thing you have ever done? My best friend and his father were in a car accident 5 years ago  when we were both 16. His dad was declared dead at the scene and my best friend ended up in a coma for 12 weeks. I spent a lot of time at the hospital and his house and as a result, his mom. Us spending a lot of time together created some unwanted, as well as unmentioned tension between us. We could both feel it, but of course neither acted nor spoke of it. A couple of weeks after the accident she just broke down completely as she was driving me home from the hospital. She told me she couldn't be alone that night and begged me to stay with her for a couple of hours. I succumbed to her request and went back to hers. She was an avid grass user and she rolled up for us both. She said she was doing this because it helps her relax and lowers her heart rate which is something needed for her right now. We finish smoking and then she whips out a wine glass and pours us both a generous dose. We throw on a comedy show and it is hilarious. We are both laughing and start getting touchy, hand across thigh here hand on hip there. She then told me she wants to try something. She pops a few sour candies and tells me to close my eyes. As soon as I do I feel her going to town on me. It was the greatest thing I had ever felt, but also the most shameful. I was conscious of what I was doing the whole time, but it felt too good to stop. I lost my v card to her that night. While my friend’s life was hanging in the balance, his dad just buried, I was sleeping with his mom. I had always had a thing for her, I mean, she was my friend’s super attractive mom. This became a regular thing between me and her. This stopped immediately after he was released from hospital and we avoid each other now."

I made my boyfriend’s family disown him. I met him when I was 13. He was 18, he was popular, I was bullied. He liked that I was myself and didn’t care about what others thought of me. He love bombed me, he made me believe he was the only one I would ever need and made me misbehave against my parents. I was 13, too young to really understand what was going on, I just did what he told me to do. He told me to drink alcohol with him, since we’re European he could get me some. There wasn’t only alcohol in that drink. I sipped for a bit and passed out. I woke up unclothed. He told me I started my menstrual cycle and that he helped me, only to admit later what he really did. We did it more often, always started with protection but it would slip off or start hurting him. He also said he wanted an open relationship, I didn’t know what it was but told him I didn’t want it. At one point he told me he needed to watch gay corn to get hard and do me. He also told me about a crush he had on my male friend. One day, when I was 17 and numb, we were with his friends who joked about him sleeping with my friend. My friend? Sleeping with my male friend? That’s when I found out he had been cheating on me with men for over 3 years. He brushed this off, told his friends I already knew. I didn’t. 3 horrible tear filled weeks later I went to the doctor for a disease test. Tested positive and even worse, they found cancerous cells. I had to be treated for that, they found them in time but I still needed to undergo chemotherapy and other treatments, making me infertile. Now, I had a good bond with his Russian christian Orthodox parents, I was the dream christian raised girl. They loved me and I abused this, I abused the fact they were orthodox and told them he was gay and cheated. I never spoke to him again but one of his friends nearly attacked me on the streets because his dad allegedly hurt the ever living crap out of him, disowned him and sent him back to Russia to live with family. At first I felt guilty, I ruined his life. I ruined his life, his relationship with his family. But he took away my choice of who I’d lose my V card to, the capability to have my own children and a big part of my Early adulthood. I’m a bad person for abusing his romantic interests and his parents beliefs. He’s a bad person for abusing me. It took me years of therapy to get over this, I’ve went homeless and couldn’t afford therapy. Luckily I got back on my feet and am doing quite well. My current partner is very understanding of the situation. Since we can’t have children of our own, we’re currently saving up to adopt. "

What's the most horrific act committed by someone you know personally? A few years ago, I was on some dating site. I saw this lady who was too old for me and definitely not attractive. Her bio was “looking for someone willing to do anything.” I had no intention in partaking in whatever this person wanted but morbid curiosity got the best of me. So I DM her and ask “what are you looking for?” And she said “I’m looking for a group of men to break into our home and force themselves onto my children.” I immediately go into a full on panic attack. I start hyperventilating because I’m so shocked. I calm down and call the police in the town she lives in. I talk with an officer and I tell him I don’t have much info at all but that I want the kids to be safe. He pretty much tells me that if I’m comfortable with it, I need to talk to her enough to get her address. So I sit on it and realize I can’t let those kids, assuming the whole thing was real, live in that environment. I make a new account and message her, and for the next 2 to 3 days I have to talk to her as if I’m interested in the idea, but also without incriminating myself. The stuff I had to read from that monster haunts me to this day. She talked all about how that was a fantasy of hers, how she wanted to go to town on herself while I was forcing myself onto her children. She said she wanted me to tie them and let her have a turn next. Just disgusting stuff. Her kids were somewhere around 4 years old and 2 months old respectively. Eventually I did get her address. I was at work and told my manager I needed to run outside and make an urgent call. I ran to my car and called CPS in her county, gave them her name and address, and a detailed description of what had happened. They assured me they would do a wellness check, and I opted to not receive any updates. My mental state was already messed up from what I had to read for 2 to 3 days straight. I don’t know what ended up happening but CPS did visit, and I hope to God that if there were kids that they were taken away."

He spends the night in the hotel suite with me that night and he's basically having cold sweats. Basically was up all night obviously not doing well at all. He assures me in the morning he'll be ok.

Halfway through the ceremony we are kneeling at the altar when he leans over to me and whispers ""I don't think I'm going to make it”. My eyes get wide and my wife leans in to ask what he said and I respond ""I think we are about to lose him"". As soon as I finished that sentence he started swaying and then just went limp. I grabbed him under his arm to hold him up before he completely slinked down to the ground. Another groomsman jumps over and grabs his other arm and my sister takes over his left side from me.

People with confirmed below-average intelligence, how has your intelligence affected your life experience?

Turns out, all the issues that I had with learning things, memory retention, emotional maturity, that was all affected by the water pressure building up in my brain. I wasn't being a lazy slacker kid, I worked my ass off to pass my classes and graduate, I just couldn't process things well so a lot of it came as difficult for me. In my haze of a memory during the first visit to the neurologist, it was determined that my condition was so severe, I shouldn't have progressed past middle school learning and most people diagnosed with the level of pressurization and compression of the brain as I was were in assisted living facilities just surviving as shells. After needing a second surgery a year later, my brain eventually started firing the signals for mental maturity, but the process was still pretty difficult. Had to learn how I learned best, things didn't process the same way. I've also adapted to overcompensating to make up for the lack of intelligence. Didn't have the work smarter option most times so I just worked harder. It's been about 12 years since the last surgery and I've grown immensely during that time as a person, but the work harder to overcompensate is still a huge issue for me.

Survivors of Comas, what was it like? I was wounded with a knife in the heart in an attempted killing. Emergency open heart surgery later I was put in an induced coma. I was awake and very aware throughout the entirety of the ordeal up until when they cut me open. In my unconscious coma state I was in bed with this lady standing at the foot of my bed telling me I should sleep. When I tried to sit up she conjured a heavy comforter-like blanket that dropped on me and pinned me in bed and said that I shouldn't struggle if I was so tired, to sleep. I remember screaming and screaming under the weight of the blanket just trying to keep myself awake. Falling asleep was the last thing I wanted. Suddenly I was just underwater, in bed but submerged and my screams were muffled. The lady was still at the foot of my bed, her voice unencumbered or muffled unlike my screams which just became garbled and weak and faint. Sleep, she repeated intermittently. Sleep. I can't explain how I did it, I just never gave up. I beckoned and invoked God in the name of everything that is good and in the name of Jesus. I begged the universe to lend me energy, strength from the cosmos to save myself. I bargained and agreed to suffer whatever would result from waking, whatever pain came afterwards. I knew what was going on at this point. I knew this was it, it was hail Mary time. I was running out of options and losing , I don't know how I knew but I was losing. With every ounce of will that I had left I let out a final defiant scream like a toddler that doesn't want to go to take his nap, like a super saiyan transcending his limits. Maybe it was prayer, or bargaining with the universe. Maybe it was simply my defiance and pure stubbornness. The lady vanished. My bed rushed up to the water's surface, or maybe the water level lowered whatever. I broke through the water and jumped out from under the blanket out of the bed. And I woke up, I had a tube sticking out of my face, breathing for me, my doctor and family were there and I couldn't breathe. I didn't want this machine breathing for me, I wanted to breathe for myself. They quickly realized what was going on and rushed to take the tube out of my throat. I thanked God and Jesus and the universe and the stars. I thanked the doctors and the nurses and everything and everyone that I could. I was just so happy to breathe."

What was your high school's tragedy? When I was 14 years old we had a troubled kid. He was part of the cool guys. Always acting out, getting into fights, doing hardcore substances at age 14. He was very interested in appearing cool in front of the older kids he hung out with. As a result one day before school as he was hanging out with them, he decided to do too much blow and went into immediate cardiac arrest. This was at 8 A M in the morning. Just before the cardiac arrest he apparently asked a kid for some water but the kid refused. The next day after finding out that the kid refused to give him some water, the friends of the dude who took the blow found him and hurt him very badly. They yanked out part of his cheek and hospitalized him. As for the guy and the aftermath, what resulted was not an ordinary heart attack, the kid ended up going into a full blown coma. The next day we got a huge talk about drugs, safety in terms of substances. But this was not the end of him or his story. Following his accident, his parents got the police involved and the cops searched the school inside and out for substances. After finding nothing they concluded the investigation. The kid was still in a coma a week later. Fortunately for him, he woke up. However he was left permanently brain damaged and his whole demeanor changed. He never went back to school, he never did anything with his life. He fell into a vicious cycle and started using again. Eventually after getting disowned by his parents, he took a high dose of dope, and forced himself onto his girlfriend and proceeded to take his own life right after. Sure, he was a teenage rebel, but had he not mixed with the wrong crowd, perhaps it would have all been better."

When did you realize that someone close to you was actually messed up? When we were kids we were both abused physically. I only saw his dad once but I knew at least some of the horrible stuff he went through. We were best friends from like 6 years old. Around the time of high school he started to get insanely bad about bullcrapping and bragging. We had a tight group of friends, we both had girl friends who were from our friends circle going back years but this guy would brag and boast about all the women he got when his girl wasn't around. It was very messed up and I had to tell him to knock it off a few times because his girlfriend was my friend too. Well it got so bad his girl dumped him. Then I couldn't stand it anymore either and stopped hanging out with him. Then he joined the army and we all hoped it would fix his attitude a little. Skip ahead about 15 years. He's married and has 4 kids and moves back to town with his wife. He wants to meet up and reconnect. So I agree and while he seems still the same guy, the bullcrap is at a minimum. We have a few good times hanging out. Then I find out his whole life is rented. House, car, sofa, tv, kitchen table, bed, even his kids bikes are on a rent to own scheme. Then he starts replacing things with bigger and bigger stuff. The 60 inch TV becomes a 90 inch TV. Then the bullcrap starts up heavier and heavier. My wife doesn't feel comfortable, particularly around his wife. She can't put her finger on it but she decides she is done hanging out. Now his kids are amazing. His oldest is incredibly bright. Like the kind of kid who doesn't want to watch TV and spends all her time tinkering with electronics and stuff. She was literally the smartest kid I had ever met. All his kids were so well behaved and smart and kind. But by this point I can't take the bullcrap anymore so I stop hanging out with him. For 2 years we don't hear word from them. Then I find out through his mother that he and his wife both were arrested and convicted for forcing themselves onto the children. His mom was taking care of them but there was a lot of DHS and doctor involvement. Apparently it was a long time thing and his wife was involved with it as well. It killed me to hear it. We all knew he was messed up, because of the excessive attention seeking behavior. But those kids were so special and he hurt them. "

We had just come off a roller coaster and I didn't feel like eating at all and because of this she just broke down and even phoned her mom and told on me for not eating. We spoke a lot still over text and got very close. I always thought she would eventually get better and be able to live a normal life. We planned a future together, spoke about having kids and pets. A few more years went by and she got even worse, she would always talk about not being able to do it anymore and how she had lost all her friends. We were never dating but I eventually moved on and got another girlfriend, at the time the relationship was new and I didn't want anything to ruin it, I backed off from messaging how we used to. She reached out a few times after and I ignored her. Around a year ago she ended up taking her life in hospital, when I first read about it I was in shock.

Once you were old enough, what were the dark family secrets you were finally let in on? That my favorite cousin wasn't missing. All I knew growing up was that he would come and go a lot. He lived with us when I was a baby and after he moved out he would visit every 6 months or so out of the blue, but we never visited him or called him. His visits were one of my favorite things in the world. I loved him like a brother. By the time I was a teenager I did understand that he had issues with his parents, they had kicked him out at 13 and my parents took him in, but that kind of childhood messes with you. In between visits to my parents he avoided the rest of the family, moved a lot, and didn't hold jobs for long, which is why my parents didn't always know where he was. But in my later teens he stopped coming over at all. I asked repeatedly if anyone had heard from him and I was told no. I asked about contacting him and was told no one had a number or address for him, he would come around when he felt like it. But it stretched on for years. I really worried he was dead, and I really missed him. In my late 20s I finally found out that everyone knew where he was the whole time. He was in prison for taking the life of the man who forced himself onto his wife. I also found out some super crappy things about how the extended family sided with his messed up parents and refused to help him or his wife when he got arrested. And that they shamed my dad into not helping either. I tried to send a message to him in prison but I don't know if he ever got it.

People who live in small secluded towns, what's a really disturbing thing that happened in your town that everybody knows about? I was very close friends with a girl from high school. This girl had a baby a couple of years after we graduated and woke up one morning to a missing 3 month old son. The family searched everywhere and reported him missing finally when he wasn't found by about 9 A M. The search for him was headquartered at their home where she lived with her husband who was also in our graduating class. Someone went to reheat a cup of coffee after the search for the baby, J, was organised by law enforcement and there he was. J was in the microwave with burns. He had been unalive for some time. After an investigation my friend admitted that she'd microwaved J and blamed it on a newly diagnosed seizure disorder. This was about 20 years ago. Back then, I was a new teenage mom myself and didn't know much. Everyone in town knew that her excuse that she thought she was heating up a bottle after a seizure for her baby boy was crap. She didn't bond with J and didn't seem to want anything to do with him and had never gotten up to feed him until that particular night. Not only that but the baby was big enough that he wouldn't fit inside and had to be stuffed. Bottles don't require arms and legs to be broken to get them into a microwave. She got out of the state psych hospital after pleading mentally Ill and I do believe that was the case. Her own mother abandoned the family with a long history of psychiatric illness. After her son was born I believe that hormonal changes threw her into an acute delusional psychotic episode. She was so sweet and funny before this and I'll never ever forget her flat affect when I asked how she was doing before the police charged her for taking the life of the baby. It was like the girl we all knew was dead. She told me she never had a son and had no idea what I was talking about. I don't believe she was being truthful with me, but I also don't believe she was psychologically well either. "
  husband is concerned as wife shows little interest in their 2-month-old daughter; unsure if parenting style difference or bigger issue.,"I'm worried my wife is not very interested in our 2 month old daughter

I'm worried my wife is not very interested in our 2 month old daughter. My wife, Catherine, and I have been married for eight years. We dated for three years before that in college and have had our ups and downs like every couple. We're both workaholics, very stubborn, and used to getting our way, which can cause problems if we’re not careful. Over time we’ve learned when it’s best to agree to disagree, and when we really need to sit down and talk things out. Unfortunately, I'm really not sure which we need to do this time.
Two months ago, Catherine gave birth to our daughter, Elizabeth. It was an easy pregnancy other than the vomiting in the first few months. Catherine was able to work up to the week before her due date, which was one of those things we agreed to disagree on. She works in a lab, so I had safety concerns, but she did raise practical reasons for staying as long as she did. Another thing we agreed to disagree on was maternity leave. I wanted her to at least take the full six weeks off because I figured she would be exhausted. I had accumulated enough paid time off that I could be home as well, so we could work together to really learn Elizabeth and what she needed. She went back after two weeks, which was more of a compromise than I expected but less than I hoped for. I'd say we work really hard to split taking care of Elizabeth fairly equally. We decided together not to do breastfeeding; with her job it just wasn't practical, and she didn't seem keen on the idea anyway. Every other day we alternate who wakes up for nighttime feedings. I go into work later than her so I take morning duty, but she gets home earlier than I do so she takes evening duty. During the day, Elizabeth stays with my mother in law, who lives with us. When we're both home we share the workload, and that's where the problem comes in. I've noticed that unless Elizabeth is in active need of something or crying, Catherine really doesn't have anything to do with her. Even if she is crying, unless it's for a real reason, Catherine doesn't do anything to soothe her. I know that babies sometimes cry for no reason, and that picking Elizabeth up every time she cries could reinforce the crying, shouldn't she at least pick her up and soothe her a bit? Plus, even when she's not crying, Catherine doesn't interact with her. I've seen her reading more than once while holding her, which I guess is fine but it just seems off? I can't help comparing her approach to my own which is definitely more interactive, or even my mother in law's approach which involves constantly talking to Elizabeth in a very affectionate way. I wonder if this is just a difference in parenting style or if it's something I need to be concerned about now."

What is the most messed up thing you've seen your parents do? My mom aggressively forced a bear hug on a foster kid whose father forced himself onto her repeatedly while her mom held her down. So, my mom is a boundary stomper extraordinaire and abused me all throughout my childhood. I eventually wound up in foster care myself and haven't spoken to her in years. But remembering this, it was the most cruel thing I ever saw her do to anyone who wasn't me. My relatives had a foster daughter who, as I said above, had her father force himself onto her while being held down by her mother. My mother knew this. My relatives made the mistake of inviting my mother over, and my mom said, ""Welcome to the family, gimme a hug,"" to the girl. Who said no. My relatives said no. My mother kept saying, ""But why? Why not? Come on, it's just a hug."" I tried to pull my mom aside to explain why this was a bad idea because neither I nor my relatives wanted to just blurt out the reasoning right in front of the girl. So then my mom just hurried over to the girl and grabbed her in a big bear hug and wouldn't let go while the girl tried to push her off and hyperventilated. To my shame we all just stood there for a moment in stunned silence before running over and removing my mother from the girl, who was now crying. The girl ran off to her bedroom, the foster parents told my mom to get out, then my mom dragged me off to the car and yelled at me for a while. Finally when I could get a word in, I explained to my mother why the hug was so wrong and hurtful. I explained that my mom should've taken context into account. My mom: ""The girl is messed up in the head if she can't even take a hug from somebody nice. And she's probably lying about her parents anyway."""

It was awkward and there were some uncomfortable times like how I had to explain being single and never being divorced but having a house set up for a family. But came along one really nice woman who was looking through some of my photos with me when we came across a photo of my late wife's grave marker and there was my name next to hers. So as I was giving up on all of my life goals, loving partner, kids playing in the yard, travelling. I met this very grounded woman who was witty, intelligent, beautiful and very compassionate. She could look at me and make me feel at ease. She could cry and make me feel like I was what made her feel better. Today we've been married 14 years.

In January, my girlfriend's sister tried to take her life.  Since then, she's been making everyone's lives hell. She has a job, but she usually calls in sick, so she has little money. My girlfriend therefore has to pay her rent for her and give her money for food. Every night, literally every night the sister calls up and wants to talk to my girlfriend about how her life is meaningless and she sees no point in living. Sometimes my girlfriend gets worried she might try to take her life again, and she rushes over. The sister has been to see a doctor and a psychiatrist, but they said she seemed to be no danger to herself or to anyone else. The family has tried, but there's really no help coming. Attempts to get any kind of help have been pretty firmly rebuffed by every professional we've spoken to. What really annoys me, though, is that whenever my girlfriend tries to pull back a little, to suggest maybe that she can't afford to pay her rent this month, or that she doesn't have time to go and hang out with her for hours every evening to stop her feeling sad, the sister starts saying things that make it sound like she might try to take her life again. The other night, the sister came over at 11 PM, saying she was sad. She ended up sleeping in the spare room. Whenever my girlfriend tried to come through to bed with me, the sister acted sad. My girlfriend ended up sleeping in the spare room with her. The sister refuses to speak to her parents. She blames them for a bad childhood. She does, however, sometimes ask my girlfriend to ask their mother to send some money. This might sound harsh, but I feel like this has moved beyond a cry for help and it's become at best a dependent relationship and at worst full-on emotional blackmail. The sister has always been clingy with my girlfriend, and I worry that she's just learnt a new way to get attention.
My girlfriend actually agrees with me on most of this, but she's understandably scared that something might happen anyway. It's gotten so bad that the sister has even floated the idea that she'd be better off moving in with me and my girlfriend, since we have a spare room. My girlfriend and I are both against this, but I fear that it'll happen."
  military veterans recall their craziest story: a fully unclothed barbecue turned into an unexpected gathering with high-ranking officers.,"Military Veterans, what is your craziest story?

Having a fully unclothed barbecue outside the officers mess. All senior officers were supposed to be off station so it seemed like a brilliant idea. We called in some girls from a local nursing college. So the afternoon is going well with loads of unclothed nurses and unclothed small time officers enjoying themselves. Notice a convoy of 6 or so vehicles headed to the mess. Just thought it was more people coming to the party. That was until the doors open and I see a load of people in dress uniform and red epaulettes (senior command officers). Three half colonels, a full colonel and our station commander and a couple of Brigadiers, all with wives in tow. Shit is not about to hit the fan. Shit is about to going nuclear. As I am manning the barbecue at that particular time the station commander walks up and calls my name, he pauses for effect, the silence is deafening, ""got any spare burgers going?"". ""Hell yes we do Sir!"" So we ended up drinking with the divisional command staff. A good time was had by all. Ended up getting called into the Adjutants office Monday morning and given 2 months of extra duties. Someone nicked a bunch of minced beef and sausages and various assortment of barbecue type supplies from the kitchen."
"  soldier's experience witnessing the disrespectful and aggressive behavior of an incoming unit, leading to tragic consequences for an Iraqi family.","Retired soldiers, what was something that you saw or experienced that you never shared with anyone?

I was deployed to a place called the Triangle of Death in Iraq. We had been there for 6 months with a lot of intense fighting and were set to rotate to southern Iraq in a much less active spot. We were set to be replaced by the 502nd IR, part of the 101st Airborne. They had been a large part of the initial invasion of Iraq against Saddam's forces, but this was 2005 and was a much much different war. When you transition units in the military, there is a period where you integrate where you show the incoming unit your current operations. I happened to be at an outpost by one of two remaining bridges across the Euphrates River when this started. We tried to caution them, show them the ropes, but they didn't want to listen to any of us. They kept saying ""we have a destiny"" along with other hyper aggressive statements. They didn't even seem to see the people here as human beings. They were just like ""we're going to mess this place up"". Across the street from this particular outpost was an Iraqi guy and his family who owned the small farm around the outpost. They had been really good to us, pointing out IEDs on roads as well as running and grabbing us food and supplies when we couldn't get any. For example, our supply truck was destroyed by an IED one time so all we had were MREs to eat. We talked to the farmer and gave him a shopping list and money and he bought us food at the local market place. He was a great guy and did stuff like that for us all the time. We took the 502nd guys on a foot patrol and the farmer came out of his house, greeting us as he usually did making his way towards us. We waved and started talking to him. When he went to shake the hand of one of the 502nd privates, the private just hauled off and punched him in the mouth, shouting distasteful remarks. Our platoon sergeant restrained him and sent him back to the outpost with my sergeant and I to escort him while he tried to placate the farmer. We took that private to his sergeant, who congratulated him. When our platoon sergeant got back, he tore them a new one but they didn't seem to care. I wasn't privy to the conversation between my platoon sergeant and his, but it didn't seem to have any impact either. Their attitude persisted until we finally left for our new location. They took the life of that farmer's family a few months after we left and did things to his daughter. As if this wasn't enough, a few months prior to this, I had been injured when my truck rolled over during a firefight (I was the gunner) maybe 200 meters from where the event took place. I had to be medivaced to Baghdad where I recovered for a few weeks. When the truck rolled over, I lost my wallet in the dirt out there in what we called Iraqi moon dust, which is a powdery silt type soil you find all over. Flash forward to a week or two after the event with the farmer’s family took place. I receive a package from Sergeant Green. It's my wallet mailed March 12, 2006, the same day as the event with the farmer. I recognize it's highly unlikely it happened just like this, but I can't help but wonder if they found my wallet on their way to commit the act or even if they mailed it just before it happened. I'm not a religious person, but I like to think that it was perhaps the universe's way of trying to remind them of the front-seat, back seat period with our unit where we had a simple message for them ""treat people with respect and like human beings, it is all they want."" I still have the wallet. It reminds me of the farmer and his family. I can't help but wonder if maybe we had been more focused on getting our message across to that 502nd group if this could have been avoided. Maybe we were in too much of a hurry to leave for safer territory that we neglected something that might have made a difference. "
"  neglected wound infested with flies traumatizes hospital staff, leading to distressing surgery and the patient's unfortunate demise.","Hospital staff, what is an ER moment that has scarred you for life?

My mom used to work in the hospital near our house. She told me there was a brother and sister who lived in a trailer together. The brother was suffering from alcoholism and depression. One day the sister got in a terrible argument with her brother and left the trailer to stay with a friend or boyfriend. It wasn’t the argument itself that prompted her to leave him, but the fact he laid hands on her and threw a beer bottle at her while she was already on the ground. He then proceeded to do blow right in front of her while screaming at her to get out. She was gone for a week or so. However she did not press charges as she said he is the only family she has left. When she finally came back she noticed a lot of flies buzzing around the trailer, and when she walked into her brother's room, she found him alive, but was riddled with flies and insects. He was rushed to the hospital where the doctors figured out that he must’ve been in bed for days drinking, and he must’ve had some sort of an open wound on his leg that flies had laid eggs in and had taken over a large portion of his body. They poured disinfectant on his wound and allegedly hundreds of insects poured out of his wound. They did surgery to try and save his limbs and were finding stuff inside various parts of his body. He passed several hours into surgery."
"  homeless, desperate, lost veins, injected in neck. Arrested repeatedly. Persistent cop led to life-changing rehab. Grateful for transformation.","Former addicts, how bad had it become?

In the late 90s I was living on the streets. I had lost all of my veins in my arms. But I was able to use by injecting my neck with a mirror. I slept in abandoned cars, under bridges, you name it. I did have a decent group of ""friends"" that I ran with which fortunately probably prevented me from being killed. I'd lost my son. Of course I had no job. I'd burnt bridges with my family and I had nobody. I remember there was this one cop that I hated. Every single time he saw me walking down the streets he'd take me to jail. Didn't matter if I had dope or not. He'd grab me and put me in the back, then play alternative rock in his car on the way to the jail, while I'd be kicking the back of his seat and demanding to know why he was ruining my life. ""I'm not the one ruining your life. You are! Why do you keep doing this to yourself? You're better than this. Your life is worth more than this!"" Man, he was tenacious. Well, one day he arrested me for the last time. This was in late 99. My probation officer decided that I needed to go straight into residential treatment from jail. I was full of despair at that point and concurred. 6 months of inpatient in the first part of the year 2000. And the rest is history. My life isn't perfect, but I make a decent enough living and have a little farm where I raise all of my own meat and Saint Bernard dogs. I'm happily married to a wonderful man. I got my son back, he's happy, well adjusted and is going to be a police officer. I have a beautiful daughter who is intelligent and has grand dreams and aspirations. I often think of that cop, that cop that I hated so much. That cop who didn't give up until he saved my life. I'd like to shake his hand, or give him a big hug, and let him know that he made a difference, a very big difference, in the life of at least one person."
"  compton teacher surprised by former students, feared kidnapping but taken to fancy restaurant as gratitude for her teaching.","What's the nicest thing you've seen a gang do?

I didn't see this personally, but about 20 years ago my mother was a 5th grade teacher in Compton. Compton is pretty notorious when it comes to its concentration of gangs and gang violence. Especially in the immigrant district, which is where she lived and taught. It was a pretty average night if you heard between 1 to 10 shots. My mom, being the boss that she is, refused to leave the district or teach anywhere else. Anyways, her first year teaching there she had a group of 5 boys. All of them living in destitute poverty. During break, they loved to draw pictures of cars like Lamborghinis and Porsches. All things that they could never afford. They all promised my mom that if they ever got a car, she would be the first person that they would take for a ride. Skipping ahead about 8 years, my mom was leaving the school late after staying to grade some tests. As she was walking to her car, she saw a shady group of boys leaning against a car watching her. She began to walk fast but the boys got up and began walking towards her. All of them were wearing the telltale blue bandanas and my mom said she could see one who was packing a Saturday night special. Anyways just as she got to her car door the group of boys reached her. One of them spoke in a deep, intimidating voice ""Mrs, we're here to take you for a ride"". My mom thought she was being kidnapped, and reached for her pepper spray. Then another of the group stepped forward and introduced themselves as the 5 boys that she taught about 8 years ago. They squeezed my mom into the backseat of an old, beat up Cadillac between two of the students. They took her to a really fancy restaurant somewhere and paid for her meal in full. Later they took her back to her car, dropped her off, and told her if she ever needed anything to call them. Then drove off."
"  teenage dad faced hardships, turned life around through education, supported child. Grateful for father's dedication despite his own issues.","Teenage fathers, what happened after you found out she was pregnant and what is your life like now?

My dad was 17. When he found out I existed because a friend told him that his one night stand had his kid and was in a different part of the country. He dropped everything, hopped in his car and drove about 14 hours. I was already about 3 months old by then. He looked for me and my mom for a while before finally finding us. She was 16. She was addicted to substances. For the next 3 years it was a rocky ride for him and me. My mom would take me wherever and leave me. She still had custody because the courts are a joke. Eventually my dad and grandmother won me. After that my dad put aside his thug life and went to university and got a degree. And started dating my step mother. From a near criminal to a engineering degree graduate. I don't talk to my mom. I don't even know or care if she is alive. She gave me the potential for mental illness then made sure i would get it through a scarring childhood. She has 3 other kids. 2 of which I don't know. My half sister is bipolar and suffers a lot. But her dad 2 years ago got custody and has been making her life better. Anything that woman touches she destroys. She sure destroyed me. I know what trap houses are like. Been there as a kid. I would have preferred personally if I had just passed when I was born 3 months early, I’m nearly dead from all the mental illness I've dealt with to get to this point. But I'm still here. And I'm taking control of this life one step at a time. But what my father has done for me. I will never forget that. Or take it lightly. Even now. I'm in college studying computer science after being laid off from my full time job and he basically pushed me and my stuff back into his house. No rent. Buying me stuff. Feeding me, for anything and everything he has wrong with himself. For all his anger issues that seep through when he's under stress which can cause him to be quite grumpy. For his gambling problems that he is still working on. For his addiction to cigarettes and his functional alcohol problem. He puts my own life and his other 2 childrens lives above his like a father should. My brother and sister are both doing alot better than I was at their ages. I don't know how I would still be alive without him. Him and his dedication to me."
"  teen accidentally shot and killed neighbor's 7-year-old daughter. Guilt, legal acquittal, and ongoing struggles for everyone involved.","People who have accidentally caused the death of another person, what happened?

I was 14 years old. I was returning from a soccer match with my dad and two neighbours, friends of my dad. Going through my neighbourhood, we met a new neighbour, they had moved in a few weeks earlier. He was returning from a hunting trip, and was unloading a couple of rifles from his car. We said hello, and chatted for a bit. Curious, 14 year old me couldn't take my eyes off the rifles, I had never before seen anything like it up close. He noticed, and asked if I wanted to hold it. Of course I wanted to! My father and one of the others asked something along the lines of ""It isn't loaded, I presume?"". The hunter said ""Of course it isn't!"" and handed me the gun. The moment I took it, it went off. Hitting his 7 year old daughter, who came running from the backside of the house, more or less in the middle of the chest. She passed before the ambulance arrived. She was their only child, and had celebrated her 7th birthday just days prior. The aftermath was a lot of police, investigations and a generally bad time. It felt like I fell down a dark, empty hole, and shut myself completely in. I don't remember much from the years that followed, I existed, but that was it. Legally, I was aquitted, everyone agreed that the hunting neighbour had stated the gun wasn't loaded, and that he practically insisted on me holding it. The hunter himself got some kind of suspended jail sentence. The years since have been bad for most involved. The hunter was divorced from his wife shortly after. I heard he got some kind of depression and apparently has been in and out of a mental hospital. His wife is consumed by hatred, and shows up to threaten me any time she can find me. I have moved repeatedly, and even changed my name, but she still finds me regularly. I have filed several court orders against her, and she is forbidden to come closer than a few kilometres from me, but that doesn't stop her. She has never hurt me physically, though, but she usually says that she'll end me one day. My father took this very hard, and was in a dark place for years. He is now retired, and spends most of his time doing various volunteer work for youth organizations and the like. I know it’s his way of doing some kind of penance. My mother died a few years ago, and was an amazing support for me, even though we never discussed the incident of the girl. I was never able to get back into any kind of meaningful education, barely managing to finish my countrys version of high school. I now live and work with my brother, and I'm doing kinda OK. I never speak to anyone about this, except my father.

"  soldier witnesses a promising young Afghan soldier, full of potential, shot in the face and killed during combat.","Veterans, what is the scariest thing you saw in your service?

Round flew right by my head and hit the ANA guy who was standing next to me in the face.  He was 22 years old, and was born in Kunduz. He had joined up because he wanted to protect his family while saving up to afford visas and passports for his sisters and mother. This guy was sharp. His English was great. And he was a hell of a soldier. I remember this one time we were on patrol when we came under fire: his ANA buddies all started doing that pose where they fire from behind cover without aiming and he ran up to them yelling ""Aim like they taught you! Aim like they taught you!"" He had dreams of going to America and getting into law school, he wanted to ""fight injustice across the world"". He had this little 'catchphrase' I guess. ""For the good of all"" For the good of all. All that potential. All that promise. Gone. Just gone. That beautiful soul wiped away in a split second. And I watched it happen. After the dust settled I made my way back to him. This was the first time I had ever lost a friend. I mean a few guys in my unit had gotten hit before, but up until that point I had never seen a comrade laying in the dirt. It's a haunting feeling. Just a few seconds ago, you were talking about some B S, messing around and making jokes that were often lost in translation. And then they're gone. Reduced to lying in the dirt with their once beautiful mind beginning to clump in the bloodsoaked mud. The scariest thing I saw during my service? I saw the reality of war. Life, in all its potential and beauty, will be wiped away without the slightest warning. Everything you were up until that point will be worth nothing."
"  person's barium swallow test leads to an enormous, solid stool resembling an egg, resulting in a clogged toilet.","I laid an egg

There's a test that you can have done to image your intestines and colon called the barium swallow. Barium is dense and so a great x-ray contrast. You drink this chalky barium mix, sort of like a really gross milkshake, with a slight flavour of strawberry or cherry that makes a mockery of a delicious summer treat. Then they take a bunch of high-res x-rays of your insides in order to see if you've got any messed up stuff inside. So I had this done one day. They recommend taking laxatives and lots of fluids the next day, because it tends to harden up. I was not informed of this. So anyways the next day I sit down to take a poop. Hmm, it seems to be definitely taking its time, ah well I'm not in any particular hurry. Well, it's been a few minutes and goddamn I can tell I have a load of poop to drop, but it's only just starting to poke out after a few minutes. Oh god this is truly a huge one. At this point I'm really working to get this monster out, but it just keeps getting harder to make progress. At this point I'm alternating between sitting straight up and bending all the way over because it seems the only way I can make progress. Finally, all of a sudden , plop,  the behemoth practically empties the goddamn toilet with all the water it splashes from it. Not a word of a lie, the goddamn thing was an off white, and an oblong oval. I laid a goddamn egg. You better believe that the monstrosity clogged the toilet.

Anyway the new guy is being all sweet and she thinks she's falling for him. He smelled of bullshit to me but I didn't want to spoil her new found happiness. Things get to the bedroom and he says he doesn't need protection, he's had the snip. She asked him to wear one anyway and he does For the first 5 minutes. Dude then slipped it off.

Being that she's already had a kid with a shithead and can't afford to have another shithead kid she decides to have a termination and doesn't tell him about it. I fully supported her decision and gave her moral support. When she got home afterwards her ex was waiting for her. He didn't know about the terminated pregnancy or the new guy and said he was there visiting their son. He immediately started verbally abusing her and got physical with her. She didn't have the strength to make him get off of her or stop what he was doing. She sobbed the whole time and he didn't care she was on her ""period"". She didn't tell me about her ex forcing himself on her for several months because she was convinced it was her fault.

"  child raised in a religious cult recounts moments of realizing something was wrong, including abuse, strict rules, and purging possessions.","People who were raised in a cult, when was the first time you realised something was wrong?

When I was eight, my mom dragged me and my three little brothers off from our perfectly normal Methodist church to join an Independent Fundamental Christian Church and enrolled us into the school that the church controlled and ran. I was instantly marked as a Rebellious Child because I had the sheer audacity to ask questions. We were also told that a cult was ""any religion that doesn't believe Jesus is God"". I didn't find out what an actual cult was until I was in college. The independent fundamental Baptist churches in our area were decried as too liberal.  I think my first inkling that something was wrong was either around 2002 when my mother forced me to throw out a pair of shorts because they exposed the welts she'd left on the backs of my thighs, or maybe around 2005, when my mother, along with most parents in the church, went on a ""purge the devil from my home"" binge brought on by an insane street preacher the church hosted every so often and threw out every single Star Wars action figure, DVD, VHS tape, and book we owned. My Lord of the Rings trilogy was tossed because I liked it better than the Bible. My entire life was so messed up that I developed trichotillomania at 11 (which I was screamed at for having) and came down with the shingles at age 14 from the pure stress of living in my house. The OG cult did eventually sort of dissipate when it turned out the pastor was 1, allowing his adult children to do whatever the they wanted in the church including stealing money from the accounts and 2, trying to get close to us teenage girls and a few married women. It still half exists, I guess, but I haven't been to church in almost a decade and now consider myself solidly agnostic. The only upsides to that mess was that I developed a stunning ability to argue about literally anything using the Bible and have an excellent understanding of other crazy religions like Mormonism."
"  an adopted twin brother, plagued by alleged radiation poisoning, committed a series of destructive acts, including theft, violence, and drug addiction.","People with nightmare siblings: what’s the most messed up thing they ever did?

Me and my twin brother were adopted from Ukraine. We were born 1 year after Chernobyl. Not sure if I can make excuses for him due to the orphanage we were in for years, or moreso excuses I make for him due to radiation poisoning.
He has been an absolute monster since birth and is now residing in solitary confinement in upstate New York prison.
As children being adopted by American parents, during our first year here, he took the life of my kitten which was a present to me from my new parents. First devastation of my life. He constantly punched holes in all walls throughout the house. This escalated to hurting me. Fast forward to middle school he was a full blown alcoholic by grade 7 further fueling his rage. Child protective services came in and took him away for a little. However in high school he underwent intensive therapy and was allowed back into our lives to a certain capacity. But I am his twin and I forgive him as he is a part of me! Only him and I understand what we went through.
Fast forward early 20s he became an addict and would steal all of my things to pawn for drugs. Even had me come out to hangout with his friends who were the same as him. He started to get arrested for DUI’s and violence, destruction of property, and so on.
Fast forward to my 30s, I went to college, got a masters degree and my own place and am grateful for the life I have made for myself. I have bailed my brother out of jail countless times. Seriously, I have spent thousands of dollars to help him. I’ve looked for him and found him in motels taking too high of a dose and spent 11 to 15 hours in ER’s multiple times to get him help, I would drive him to rehab for which I always foot the bill. I have picked him up from jail so many times I started to know the police officers on a name basis. I always take my brother in and let him sleep on my couch or air mattress in My own home. He has gone as far as to Call the Police on me in my own home! And I have actually gotten arrested because of him because I refuse to press charges against him but he had this little defence scratch on his arm and this fool spitefully got me arrested to bring me down to his level. Now I have a “ record” but it was thrown out by the judge in court, yes he brought me to court while wanting to live on my couch straight out of jail.
What crushed me was just this past year. I took him in from a lengthy jail stay yet again, I tried to set him up in vocational school to build a future, I clothed and fed him. I did everything to give him stability since we did Not have that growing up in Ukraine as orphans.
One day I went to work and came home and my place is barren. Everything is pawned.
What hurt me to the core was my only prized possession, a locket necklace from our actual birth mother I have had all my life. He pawned that for drugs. I cannot tell you the pain of a heart shattered. I sobbed on the floor as he kicked me in the face to shut up. That’s when neighbours called the police and the state persecuted him and put him away based on his lifelong offence record. I cried when they arrested him and took him away because he gaslighted me all my life that his pain was due to me and it’s all my fault. I believed it because I have normalised it.
I tried to give him the life we couldn’t be given, my own flesh and blood twin. I cannot anymore, it hurts too much. I have omitted many details of horrific stuff he has caused over the years, most I block out because deep down I still love him since he is my twin, but I barely know him anymore. I have lost my other half of myself. I still don’t know why I always keep forgiving him but I think after he pawned our birth mothers locket for dope, he’s nothing to me. Sick part is that I still convince myself it’s radiation poisoning that made him so hurtful since we are twins and I am nothing like him."
"  a friendship shattered: College buddy hid dark secret of murdering his wife before taking his own life, a chilling double life revealed.","What is the darkest secret you've learned about someone that instantly ended your relationship with them?

I was friends with a kid in college, he was from Mexico and missed his family country. At the time my family was living overseas, so we spent a lot of lunches talking about our homes and families. We also both played soccer for the university teams (I played on the girl's team, he played on the boy's), and spent hours hanging out at away games etc.
He had the hots for one of the girls on my team so I set them up together. They went on a few dates, and had a pretty good time. He was a nice guy, a little shy, pretty cute, and really polite.
One day I was in the college lounge and a bunch of us were sitting on couches watching the news. All of a sudden my friend's picture popped up on screen. The reporter said that the night before my friend had ""took the life of his wife and then his own"".
Apparently everything we thought we knew about him had been a huge lie.
I guess he had been married for the last four years to a pretty blonde girl. She worked at a daycare near the school and they had an off campus apartment together. His wife had just filed for divorce, and had presented him with the paperwork that night. He got mad, grabbed a blade from the kitchen and the rest is history. I was told his wife passed pretty quickly, but it probably took a few hours for him to bleed out.
The girl's mom was supposed to meet her daughter the next day, and went to check on the apartment when her daughter never showed up. She is the one who found the bodies.
A lot of people from school went to the funeral, but I didn't. The entire situation was messed up, and this apparently normal guy had ended up being a lying psychopath living a double life."
"  family facade shattered: Seemingly perfect aunt hid dark secrets of her traumatic past, neglecting her own child and causing family turmoil.","What deep, dark secret did you learn about the seemingly perfect family?

My seemingly perfect aunt made my 9 year old cousin reach the brink of taking her life. My Mum's eldest sister is seemingly perfect. She's beautiful, always perfectly dressed, has a very well paying job, 4 successful kids, a husband that basically worships her and what looks to be the perfect marriage.
Only, she's not my biological aunt. And she has an awful lot of secrets. She was adopted at the age of 9 by my grandparents who were very young at the time. They pushed the adoption through because she was being shifted from foster home to foster home, and was being constantly abused. Her growth was stunted and she was very behind in school. My grandparents moved to another city, had 3 other kids and raised her as their biological daughter. She was a model child as I understand.
My aunt got married to her high school boyfriend, and lived in blissful happiness till she got pregnant. I have always thought of her as being a fantastic and loving mum to my cousins, just as she's been a supportive aunt to me. Turns out she didn't want kids though due to her horrific early childhood, and spent her pregnancy isolating her self and hating the baby and she only continued the pregnancy for my uncles sake, who desperately wanted kids, although when my cousin was born, she adored her and spent most of her time with her and they have been very close ever since.
She then had 3 other kids, but didn't cope well with 4 kids and her career, by the time my twin cousins were 9 and my mum was about 5 months pregnant with my sisters and I, she just stopped coping all together.
My parents lived across the other side of the country at that point, and my mum got the shock of her life when her 9 year old niece turned up at the highschool she was teaching at.
My cousin was getting horribly bullied at school and her siblings were almost assisting the bullies. She had tried to tell her mum, but her mum had simply brushed it off, not really understanding the issue. As things got worse and worse my cousin was apparently contemplating taking her life, and in one last desperate attempt to get help had stolen money from her mum to buy herself a plane ticket to get to my mum, who is her god mother and who she trusted more than anyone. I don't know how she got on the plane, I'll have to ask her.
What ensued was essentially an in family custody battle over my cousin. My parents saw the issue, as did my grandparents and my cousins dad, but my aunt didn't. My aunt chucked a hissy fit that my parents were keeping her daughter from her, and refused to acknowledge that she could have done anything wrong. Shortly after this, my uncle gave their other 3 kids to my grandparents to look after as my aunt was so unpredictable. My grandparents did everything to keep their daughter from seeing her kids, for fear of their safety, and this only made my aunt angrier. Her husband threatened to divorce her, as he wanted to be able to raise their kids in safety.
it all finally stopped when my grandmother told my aunt she had never been more disappointed in her, and my aunt made some serious evaluations and changes to her life. My cousins were given back to their parents, and the situation was put in the past."
"  saved by intuition: Heard crying in alley, felt danger approaching. Ran to safety, evading potential harm from a lurking man.","When did a gut feeling save your life?

I came out of a club in my home town after a heavy night of drinking. I was a student then, and out with a lot of university friends, friends that I lost during the night. I was alone.
I was going to get a taxi home, but thought I could do with some McDonalds first.
During my drunken walk towards the McDonalds I heard crying coming from one of the dark narrow alleyways we have in our town. I followed the noise down the alleyway until I came across a woman with her face towards the wall. She had a hood covering her face and had no distinguishing features. At first glance I thought that maybe she had been seriously hurt or mugged. Like why else would there be a woman crying in an alleyway?
Anyway, As I got closer to her in that poorly lit alleyway, I saw 2 giant industrial bins between her and myself. It wasn't until I got within a few feet of the bins that I stopped. It was like a giant shock went through my body. I don't know how to adequately explain it other than a primal instinct. Within 2 seconds of seeing bins that are large enough for people to hide behind, the dark lighting of the alley way, and the faceless woman crying, I was 100% sure I was prey.
I felt an urge to run away. It was like something inhuman in me was telling me to turn and run my legs out of that dark place.
When I got to the light at the end of the alleyway I turned to see if anybody was chasing me. A man popped out of the bins and looked at me."
"  son's addiction to drugs caused turmoil, rehab attempts, wife's tragic death, and his subsequent relapse. Awaiting his recovery and hopeful reunion.","What substance ruined your family?

Dope. I have 8 kids. My oldest son became a dope user. Put him through rehab twice. The first time he walked out. The second time he stayed. He got clean then my wife passed away very suddenly and traumatically in front of all of us. She was hit by a car by an intoxicated driver. I thought for sure that he would relapse. He didn't. He was there to hold me up. Then 3 months later he met a girl who is an addict. I've lost him again to his addiction. So I wait. For any type of phone call or communication. I make sure to follow up on reports of people taking too high of a dose. Keep my ringer on at night and check the jail population every morning. One day he will come home. I know it.
This week has been so incredibly hard. My dear friend lost her son to drugs. I've felt lost and inadequate. Just not enough for all of my babies. And so incredibly worried about my son.

Edit! He came home! On Tuesday afternoon he just walked through the door carrying a box of his clothes. He had been in a car accident and hadn't gone to the ER. So he needed to go get checked out. And he's clean ish. I know that sounds crazy. You are either sober or you aren't. But for now he says weed is helping him stay away from the big stuff. He has slept and eaten non stop for 3 days. We are all so glad to have him back."
"  a father's clever manipulation frees daughter from cult's grip. Patient questioning and religious debate expose cult leader's fallacies, leading to escape.




","Ex cult members, what's your story?

I was never in a cult, but a close family friend was. The father was an ex-cop who got rich trading stocks, he was a multi-millionaire. The man had 4 daughters, all around my parents' age, and they became pretty good friends. He would let my Dad drive his cars and take the girls and my Mother dancing and stuff.
The youngest daughter, we'll call her J, was pretty spiritual. She met a cult leader while she was travelling in California, and fell hard. They did the whole smother the newcomers with love thing really well. She was a rebellious girl, and wanted to get away from what she thought was a domineering father. In reality, she was just a spoiled, silly kid. J never returned from her vacation and she phoned her parents telling them that she's staying in Cali with these people. She would only speak to my Mother and Father or her own Mother. She didn't want to speak with her Dad or sisters at all.
My Father spoke with her, and didn't talk to her at all about coming home, he was scared she'd recoil from that conversation. Instead he asks her questions about how she's feeling, what she thinks of her new friends, and asks about this leader of hers. The dude is a Christ wanna-be, and over the period of several months eventually has J cut almost all contact with everyone back home. They get calls from his minions of course asking for money. By this point everyone is horrified. They also get calls threatening J to study her scripture or punishments will occur.
After a few weeks of silence J calls again, my Father talks her into letting him visit. J's Father is thrilled, and my Dad drives to Cali. Upon arrival my Dad is met by 3 men, and basically shadowed by these people the whole time he's with J. He spends all of his time with her just talking normally, making her feel as comfortable as possible. He never mentions her family, or coming back home, or anything that would cause her to become suspicious of him or his intentions.
Eventually he's introduced to the cult leader, and this is where he makes his move. My Father is very religious, he's Polish, and Polish people are super Catholic. He's a Deacon and has taught bible classes. He starts talking about scripture with this cult leader, and begins putting him into thought traps that the leader can't talk himself out of. This frustrates the leader, and he starts getting upset. J is there the whole time and sees this. My Father just keeps his cool, and keeps tripping up this guy who obviously isn't invested in scripture, but just uses what he can to brainwash his followers. At the end of the conversation the leader slams his hands down on the table in front of my Father, and storms out of the room. He ends up looking more like a child without any real knowledge of scripture than Christ incarnate.
Dad smoked at the time, and so did J. When they stepped away for a cigarette my Father asked her if she wanted to go for a ride. She says, ""I'm not sure if I can"", and my Dad says, ""That's not the J I know"". This, on top of what she just saw her ""Christ"" do, was enough to smack some sense into her. She asks to grab her purse, but my Dad knew if she went back inside she may lose her nerve. He takes her hand, tells her she doesn't need her purse, and leads her gently into the car. He drove her back that day."
"  father reveals he's not biological dad, kept secret to preserve their strong bond. Mother's drug use during pregnancy also disclosed.","What family secret was finally spilled?

When I was 28, I found out that my dad was not my biological father. The news came out via the following: my dad was battling depression and was thinking of taking his life, so I had just flown home to try to take care of him and rescue him from my mom's wrath. My mom had verbally and emotionally abused him during their entire relationship. He loved her so much, and he tolerated it.
Well, during a solemn walk with my dad, as I tried to help him out, he confided that he's not my biological dad, and he went on to tell me he knew this all along but my mom lied to him and tried to convince him that he was my biological father. He knew he wasn't, but he wanted to play the role. When I was 10 years old, my mom finally confessed this to him, and he was worried that upon hearing the news, officially, he'd somehow let this affect his relationship with me. So, when I was 28 years old, during this walk with my dad, as he poured out this story to me, he frames it by telling me that his two most proud items in his life are: 1. How I turned out due to him raising me. And 2, that he had completely forgotten about the news my mom told him earlier in that day (when I was 10), about him not being my biological father, and that it was only upon tucking me in at night (when I was 10), that it briefly crossed his mind. It was at that point that he knew nothing would ever come between us and our father-son relationship would be as awesome as ever.
He also confided that my mom did hard drugs while pregnant with me, and this broke his heart to witness firsthand. They were very poor. My dad grew up in a foster home without parents. My mom grew up with 6 siblings and ill equipped parents. She dropped out of 9th grade, whereas all of her other siblings dropped out earlier many of them are barely literate."
"  therapist identifies sociopathic traits: manipulation, blame-shifting, deceit, lack of accountability, disregard for others, and potential for escalating harm.




","Therapists, what made you realise you were treating a sociopath?

After approximately 30 minutes talking to him during intake, I could tell how well he might be able to manipulate those he believes are dumber than him, and he stated as much. He mimicked my language, posture, he spoke eloquently, and was charismatic. But something was just off. I take note, and move on; I needed more data. And as he continued in the program it became apparent. Everything was someone or something else's fault. Failed relationships, his addiction and particular substances of choice, his inability to hold jobs; no accountability or responsibility. My client had stolen his brother's car in the night and drove it in a ditch and abandoned it; then he lied about it and hurt his brother severely for being annoying. He manipulated other clients and staff, and was good at it, except for a few of us who would call him out in group sessions or through behavioural contracts.
He was my individual client and during a session, I was challenging him because there were inconsistencies in something he shared. Then he finally came clean. He is H I V+. He contracted H I V by cheating on his partner or sharing a needle (he and the person he cheated with shared needles). He had discovered he was H I V+ prior to his partner's return, as they were gone for an extended period of months. He got on treatment, and then didn't tell them at all. Still hadn't at the time I stopped working with him, and I believe they are still together.
Additionally, he shared that he gave substances to his partner, who had a family history of substance use and had never used as much as weed, for his desires, multiple times, sober and intoxicated. The partner would have severe anxiety attacks after intimate acts. You could see his whole body light up in relaying these acts. He laughed and stated that he couldn't believe that they trusted him. A complete disregard for others. 
He completed treatment by going through the motions and is now out in the community. He is young. I have a strong feeling that at some point he will move to even more malicious acts."
"  childhood fear of mom's car accident becomes reality, but she survives and recovers fully from the incident.","What's the scariest gut feeling you had that came true?

My mom is a nurse who works the night shift. As a child I was a worrier, always worrying. In my head I always feared that mom would get into a wreck on her way home from work.
Fast forward to 2006 and I've just walked into one of my classes and my teacher calls roll. He gets to me and says ""Son, you're on the absentee. Says you're supposed to be with your aunt."". (My aunt taught Bio at my high school) I thought that was odd. As far as I knew I didn't know of any reason I'd be excused from class that day. I walked to my Aunt's class and her student teacher told me ""She had an important call, she's in the office”. I knew almost immediately that it was my mom. I knew she had wrecked. At the same time I had that thought, my and my brother's name came over the P A system to report to the office. I started bawling in the doorway and the student teacher probably thought I was crazy.
Got to the office and found out I was correct. My mom was cut off by a reckless driver on her way home at around 7 A M. She spun off the road and into the forest and went down an embankment. She crushed everything on her left side and the woman who ran her off the road kept driving. My mom had been passed out in her car for about 3 hours before a passing motorist saw a headlight reflect in his rear view window. He checked his mirrors but didn't see any other car on the road behind him so he went to investigate and found my mom about 75 yards into the woods. She was in dense cover and her car was black. You couldn't see anything from the road at all and the only reason she was found was because her busted headlight flickered and the man driving by just happened to see it.
She ended up making a full recovery."
"  wife narrowly escaped a dangerous ex-husband's plan to emotionally crush her and take her savings, ultimately leading to his arrest.","What was the biggest bullet you dodged?

My ex husband almost took my life after having a psychotic episode. He told me he wanted a divorce, but I didn’t. He agreed to work on our relationship and give it a few months. We set a date and went to work, and he acted like things were changing and he wasn’t going to leave. He started encouraging me to take out debt and spend money out of our savings.
Turns out that he was lying to me and had every intention of leaving on the date we set and “crushing” me emotionally so I’d hate him forever, and was encouraging me to take out debt since it was all in my name and he’d get half the savings. I only found out his little scheme because he gave me his Apple Watch while he was working on something and I read his messages because I had a feeling something wasn’t quite right. For those of you that don’t know, if you delete a message on your phone, it doesn’t automatically delete from your Apple Watch. I found a few hundred messages to his best friend and mom talking about how much better he could do than me, he had feelings for a coworker and knew she wanted him too (spoiler alert, she didn’t, she’s just a nice lady), he hated me and I was the worst decision he’d ever made, he never really had feelings for me anyway. It was a bunch of savage, cruel shit. Finding it rocked me to my core. I’d never imagined anyone could hate me like that, let alone someone I was married to.
When I showed him the messages, his face dropped. I kicked him out of the house the same day, and on that same day he knocked me unconscious while he was packing his stuff and I woke up tied to a chair. This is all out of some horror movie. I woke up to see him drunk, in front of me holding a knife to himself, claiming he realised he made a huge mistake and I was the love of his life. All it took for him to see that was, and I quote, “you almost bleeding out after I knocked out, some alcohol and three lines”. He told me to promise that we will get back together once he unties me and we can go back to being a happy married couple. I agreed and when I stood up I acted my life out until he went to the bathroom. This is when I ran out the house and screamed bloody murder, he was arrested the same day."
"  parents sided with abusive ex, strained relationship. Moved out at 19. Cut contact after ex showed up unexpectedly.","Have you ever ended a relationship and your parents proceeded not to take your side?

10 years ago, I dated a guy for three years. He was extremely charming. By all accounts he was a great guy, would go out of his way to do nice things for people, always sweet to me, my parents (especially my mom) loved him.
He started lying about things that were really important to me. I was looking for a job. He said he put in a good word for me with the owner of this one jewellery store. I went there to talk to the owner and pick up an application. Store owner proceeded to tell me that my fiancee made no mention of me, and didn't put a good word in for me like he said.
Another example. We had planned to go to a concert in another state, where several of my favourite bands were playing. He said he had bought the tickets and they were at will call. I drove us for 2+ hours to get there, only to find out that there were no tickets in his name or mine at will call. & the show was sold out. He made all sorts of excuses, saying that the vendor must have messed up. Maybe they did, but he had lied too often to me at this point for me to believe him. Hopped right back in the car and I drove the 2+ hours back, in the rain while sobbing.
I think the true last straw was when he lied about having brain cancer. Here's the thing, he went to the hospital pretty often, and it was always coincidently right after we had a big fight. The last time though I didn't drop everything to go see him at the hospital, all of his friends (and my mom) thought I was an asshole. Yeah I probably was thinking he was lying about brain cancer when I didn't know for sure, but it's hard to believe a chronic liar about anything. I found out later (from my mom, surprise) that he didn't have cancer. Turns out the whole cancer shtick, was just a reason to make me feel bad.
He also refused to give me space after we broke up. Constantly texting, calling, and coming to my house. One of the times, he showed up drunk at my door past midnight and started cursing me out, harassing me, telling me how horrible I was, and begging for me to take him back, all in the space of 2 minutes of speech.
My mom let him in the house this time as he had nowhere to go. I didn't want to speak to him, told him that as well as my mom, and locked myself in my room. My mom proceeded to tell him where the key for the lock was (despite my protesting) and he unlocked my bedroom door so that we could talk. He ended up trying to assault me then, I told my mother but she did not believe it.
My mom stayed in contact with him for several years. She always took his side over mine. She refused to meet any of the guys I dated for 6 years after we broke up. I ended up moving out at 19 because of how strained my relationship with my mom became after the break up. I cut contact with my mother when she told that guy where I live and he showed up at my house surprisingly one morning after having not spoken for over two years."
"  person had a wild smoking session, got stuck on the couch, had a sudden bowel emergency, and ended up pooping outside.","What is your dirty confession?

Used to know this guy when I lived at home still in Florida and he'd smoke me out all the time and we'd watch movies and eat some food. And one time I hadn't smoked from in weeks and I decided to take huge hits and clear the bowl as fast as I could. You know. To get my ass up to cloud 9 because back when I was 21 that was essentially my goal.
Anyways, after I cough for probably 8 minutes straight and finally feel like my lungs will keep working (as I've drooled on the table in front of him from coughing so hard) I get legit stuck on the couch. Me and the couch are now one. I was having like strobe vision where the room would begin to spin and then snap back to original and start spinning again on repeat. I knew I had reached Snoop Dogg’s level. And after I continued escalating to the point of being almost uncomfortable in my own skin, not talking, just staring straight ahead basically through the TV not even knowing what was going on.
I feel my bowels churning. Hard. Suddenly. As in bro you're going to shit this is your warning.
Well I'm feeling extremely awkward and I don't wanna have diarrhoea in this guy's bathroom, so I decide it's best to leave so I can walk around his apartment complex for a bit and then drive home when I come down a bit. Solo time. Good time. Let's go.
Halfway down the 4 flights of stairs, I get the worst cramp I have ever had in my life. I'm talking it started in my lower back and ended up making my ass feel like it was being pressed with a hydraulic press. I have to kneel down on the stairs and put my head down, I am just beyond overwhelmed with the pain! What the hell.
I need to get to a gas station, going down the stairs will be easier than climbing back up and awkwardly trying not to shit myself on the way to his bathroom.
By the time I reach the ground floor, I am farting like crazy and it's too late. There is no time left. This must be what it feels like for someone who has no control, this is awful.
I quickly assess my surroundings. Close to 2 A M, nobody should be looking out their windows. There has to be a bush or the side of a building or something. Next to the wall of the complex that towers a good 10 feet or so, I see one of those electrical boxes situated behind a tree away from the parking lot. The poop is coming. I have to go or I'll poop my pants.
Legit took my sweatpants and shoes off and squatted. I sounded like a light machine gun and felt Jesus consume my body and turn me inside out, it was the most disgusting relief I've ever felt. But now I had a new problem. What was I supposed to wipe my ass with?
The shirt that I was wearing wasn't a favourite. I ended up trying to throw it over the wall of the complex, and of course what happened? It landed right on the very top, half on my side and half on the outside, covered in my faeces on display.
The next night I came back to smoke and the shirt was gone."
"  an abusive father's death was not mourned, and his ashes were left in a box before being scattered in the backyard.","When my father died, we didn't have a funeral because he was abusive and we didn't care

My father was the greatest but simultaneously the absolute worst guy. He was an extreme alcoholic my entire life. During the day he was a supporting, if slightly uncaring, good guy who loved his family and worked hard for us. But around 4 pm every night he became a monster. I would close my bedroom door in the early evening and never leave, I could hear him walking through the hallway, trying to find someone to scream at. But if my dad chose to berate me that night, he’d pick something about me and talk in circles about how fucking terrible I was. Like getting a ‘C’ on a report card that otherwise was all ‘A’s or some other minor thing, he especially liked to rant how we never paid attention to him and no one respect him, while his wife and three children all walked on eggshells every night hoping not to be the focus of his wrath.
I left home for the military and chose a combat-oriented job, I decided being in a combat zone was a better alternative than living with my father any longer. The worst part is that he would brag to his friends about how great a father he was because I’d joined the military, never saying he was proud of me, only that he did a good job raising me.
Ten years later, my father has been in and out of the hospital for the last 18 months, he was only 63 but a lifetime of alcohol and cigarettes fucked his heart and lungs. He got lucky on two different occasions, spending over a month in the ICU each time but recovering. I begged him, warned him, eventually he was going to go to the hospital and not come back.
Two weeks after leaving the military, I was staying at his house until I went back to school with my GI bill. He was still abusive, especially to my mom, but avoided me, I think he was afraid of me retaliating.
One day he wasn’t feeling good, I was his oldest child, and the only person he listened to. My family asked if I could convince him to go to the hospital, I did, and this time he didn’t come back. He was cremated and we just left him in a box, not an urn, above the TV stand for a year. We sold the family house recently and we just dumped his ashes in the backyard because traveling to one of the places he loved during life, he was an avid fisherman, was too much trouble."
"  criminal mastermind creates fictitious ship, sells salvage rights, vanishes, leaving buyer with empty hands and legal consequences.




","Who is the most clever criminal in history?

When studying law at university I read a fantastic case in the Law of Contract that contained my favourite criminal ever. 
McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission.
One very clever bunny managed to completely fabricate a cargo ship on paper. So this would have entailed ship birthing documentation, materials, cargo, health and safety checks, payroll for workers, all the licensing and the list goes on seemingly forever, basically, a lot of traceable items.
On this particular ship 'maiden voyage' it 'sunk'. Now for those of you that don't know, there are companies that specialise in salvaging wrecks for materials and cargo, with these bids for the Salvage Rights sometimes going into the tens, maybe hundreds of millions.
So we now have a ship that exists on paper and is completely legitimate and has set sail and sunk with cargo, but was never physically built. This criminal now decides to sell these Salvage Rights to the Commonwealth Disposals Commission who then hold an auction for the rights of salvage. Along comes the unfortunate McRae who buys these rights. McRae assembles his divers, ships and equipment and heads on over to the location that the ship has reportedly sunk, only to find there is nothing there.
McRae must have been furious, so he brought an action against the Commonwealth Disposals Commission for breach of contract and subsequent damages because the contract is between CDC and McRae.
In the meantime Mr Clever Criminal has vanished. Turns out he was a real person but using a bit of identity theft, probably really good at all of this smoke and mirrors facade with practice in making up ships.
In my opinion, maybe this guy is one of the most intelligent people on the planet."
"  police detain abusive father who subjected daughter and her friends to substance abuse, violence, and sexual assault, leaving lasting scars.","Police, who was the worst criminal you've ever had to detain?

The suspect was approximately 40, had a 15 year old daughter. Was an addict, lived in complete squalor. They get evicted and the daughter gets taken into state custody. After a year of counselling finally discloses that her father would give her substances and commit crimes of a violent nature towards her. Therapist comes to us and we bring her in for an interview.
This girl, I believe may have been 17 by now, is no girl. She's intelligent, articulate and lived well beyond her years. She details in remarkable detail how one night her father sticks a needle into her right forearm. This happens several times. One night he is extremely intoxicated, gets her intoxicated. As she is walking into the kitchen he pins her against the wall and forces himself onto her. This begins to happen on a regular basis.
Suspect eventually convinces the daughter to start bringing friends home. Suspect does the exact same things to the daughter’s friends. Daughter continues to bring different friends home so that dad will do those things to the friends rather than her. Eventually when they get evicted the father kicks the daughter to the curb and two of daughters' friends go live out of dad's car in a nearby park.
While these kinds of things happen all the time it was the victim that struck me. When asked why she didn't tell someone she replied, ""The first time it happened when he pinned me against the wall all I could remember thinking over and over: This is my life now.""
This is my life now.
I will remember those words for the rest of my life, as clear as they were said to me. I can still hear the inflection and tone in her voice.
About eight months later I ran into one of the other victims, the daughter's friend. After dad was evicted he lived out of his car with her, she was 15 at the time. Initially she was going to cooperate in prosecution, however, disappeared. She's 18 to 19 now. When I last saw her I didn't recognize her until I saw her identification.

Silly, you're having a nightmare!"" So I smiled at him, closed my eyes and was about to fall back asleep when he started touching my thigh. Two things happened at once: I realised that I was only in my nightwear and that I was definitely not having a nightmare. Fear like I've never felt before gripped every inch of my body and I think I stopped breathing. He started making his way up to my undies. What did I do? I opened my eyes and I said, ""Hold on a second, I have to pee."" He looked shocked, but didn't stop me as I wrapped my blanket around my body and proceeded to take a few steps toward my bathroom. Then I noticed that my bedroom door was wide open, so I bolted. I ran to my mom's room, banged on the door and screamed about how there was a man in my bedroom. My mom came out to the hallway and had just started reassuring me that it was a bad dream, when the guy dashed out of my room and toward the front door. My mom froze, but I got the biggest sense of ""How dare he try to do anything to me?"". That's when I grabbed a lamp, ripped the cord out of the wall socket as I started chasing him, insanely waving that lamp and screaming all the profanities that my 13 year old mind has ever heard. I chased that guy down the streets while my mom called the police. I lost him somewhere in the dark, but when the police came, got statements and started searching the neighbourhood, I got my revenge. They caught him hiding in the bushes, brought him over, and asked me to identify him. I marched right up to that guy, kneed him in the family jewels and walked away saying ""hell yeah I’m pressing charges""."

I used to be a crew chief for the Blackhawks. I was in the Army at the time. We had a training operation in California.
Our Lieutenant Colonel was a pilot who hated the marines with a passion. Never really found out why. So one day we had some time to kill and he had volunteered to take some of the newer marines up to get them used to flying. So we get out to the flightline and get our checks done, only instead of starting up he turns to the Lieutenant and me and says we are gonna have some fun. That we should all just play along. So the marines show up and he just starts moaning about the fact the aircraft won't start. It's too late to switch birds and now he is upset and feels real bad for these marines because he knew they wanted to fly real bad. So the marines ask if there is anything they can do and he tells them the only way to get the bird started is to push start it. Like you would an old Manual transmission vehicle. But you know, the aircraft is heavy and he wasn't sure it could be done. Well that sparks the can do and cocky attitude of the marines. I should mention now there were about ten of them. So I get out and line 9 of them along the bird so they can get leverage to push but not break anything. And I took the tallest who was 6 foot 3 and placed him up front. He is instructed that he will have to spin the main rotor by hand while running to stay in front of the bird. I climbed back in and told the Lieutenant Colonel they were ready and asked if he seriously wanted to do this. He says screw them and yells for them to start. So there we are. Three army guys riding down a runway while 10 marines try to push start the aircraft. Laughing our butts off. They made one trip down, were able to turn the bird around and go back before they needed a rest. And what do you know, while they were resting the bird was able to start. Guess it just needed to warm up a little first."

That guy was a solid man. Military veteran, had his shit together, had a career, and actually loved my nieces daughter. You could tell he really loved them and went out of his way for them. I talked to him once at Christmas and he was all in and he thought they were meant to be because they went to high school together and they found each other years later.
Poor guy got taken for 5 grand, because she was cheating on him the entire time with a 19 year old dealer, who she married about a month after the breakup with the good dude she was with for 5 years. That marriage lasted 11 months and my niece is back living with my sister. Her reaction to all of this?

My sister got married a few years ago to her fiance, and for the wedding day I gave her a puppy as a gift. A few months later her husband suddenly takes her and the dog, and runs off to New York. Takes my sister's phone, and any form of contact she may have and locks her inside the house he built, where he hurts her in every single way imaginable. Getting to the point where he was getting the dog involved in all of this as well and was doing the same thing to both of them. After 2 years of no contact I decided to surprise her on her birthday and with little money I saved up from working in the lab between my college studies I fly to New York without telling anyone all excited. I find out the address we got has never been even built, it was just plot for a building. I began searching everywhere and took a week off school and after finding more about the area from the mail men and police I managed to find another unregistered house this ayy hole built, this was where my sister and dog were kept. I stalked the place for a few nights and then once he left I broke in to find my sister underfed and hanging on by a thread. I found the dog on the floor not breathing, looking like it had been there for a while. Then wait out till he comes back, once he is back I hurt him with a tire iron and then call an ambulance and police. He had a broken knee cap, 7 broken ribs, and tons of other things broken too. Nothing happened to me since I was protecting my sister. My sister’s wounds included burns all over her body. Bruises on every inch of her body and more stuff I will not go into detail about. I immediately got a lawyer and we ended up suing him for a divorce and everything he will ever own. He is currently in prison for 35 years. Our family found out later once we returned home. "
"  person confronts their late brother's girlfriend about her constant discussion of his passing, leading to a heated argument and strained relationship.","AITA for telling my dead brother’s girlfriend to stop talking about his passing?

My late brother tragically passed away in December 2021 at the age of 25. It was completely unexpected, and has been hell to navigate.
His girlfriend and he were never engaged, married, or even living together. She is a lovely girl, and was very helpful to my family and I while we were navigating the first bit of life without him. The problem was she would never stop talking about how he passed. She would go into the details of it constantly, tearing up every time, talking about how hard it was for all of us. Any and every conversation we had, she always brought up how we lost him.
Fast forward to August 2022. It just got worse. She would call herself a widow, which bugged me and my other brother, and our parents. My parents and brother ended up distancing themselves from her, but I kept her at arm’s length so she didn’t feel alienated. I talked to my therapist about setting some boundaries with her, just about how I didn’t want to always talk about his passing. She seemed to take it quite well and was very understanding.
However, two days later, she posted a meme on her story that said, “Little Miss Dead Boyfriend”. My parents saw this and bawled, my brother saw it and was furious, and I was in disbelief. I had friends that followed her texting me and saying she was totally in the wrong for that. We were all super mad, she turned his death into a meme, into a joke, used it for a little pity party.
I talked to her about it, and at first she apologised. Then, she deflected. She ended up telling me her grief was worse than mine because, and I quote, “Her grief was worse than mine because at least I got to know him my whole life.” I told her I needed time, but my family and I would appreciate it if she just stopped talking about his passing. We haven’t spoken since."

","What's your secret that could literally ruin your life if it came out?

For the first 7 years of my life, I was brought up as a girl by my psycho birth mother who really really really wanted a daughter and didn't let the snag of giving birth to a boy stop her from trying to raise one.
She was a pretty successful professional in a legal field (not entirely sure what) and had me via an anonymous nut donor from a fertility clinic. She found out I was a boy at a late ultrasound and then moved across the country. Gave birth to me at home and continued to move about until I was 5 or so. It was just the two of us all my life, we had contact with other people, of course, but they rarely got very close. I had lots of friends, but was always supervised.
I found out way after that my mother's strong puritanical christianity was a lie she used to explain why she was so strict about me being 'private' and never letting anyone see me get changed or anything. I just accepted all of this as fact, having never been told anything different.
I was sent to a religious school for girls and had a really great childhood. i was a bit of a tomboy, and played with lego and toy animals, rather than dolls and stuff, but that's not unusual and no one ever questioned i was a girl - even me. I Knew about men and women, but had never really seen much unclothed people. my mother never ever spoke to me about it, but i kinda had the impression that when I grew up and got breasts and stuff, my pp would kinda fall off or something and I would be a woman, and other kids would keep their pp and they'd be men. I dunno, to be honest, i never really thought about it
Anyway, I carried on with my happy girlhood, and had a bunch of friends and everything was great until i was 7 and a teacher accidentally spilled a cup of hot coffee over me at school. the liquid soaked through my clothes and was scalding me so the staff immediately stripped me out of my dress and underwear to get the hot coffee away from my skin. And then they found out.
the cops were called and i got taken to speak with who i guess would be Social Services. they asked me a bunch of questions about life at home and stuff. meanwhile, my mother was taken in for questioning too. she refused to acknowledge me as male and insisted I was her daughter. because she was, y'know, delusional and stuff, i wasn't allowed to go back home but got put with a foster family and went through loads of therapy and stuff.
The worst part was that literally overnight, I lost everything. my mother, my home, all my toys, all my clothes, i moved school so lost all my friends, they cut all my hair off and told me i wasn't a girl any more. it was really really traumatic.
the first forster home wasn't that great. they had three boys already and going from a sheltered 'religious' only-child upbringing to a rough-and-tumble testosterone-filled environment was really difficult. they tried to force me to be masculine and i was just too confused about what they wanted. anything 'girly' was reprimanded and I felt so lost and alone because nothing I did was right.
i tried to end it all when i was 11 and again at 13 because i didn't feel i fitted in anywhere. After the second attempt, they moved me to a different foster family who were awesome. I consider them to be my parents. they actually stood up for me, the first thing was that they let me grow my hair. from when i got taken into care, they buzzed my hair short, and i hated it. They always had to hold me down and do it forcibly while i was crying and fighting. my new parents flatly refused to do it and said that loads of boys had long hair. they also let me quit karate and football and take up swimming and jazz dance. since i'd been in care, no one had ever stood up for my right to choose what activities to do, or how to dress before. it was amazing.
in the end, i came out of it with a pretty healthy gender identity (i'm a guy, but not the most butch guy ever, but i'm fine with that), I went through school and got my degree and have a pretty good job and an amazing, supportive wife. everything looks great.
but i can never speak about my early childhood, and how i grew up as a little girl."
"  ex-boyfriend exhibited obsessive behavior after their breakup, including a suicide scare. Tragically, he was later found dead under her house.","People with unstable exes, what's the craziest thing they did after you broke up?

This happened to my brother's fiancé, Kim.
A few years before Kim met my brother she started dating this guy named Paul. They were both about twenty three years old. Paul was an eccentric, moody, introverted but apparently charming jazz guitar player whose father was a very wealthy banker type so Paul really had zero financial worries. He also had spent his senior year of high school in and out of a mental hospital for mental health reasons.
Despite being very good looking Kim was his first girlfriend. Right away he was pretty much obsessed with her for the one year they dated. He would follow her when she went to her college classes at a campus 40 miles from where he lived, would call up her friends whom he'd never met and ask where she was, and so on. He started out pretty subtle about this and was able to hide it for a while but eventually Kim couldn't handle his creepy behaviour and erratic mood swings. It broke her heart to do so but she had to break up with him. The guy did not take this well at all, and had some sort of mental breakdown.
At 2 A M a few days after the breakup he showed up at her parents' house where she lived with a sharp object and told her that he was about to take his own life on her doorstep. Kim talked him down and he apparently realised that he was acting insane and left, promising not to scare her again. In spite of all this Kim still kept in contact with him to make sure he was doing alright.
He apparently got much better after a couple weeks and moved out of state to live with his old friends and bandmates. About six weeks passes, she doesn't hear from him. Around this time she comes home and notices an unpleasant smell outside her house. Another day or two passes and the smell intensifies. Her father investigating under the crawl space of the house finds Paul's body underneath the house. He had apparently crawled directly under her bedroom and took too much of his prescription medication. What's worse is that the body contained the final note addressed to Kim. I haven't been told what it said but I don't think I want to know."
"  in Grade 10, the narrator conducted a dangerous chemistry experiment, causing a loud bang and a school evacuation, but escaped trouble.","What did you do in school that should have gotten you in big trouble?

In Grade 10, I was a bit of a chemistry nerd. On days when chemistry was before lunch, I would routinely stay in the lab over lunch and our chem teacher would show us some of the cooler experiments he didn't have time to show us in class.
One day, our chem teacher had an appointment at lunch, but let me and two other kids stay in the lab during lunch-hour to put some extra work in on our lab reports. Since we were typically ""the smart kids"", he trusted us to be unsupervised for 30 minutes.
Naturally, unsupervised kids in a chemistry lab are going to have some fun. I had heard about an experiment where you fill up a container with Hydrogen gas, and light a pin hole on fire, allowing air to slowly enter the container. When the hydrogen air mixture becomes ideal for combustion, the container blows up.
So I found an empty apple juice can in the recycling bin, and proceeded to fill it up with hydrogen gas. I dropped some pieces of Zinc into a light solution of Hydrochloric Acid, in order to make the Hydrogen gas.
So, the apple juice can filled with hydrogen gas. I tapped a pin hole in the top, lit it on fire, and placed it under a desk. About 30 seconds later gas combusts, launching the can directly up into the bottom of the desk, putting a hole straight through the desk. into it.
Normally, this wouldn't have been a big issue, however the combustion produced a very loud bang which caught the attention of the principal whose office lived directly below the chemistry lab. He thought the sound was a gun shot, and immediately evacuated the entire school. We spent the remainder of the day on the soccer field while police searched the students and the building looking for a firearm. The three of us kept our mouths shut, didn't say a word, and never got in trouble."
"  kind Mexican immigrant family aids stranded person on the road, refusing payment and sharing the profound message, ""Today you. tomorrow me.""","What is the kindest thing a stranger has ever done for you?

This past year I have had 3 instances of car trouble. A blow out on a freeway, a bunch of blown fuses and an out of gas situation. All of them were while driving other people's cars which, for some reason, makes it worse on an emotional level. It makes it worse on a practical level as well, what with the fact that I carry things like a jack and extra fuses in my car, and know enough not to park, facing downhill, on a steep incline with less than a gallon of fuel.
Anyway, each of these times this shit happened I was Disgusted with how people would not bother to help me. I spent hours on the side of the freeway waiting, watching roadside assistance vehicles blow past me, for A A A to show. The 4 gas stations I asked for a gas can at told me that they couldn't loan them out ""for my safety"" but I could buy a really shitty 1-gallon one with no cap for $15. It was enough, each time, to make you say shit like ""this country is going to hell in a handbasket.""
But you know who came to my rescue all three times? Immigrants. Mexican immigrants. None of them spoke a lick of the language. But one of those dudes had a profound affect on me.
He was the guy that stopped to help me with a blow out with his whole family of 6 in tow. I was on the side of the road for close to 4 hours. Big jeep, blown rear tire, had a spare but no jack. I had signs in the windows of the car, big signs that said Need a jack and offered money. No dice. Right as I am about to give up and just hitch out there a van pulls over and dude bounds out. He sizes the situation up and calls for his youngest daughter who speaks english. He conveys through her that he has a jack but it is too small for the Jeep so we will need to brace it. He produces a saw from the van and cuts a log out of a downed tree on the side of the road. We rolled it over, put his jack on top, and bam, in business. I started taking the wheel off and, if you can believe it, I broke his tire iron. It was one of those collapsible ones and I wasn't careful and I snapped the head I needed clean off. Shit.
No worries, he runs to the van, gives it to his wife and she is gone in a flash, down the road to buy a tire iron. She is back in 15 minutes, we finish the job with a little sweat and cussing (stupid log was starting to give), and I am a very happy man. We are both filthy and sweaty. The wife produces a large water jug for us to wash our hands in. I tried to put a 20 in the man's hand but he wouldn't take it so I instead gave it to his wife as quietly as I could. I thanked them up one side and down the other. I asked the little girl where they lived, thinking maybe I could send them a gift for being so awesome. She says they live in Mexico. They are here so mommy and daddy can pick peaches for the next few weeks. After that they are going to pick cherries then go back home. She asks if I have had lunch and when I told her no she gave me a tamale from their cooler, the best tamale I have ever had.
So, to clarify, a family that is undoubtedly poorer than you, me, and just about everyone else on that stretch of road, working on a seasonal basis where time is money, took an hour or two out of their day to help some strange dude on the side of the road when people in tow trucks were just passing me by. Wow.
But we aren't done yet. I thank them again and walk back to my car and open the foil on the tamale cause I am starving at this point and what do I find inside? My $20 bill! I whirl around and run up to the van and the guy rolls his window down. He sees the $20 in my hand and just shakes his head no like he won't take it. All I can think to say is ""Por Favor, Por Favor, Por Favor"" with my hands out. Dude just smiles, shakes his head and, with what looked like great concentration, tried his hardest to speak to me in English:
""Today you. tomorrow me.""
Rolled up his window, drove away, his daughter waving to me in the rear view. I sat in my car eating the best tamale of all time and I just cried. Like a little girl. It has been a rough year and nothing has broke my way. This was so out of left field I just couldn't deal.
In the 5 months since I have changed a couple of tires, given a few rides to gas stations and, once, went 50 miles out of my way to get a girl to an airport. I won't accept money. Every time I tell them the same thing when we are through:
""Today you. tomorrow me."""

","Redditors who lost their Job because of a post to a social media platform, what happened?

Worked at gamestop until 2010. The store was in a mall and parents would always leave their kids in the store and go do their shopping. Sometimes the children would cry, sometimes they'd pee themselves, even had one number 2. Parents would get mad at us for not bringing them to the bathroom(What the hell) or start screaming at their kids for not just playing games for a few hours without causing any problems. I tweeted about how the store wasn't there to babysit children and never really thought about that tweet again until a Few months later, same thing. Parent drops the kid off in the store, leaves. 20 minutes later, an older looking guy is outside the store, on his flip phone, aiming it at the store. He's creeping me out but I continue offering pointless warranties to customers while waiting for my next break and then, I noticed him walk near the entrance of the store and ask that kid where his parents are. This seemed really fishy and the guy looked beyond suspicious, I was thinking he could be a creep and I was right. He gets the kid to go with him, I call up mall security so they could check it out and they caught him before he left the mall. He was arrested, the kid was crying, asking for his mom, Who mall security could not reach because as it turns out, she went to some stores outside of the mall area and she didn't actually come back for another 2 hours, at which point she threatened to sue me, gamestop, the mall. Security guard lady told her that child services were called, and they all walked away(That was the last time I saw them.) Few days later , District Manager(DM) shows up in store and I was fired on the spot because that lady made a complaint, DM found my twitter and informed me that my approach to yesterday's dilemma and my tweet about how Gamestop isn't a babysitting service has made them believe that I don't have the ""Gamestop spirit"". Both the manager and district manager told me I could use them as a reference on my resume though, which was great until they both lost their jobs a few weeks later."
"  starbucks coworkers. He comforted her during a pregnancy scare, became friends, and eventually married with two kids.","How did you meet the love of your life?

How did you meet the love of your life? So I used to be a shift manager at a Starbucks when I was 19, and had this 17 year old coworker (a really cute girl, WAY out of my league). We usually ran two-person shifts back then (a register person and a barista on the machine). A couple of months after we hired her, we had a busy day where I was on a morning shift, and she came in for a midday shift. She took a personal phone call and came back to the espresso machine all teary eyed. We had a huge line, but I told her to go take an extra break (it wasn't just to be nice, the customers were looking at her funny). She didn't want to abandon me with the big line of customers, but I insisted. Ended up killing the line by myself. After my shift was over we got to chatting in private about what was happening. She was hysterical,  and it turned out that her period was very, very late and she believed she was pregnant. The personal phone call was her boyfriend freaking out and dumping her. Now at this point in my life, I'd had my fair share of pregnancy scares (probably a little of your fair-share too; I was a really dumb kid). So I talk her down, and ask her if she's taken a pregnancy test to confirm yet. She hadn't, didn't know how, and didn't have the cash or the courage to go to the drug store across the street and get one. So I hung out for a couple of hours until her lunch break (it was a Barnes & Noble Starbucks, so there was plenty to do without looking like I was waiting FOR her), then escorted her to the drug store and bought her a two pack of tests. She messed up the first one, so I brought her a cup from the cafe to use on the second one (I had an ex who could never hit the stick, so would pee in a cup and dip the test in the cup). Lo and behold, she was NOT pregnant, and couldn't have been happier or more grateful. We stayed friends for years after that, even after I took a promotion and moved out of town. All because I was a dumb kid who knew how to advise another dumb kid with my own lousy life decisions as an example. True story, though: a few years later we started dating, and then we got married. We've been together for nine years in November and have two kids. Bought our first house together a couple of weeks ago too."

","AITA for telling my daughter to get over what happened in the past?

Am I the ayy hole for telling my daughter to get over what happened in the past? I have one daughter Ella with my ex, Dylan. Dylan and I amicably divorced when Ella was only 4 years old. Few years later I married my now husband Jack. He was a single dad of 2 kids, Jason and Sophie. Jack and I also have a daughter, Bella. This is about Sophie and Ella. I always thought since they were closer to the age they would get along really well. And I was right. They were like best friends and we were really happy in our blended family. When Ella was in college, she met this guy Bryan at a cafe where she worked. They started dating. I was happy for Ella. Bryan proposed to Ella in front of our whole family and it was very romantic. Everything was fine until one day Ella came to our house screaming at Sophie. She claims that Sophie has been sleeping with Bryan. I told her she must be joking. Sophie would never do that to her. There was a lot of screaming until Sophie finally said that she and Bryan are in love. This caused more commotion. We did have an extremely hard conversation with Sophie. She showed her remorse and was very guilty. We tried to talk to Ella. That Sophie was sad and maybe she should forgive her. But Ella was having none. She went on to more screaming and bashing all of us that we are abandoning her and picking Sophie. That is not the case. I tried to make it as peaceful as possible but Ella didn’t want that. When Ella and Bryan broke up, he started dating Sophie. They got engaged within a year. Sophie wanted Ella to be her bridesmaid. But Ella just said ""Over my body"". I thought it was really cruel of her to say that and she is being petty by holding onto the past anger. Needless to say she didn’t come to the wedding. Rather she left the city to live with her father. She didn’t contact us much except for Bella. I thought she might need sometime to cool off. But I was hurt that she kept us out of her life. We only got some insights from Bella and Jason. She only sent me cards on my birthday but hardly ever spoke to me. I think it was unfair. One day she came to our place. Sophie and Bryan were also there. She gave us an invitation card to her wedding with someone named Ray. I don’t know much about him. She didn’t even include us in the wedding party. Plus the venue was a 4 hour drive. And the hotels in that area are expensive. We did agree, but at the last moment Jack got sick and I had to cancel it. When I told her the reason I cannot come to her wedding she told me to not bother. She made the right choice by not including me in her wedding. She knew I was a bad mom. It really bothered me. I always wanted to be by her side. But the place and time she was getting married was not compatible for us. That was 2 years ago. She never contacted us again. Few weeks ago, my daughter Bella showed me a post on Instagram that Ella was pregnant. She posed with her stepmother with a caption like she will be a good grandmother. I was furious. How can she forget her whole family here. So, I called her from Bella's phone and wanted an explanation. She replied that since I never bothered to be at her wedding, I don’t deserve to be in her kid's life. She said it is not just her wedding. She claims I have never been supportive of her. That I don't care about her. She went on to blab that she never felt like she had my support. Even when she got cheated on and I chose my stepdaughter over her. I told her it was not fair for her to hold that against me till now because it was 6 years ago. She has moved on and Sophie has moved on as well.

For as long as I can remember in my family, almost any time I got up from my seat someone would take it to either be funny, or to claim it as if no one was using it. And as a teenager it literally got to the point I bought my own folding chair so I could pick it up and carry it with me. If I left it where it was, someone would take it. Then get mad when I wanted it back. As an example, on a holiday last year I got up from my chair for a moment to help with something and came back to find a kid in it. And then the family berated me for wanting them to move. But I tell them that when a man owns and brings his own chair, they expect to be able to use it. I own a very nice folding chair that's comfortable and easily portable. And I pretty much bring it to any family events because people are always scrambling for chairs. Well the other day I went to a birthday party for my nephew. And like always I brought my own chair. But at some point I had to use the bathroom. When I came back my chair was gone. And everyone acted like they didn't know where it was. I said they had one minute to return it or I was leaving. They laughed at first, but then realized I was serious as I started going for the door. Everybody told me to just calm down, and it was just a joke. I said I don't care if they think I'm a stick in the mud. I wouldn't be bringing my own chair all the time if other people weren't always taking my seat when I get up. I don't think it's funny, I never did. My brother in law then pulled the chair out of where he'd hidden it, and when I got it back one of the legs was bent. I said it was not like this before, and how could he possibly have done this to a metal chair. He said he could fix it and tried to unbend it, but only made it worse. The chair is pretty much unusable now because the leg is warped and I don't want to risk putting weight on it. I told my brother in law he owes me $50 for the chair because that's what I paid for it two years ago. He got mad and kept saying it was just a stupid chair. I said it was my stupid chair, and this wouldn't have happened if he wasn't so immature that he and everyone else had to mess with me for years about where I sit. Then I took my now messed up chair and walked out. My family has been blowing my phone up saying that it's just a chair and to let it go. But I still want my brother to pay me back for it."

My family sucks. I turn 18 in 2 weeks and I’m getting out of here as soon as the clock strikes midnight. My parents have extreme bias towards my younger brothers. It’s been like this forever. I have no idea why. I’ve always been the one who had to do all the chores in the house. I also have always been forced to play every single sport I possibly could to the point where my schedule was packed 365 days a year. My father told me it would teach me to be a real man. But my brothers never had to do any of that shit. They’re both lazy people who sit around and play video games all day and all night. They miss school at least 30% of the year and are constantly spoiled rotten by my parents. They already have thousands of dollars from birthdays, Christmas, and other holidays. As soon as I turned 12, I was told I would no longer ever be receiving gifts from my parents other than “bare essentials.” I was told I had to pay for my phone and any other expenses I wanted to own and to never ever ask for anything. I wasn’t able to own a phone or anything really special for myself until I was 16 because I couldn’t find any actual jobs that paid good money. My parents also expect me to take care of my younger brothers when I’m an adult. My younger brothers have both decided they will not be going to college and do not plan on working a day in their lives. My father told me “we kept you alive, you owe it to us.” I’m leaving a nasty letter on the table when I leave and changing my phone number, emails, and everything. They will never be able to contact me no matter how hard they try. I know my younger brothers are gonna be screwed for life since they have zero experience on how to survive in the real world but I don’t care. That’s my parents' burden now. I hope they go broke from having to fund my brother's lifestyles and I hope they lose everything. I have no sympathy for these people and I will never feel bad no matter what happens to them. The only thing I owe to my parents is the fact that because of the shitty treatment over the years, I am well capable of surviving on my own in the world. I’ll be going to college to study finance in Virginia, and I’m also very physically fit due to playing 6 sports a year. However the trauma will never go away.

"  wife's husband suspects being ""baby trapped"" after learning about a friend's situation, causing trust issues and marital conflict.","My husband thinks she babytraped him

My husband and I have been married for seven years. He lived next door and we just clicked, it was like a fairytale. One thing I have always thought made our marriage so strong was our friendship with each other and our trust in one another, although now my husband seems to think otherwise. Recently, my husband found out that his friend, Geoff, has been baby trapped. Basically, Geoff's wife stopped taking the pill and fell pregnant a few months into their relationship, and only came clean after the wedding. Geoff came from a very conservative family, which his wife knew, and so he felt obligated to marry her after the pregnancy. Unfortunately, he also now feels obligated to stay regardless of the clearly messed up dynamic because he feels that he has made a vow and will stick by his wife and child. My husband, for some reason, has been really rattled by this. I am currently four months pregnant with our first, and my husband asked me yesterday if I was trying to baby trap him. I first laughed because I honestly thought it was a joke. He was dead serious and doubled down, so I told him that we have already been married for seven years and a baby was not going to 'trap him' any more than he already is. My husband did not like that answer and said that there was no time limit on baby trapping, and that my intentions were clearly not pure given how I was acting as if his concerns were a joke. He said he had trusted me in the past, but me laughing in his face gave him no reason to trust me now. I did not really know what he wanted or how I was meant to respond, and I said we should talk about this in the morning.

"  misunderstanding about free hair services created tension between woman and boyfriend's mom, making woman reconsider attending a family dinner.","My boyfriend’s mom came into my work today and I don't know how to tell him

I have been dating my boyfriend for a year and a half. Things have been really good and he is my best friend. I also get along really well with his family as he does with mine. I go to a cosmetology school currently and I hope to become a hairstylist in the future. I have done my family's hair as well as my boyfriend's family for free when I am free. For example, I did my boyfriend's little sister's hair for her junior prom and have done his moms twice for weddings. I do not charge them because I am not on the clock and because I didn't want to accept their money when I offered to help in the first place.
On Saturday, I had a woman come into my school/salon and ask for me to do her hair. For some info, students at my school are allowed to do people's hair and people can come into the salon and get their hair done by students. The prices are a lot lower but obviously, are done by newer, less experienced stylists. We do get a lot of customers, most of my friends come in and sometimes even my boyfriend. So anyways, the lady comes in and asks for me. I wasn't working on anyone so I gladly helped her out. We ended up doing a full scalp treatment plus a cut and blowout plus styling. For salons in my area, this would be anywhere between 60 to 80 dollars. At the place I work at, this was only $20. When she was all finished, I brought her to the front and gave her the total. She looked at me and said ""Aren't you N's girlfriend"" I didn't know who this woman was but I said ""Oh yes I am"". She then said ""N's moms name said you work here and you don't charge family members. I didn't bring any money"". Again, I have no idea who this woman is and I have never said anything close to that. I told her that I am currently a student and do work here, but our school and company does charge. She was like ""No, I just spoke with her and she says you do family and friends hair for free"" I told her that while I have done some family's hair as well as my boyfriends family's hair for ""free"" I have done it at their or my house when I am off the clock. No matter what I told her, she would not listen and my salon owner had to come forward and help the lady. She basically told my manager that I said I have a family discount and now I'm making her pay even though I told her she didn't have to. Thankfully, my manager heard our entire conversation before she came over and basically told that's not true. The woman did have money and threw a $20 bill on the counter before she walked out. I apologized to my teacher but she told me not to worry. About an hour later, my boyfriend's mom showed up. I was working the counter at this time so I was free to talk to her. I was about to tell her about the woman from earlier but she kind of started talking right away. She said ""My friend just told me what happened, I'm not sure what to tell her."" I told her I wasn't sure what she meant and told her what happened. Apparently, she knew what happened and everything that lady told me was true. To summarize, my boyfriend's mom was talking to her friend (the lady) about where to get their hair done. She told her friend about me and how I do hair at a salon for a cheap price. She then told her friend to tell me that she knows my boyfriend's family and that I wouldn't charge her. I said to her that I have no control over prices and that I have never done work for free. She told me that I do her and her daughter's hair all the time for free and that she assumed I'd be nice enough to lend a hand to other people they are close with. I told her I don't know why she would assume that as this is my job and I'm still in school. I also told her that the times I've done her and her daughter's hair, I've done it at their houses when I wasn't currently at school. She ended the conversation by saying that I'm just a student and she doesn't understand why I would still need to get paid when I still have a lot to work on. She said “N says a lot of sweet things about you and I was really looking forward to other people meeting you. I now have to go around telling my friends that you are actually sweet and we do actually like you. But it's fine I guess I'll see you soon” and then she left. The entire time she was very passive aggressive and very fake nice? I'm honestly at a loss for words right now. Throughout my entire time dating N, I have never once gotten the impression that she didn't like me, and she's never acted like this to me before. I'm supposed to have dinner with him and his family on Wednesday, but I'm not really sure I want to go anymore. I don't really want to see her and I feel a bit awkward and uncomfortable."
"  brother arrested in Norway for assault, family seeks legal assistance, facing communication challenges, uncertain about his release and deportation.




","My brother is being detained In Norway

My Dad and brother are on vacation in Oslo right now. My brother was arrested last night. Police and my brother have been very vague on what happened but I know he was drinking heavily and may have resisted arrest (said he thought he was being kidnapped). My Dad and I have attempted to contact the US embassy as we are not familiar with the Norwegian laws but unfortunately they are closed on Sundays (even for emergencies). After calling about twenty different lawyers we finally were able to reach someone but they said they can't represent my brother without speaking to him but we have no way of contacting my brother. Edit: Brother called my dad. He has been charged with intoxicated and disorderly assault. Apparently fought the police as he thought he was being kidnapped when they tried to kick him out of the bar. Signed a plea deal with the help of a lawyer for $1800. Was under the impression after that he would be released but has now been transferred to an immigration facility. edit two: I am truly embarrassed by his actions and think he deserves whatever the Norwegian government deems fair. In the US he would be going to jail for two years for these crimes so anything less I feel he's getting off easy. My Dad was able to locate the ripped passport at the bar and took it to the immigration facility near the airport. I still have no idea why my brother ripped it. The US embassy is closed till 8 AM but as of now it seems he will be deported tomorrow edit 3: My brother is still being held at the immigration facility. Unfortunately there has been no definite answer from the lawyer as to what is happening. The embassy is involved and we are hoping he gets sent back to the US some time today. My Dad apparently has moved on to Sweden. Based on what everyone had originally shared I am shocked he is still being held. Whatever happens I hope my brother and family will have answers soon."
"  unbeknownst to them, the person ingested mold from a neglected water filter cartridge in their Keurig coffee maker, causing health issues.




","I ingested mold for a year

So I have one of the keurig coffee makers. I use it everyday to make hot chocolate. Well, it was cold last week as we just had a snow storm so instead of having one cup of hot chocolate like I normally do, I had three. So this required more water to be added to the reservoir. So I added the water and I noticed something black on the lid. It was mold. I looked inside and saw a lot more mold. Last year, I bought one of those fancy water filter kits for it and installed it. You’re supposed to replace them and I even put an alert for it in my phone. But I set the alert to none so I never got it. So for the last year that water filter cartridge has been sitting in water getting moldy. Now, you’re probably wondering how I never noticed the mold in the reservoir. Well, I’m short and have it at an angle in the kitchen so I always just use the hose from the sink to fill it up. My memory isn’t great so I forgot I even had the water filter in there. I assumed by using the machine everyday it would stay somewhat clean inside it. Sometime, last year my husband told me he didn’t want coffee from the keurig anymore and he started using a regular coffee maker. I continued using the keurig. He told me it tasted weird but it never bothered me. Around November, I developed a bad cough and that eventually turned into a sore throat, nasal congestion and pain, as well as daily headaches. Oh, and my vision became blurry. These symptoms just never seemed to go away, and I know now they’re from mold exposure. I’ve since cleaned the keurig, but I’m pretty sure I have an aversion to using it so I’ll probably just get rid of it. It’s been a week since I’ve had anything from the keurig and all of these symptoms have disappeared."
"  person reluctant to introduce his girlfriend to his parents, fearing their judgment about her weight, he struggles with navigating the situation.","I've been putting off introducing my girlfriend to my parents because they’ll be weird about her weight

I have found what could very likely be the girl of my dreams. I could accurately use any cliche in the book to describe this woman. My world went from black and white to color when I met her, she knows me better than I know myself, and I feel complete for the first time. We’ve been dating for two years. We’re planning to move in together. She’s never met my parents, and it’s starting to become obvious that I’m putting it off. I keep putting it off, because I know my parents won’t like her. My parents have very antiquated views about what a woman should be and one of those things is thin. My girlfriend has an eating disorder, she is 5’2 and roughly 200 pounds. My family thinks if a woman is overweight it means she’s infertile, self centered (doesn’t care if her man finds her attractive), inactive, poor impulse control, and not a contributing member of society, I could go on and on. First of all, my girlfriend has been an athlete her whole life and competed at a national level all through college. She went to an Ivy League school, graduated with Latin Honors, and is the youngest person to ever have the job she has where she works. She’s unbelievable. She’s so used to being the best and succeeding at things that her weight is a major sticking point for her and something she is very sensitive about. I don’t know how to handle it with my parents if they make a comment (they did it to my brother’s old girlfriend, no reason to believe it won’t happen again) or if they’re just generally hostile. I’ve told her my parents are from a different time and place and are very based and whether or not they like her will have no bearing on how I view her but I still don’t know how to handle this. My girlfriend really wants my family to like her since we’re going to move in together and I don’t know what to do about this. Usually we talk things out very directly but her eating disorder stems from a traumatic period in her life so discussing it has to be handled carefully and I’m not sure how to basically say “my parents are kind of morally bankrupt in some ways” without ruining any chance of a relationship between the three of them."
"  date shares food, chats, and smokes a joint with homeless men at a train station, showing compassion without seeking validation.




","What was the most disgusting thing your date has ever done?

I had just been at a club. This girl I was dating had popped some pills earlier and was pretty intoxicated and we're walking to the train station because we're on the same line and it's almost 4AM and we are both exhausted. She'd taken off her heels and is walking barefoot in the middle of winter and is talking about the time she broke her arm falling off the monkey bars in school. Suddenly she decides she wants to hit up this 24 Hour burger place on the way to the station. We get there and she buys me a burger because I'm short on cash but she also buys five extra burgers and fries and at the time I was teasing her about how much food she bought. Very casually she mentions that they're for a friend and when we get to the station she walks over to a couple of homeless dudes and sits down next to them and starts chatting like they've known eachother their whole lives. It was a bit awkward for me, I had never spoken to a homeless person and these were proper homeless people, like they smelled pretty bad, and were missing half their teeth. They were nice guys, but boy it was a new experience for me. Anyways, so we're eating burgers with these stinky homeless guys and then they light up a j and share it. The fact that she shared a j with these toothless people really grossed me out but I stuck around. When our train was only a few minutes away we said goodbye, and I spied her slipping them some cash after hugging each of them goodbye. We got on our train no problems, and I ask her how on earth she was good friends with random homeless people and she laughed it off saying that she usually chills with them when waiting for the train. It was crazy to me, she had done something wonderful for another person like it was no big deal at all. It really put me in my place when I realised that I would otherwise had never even looked at someone like that. She didn't seem to care at all about the entire exchange and that moment sticks with me as an example of someone doing something good without needing any kind of validation."
"  friend strategically avoids work, manipulates time sheets, refuses to sign agreement, gets fired, receives pay, and unemployment benefits.","What is the greatest act of not giving a crap you've witnessed in a public setting?

I worked for a call center for a time, and a friend from my original training class was getting tired of it after a couple years.  This is a guy for whom life has basically gone: job, large savings, no job, whittle savings, rinse repeat.  He lives totally minimalistically the whole time, so he came to this job after two years of Neet life.  And to Neet life he was prepared to return, a hearty three years worth of savings under his belt. He told me he was tired of the bullshit, and he didn't want to keep working. I liked having a friend at work with his attitude, so I convinced him to instead make them fire him.  He agreed, and began a very linear scale of laziness.  The first week, he began a strict regiment of call avoidance.  He would come in, abuse the phone status changes, take maybe one call, go on his first break, come back, take maybe one more call, go on lunch, etc.  For a full week he took four or six calls a day, and no one said a damn thing.  The second week, he took basically no calls.  He did a great job of looking busy when important people came by.  Somehow, his supervisor did not come to talk to him, and the people who monitored phone stats either overlooked him or were investigating a phone anomaly. The third week was where he really shined.  We were responsible for our own time sheets, as represented on the employee website.  He would come in at the start of his first break, go on break, take no calls, go on lunch, take no calls, go on break, and leave.  But on his timesheet, he put his normal start and end times, to get paid for a full work day. The Friday of week three is when they finally came for him. I was so proud of my boy when they laid down a piece of Word Doc in front of him to sign, stating he would relinquish his pay that he did not earn - which he promptly refused to sign.  Since they could not compel him to sign it, the supervisor got irate, and walked him then and there. Thing is, if you're fired, you have to have an exit interview.  He didn't get one, so they had to call him back in, pay him for his time, and exit interview him properly.  And then of course he got unemployment to supplement his savings.  He did so well he moved to Colorado. And if anyone is feeling like this company didn't deserve that level of scamming, I'm happy to report: it was Comcast."

Not me but happened to a friend, his girlfriend had been taking trips to a specific city for months because her mother had been diagnosed with lupus and apparently needed a lot of care. One day, before leaving for another trip to go see her mother, she broke up with my friend because she felt she “was being a bad gf and couldn’t devote enough time for him.” My friend takes it like a champ and wishes her the best. She even leaves the door open for a possible continuance of their relationship once her mother gets better. She even spends that weekend texting him about how hard it was to take care of her mother and how she had gotten no sleep because she spent the night at the hospital. This whole time my friend is being crazy supportive and texting her studies on lupus and all this other stuff. A few days later my friend is randomly checking his facebook and sees one of those 360 degree panoramic pictures posted by someone that he knew had also had a fling with his ex. The picture was taken at popular music festival that happens to be around the city his ex’s mom lived, so my friend pans around and... yup, there’s the ex, partying it up. Turns out instead of visiting her sick mom she had gone to this music festival instead and hooked back up with this guy. He found pictures of her there all weekend which means she was at the festival the whole time, and all that texting about being at the hospital was complete bullcrap. He’s not even sure if her mom ever even had lupus and she was just hooking up with this guy for months. He immediately confronted her and her response was to just ghost him. Absolutely insane."
  EMS worker finds a teenager dead on a hotel roof after attempting dangerous stunts for internet fame. Tragic and avoidable.,"EMS workers, What's the most Avoidable Death you've ever seen?

Medic here. Responded to a call for a person that fell on the roof of a building. It was raining heavily that night. Details were ambiguous so we weren't quite sure what we were walking into. Showed up at the same time as fire and police department, so we all went to the roof of this hotel together, had to be about 60 stories. In the lobby is this teenager hyperventilating, saying ""he's dead"" over and over. Security can't figure out what's going on except that the kid had indicated he had come down the roof himself and his friend is still up there. We head on up, and ended up having to climb over machinery and through some narrow catwalks. We reach what I think were like these massive vents and there's the kid's friend. His neck was snapped and he was lying in a pool of blood. We just pronounced him dead right there. Laying next to him was a broken expensive camera. Turns out this guy and his buddy would sneak into skyscrapers and construction sites, climb to the highest points with no safety equipment, so they could grab photographs and post it on their blog. I'm sure you've seen those videos/gifs of young people doing the same thing with GoPros and stuff. So these kids snuck past security, climbed over a fence on the roof (security had to escort us to the roof because everything was locked by keypad), and climbed this vent thing to try to stand on the edge to grab pictures. Like I mentioned before, it was raining heavily and the ground up there was metal and slick. This kid was supposed to graduate high school in a couple months, and now he's dead because he was striving for internet fame by doing some dangerous shit. What broke my heart a bit was I was still on scene when the supervisors called the parents, who didn't even live in this city. As per the friend, they would sneak out to go pull these stunts. So I can't imagine being the mom or dad and answering that call at 2 AM, being notified that the child you thought was sleeping down the hall was lying dead in the rain on a hotel roof miles away. And all for what?"
"  teacher red flags: tardiness, disrespect, disorganization, ineffective teaching, unfair grading. Drop the class if these warning signs are present.","What are some red flags for teachers that scream ""drop this class immediately?""

Imagine You're in Logic 101 and this is your first day: You show up early as any good student will, shuffle in when a passing teaching Assistant unlocks the door 10 minutes after period start. You and your classmates settle in, assuming that the professor is having the same first day most students are and will just suddenly pop in, harried and apologetic. Ten minutes later, you're all actively discussing anything and everything when someone finally speaks up with the ""We can leave if the teacher doesn’t arrive, right?"" Some few initially agree but then the idea builds momentum:  this professor is wasting your time, your money, damnit! About fifteen minutes after that, the few of you who are left who probably share a Maths class are discussing diffy Q, integrals, derivatives, or even Euler's Constant when suddenly a quiet, unassuming, taller-than-average-and-older-than-God's-toenail-clippings man shuffles into the room wearing a burnt orange bubble vest overa button-down denim shirt, and otherwise horribly stained jeans;  those stains aren't urine or fecal, thank goodness, but why in all of creation would someone put on a pair of pants with so many greasy hand-swipes? Is that a ketchup stain on his calf? Before anyone can actually process this miracle, your professor speaks up (mostly), and after about four words you're not sure if he's actually talking to any of you: ""i just can't understand. no one shows up on time to classes anymore, it's ludicrous."" A Pause. He surveys you all, slowly, piercingly, with intent. Then he slams his textbook down onto the desk and shouts, ""LUDICROUS! DAMNED ENGRATES, EVERY ONE OF YOU!"" Mind you, this gentleman appears to be an incredibly animated and paunchy cadaver, so this shout is not terribly offensive by volume. Our cadavaerous logician has paced a few times after his outburst, and is now surveying the class once more when he speaks: ""Well, you'll be glad to know that everyone who has not arrived today, on time, will receive an F worth 10% of their grade. We have high expectations of our students with regards to attendance, and lolligagging will not be tolerated in this course."" He pauses, considering (who knows what), then continues, ""Now, this is your textbook, "" he raises the book he slammed down, and then promptly tosses it to his left into a garbage can before going on, ""you won't need it it is crap. You can't teach proper logic proofs with a textbook and that one is especially stupid."" You're finally realizing, after having bought your text book three weeks ago as is required by this particular institution upon registration for class and after having this professor show up 35 minutes into a 50 minute class, and after having that outburst that perhaps this is not a course you should take. This same professor went on to provide his class with one handout containing almost every symbol in formal logic but with no text or explanation of a given symbol's function, patently refused to answer any questions if he thought they were based on information to be found within the text, and generally mocked anyone who even spoke while alternatively berating us (few remaining) students for not asking enough questions. He provided no syllabus, assigned no work and simply showed up late everyday. Then he gave a midterm. This fine fellow actually had six sections of his course, and would you be surprised that only two students earned a passing grade? They dropped class after being bombarded with interrogation after Professor posted their names and scores in each section for everyone to see. Most of us dropped this course and went through the incredibly painful, unfriendly, bureacraticly insane process of tuition appeals and grade appeals, during which some of us learned our goof professor earned his tenure before most of our parents were born;  oh, and he was the head of the teacher's non-union union.

This is how an operator understood my creative way of asking for help.
When i was about 14, i had one of those slide phones. This was around 2008. My brother was having an angry fit and he broke a window. My dad, who was abusive, came into the kitchen and found the broken glass. He flipped. My dad was yelling and screaming, then he started beating my brother with his fists.
I called 911 and i was sobbing and he came over and slid my phone off, disconnecting the call. [edit: as i said in a comment, i don't think he knew it was the 911, he just turned his head and saw me on my phone crying]
I was terrified. There was my dad,now next to me, breathing heavily. It was so silent. I was terrified. He walks away to go bathroom. My brothers on the floor in front of me.
My cell phone vibrates. The police operator calls back. I know my dad wouldnt be long and i was right, he came back just as the lady on the phone asked if everything was ok, saying that there was a disconnect from this number.

I said it was 121 [street name] they were looking for, not my address, 122 [same street name]. The lady seemed confused for a moment, because there was a pause, then asked if i needed help. I said ""yes. It's just across the street from 121 [street]. Can't miss it. No problem alyssa. I'll see you at school tomorrow."" then hung up.

  person's regrets of their twenties include focusing too much on career/school and undervaluing the importance of socializing and building relationships.,"30 year olds, what's something you regret about your twenties?

Parties and friends are not a waste of time. They are integral to developing critical social skills that you will need to get ahead in life.
I'll echo ""focusing too much on career/school."" I have a very good career. BUT I could have achieved this career with a few more B's in college (and zero extracurriculars) and there would have been no difference. I wish I had spent more time socializing and dating. Not just for my life, but for my career as well.
Your personality/friendliness/collegial attitude is the #1 main thing that matters in getting most jobs. Unless you're applying to a top law firm or med school, the main determinant in whether you get a job is: a.) you have a degree (at my workplace, we don't even care about GPAs), and b.) people like you (based on interview and professional recs). They want to work with you. You seem like a nice, friendly colleague who knows how to share views politely, listen, complete work on time, work independently/confidently, and go out to lunch and have a pleasant conversation.
I spent far too long thinking that ""merit"" mattered: GPA, test scores, formal leadership positions in college and beyond, extracurriculars, volunteering, and in general appearing to try very hard. I remember feeling bitter when one ""slacker"" guy from my college got a great job right after we graduated and I didn't.
Now that I'm older, chilled out, and have been the person doing the hiring, I have learned that I had it all backwards and the slacker guy had it right. He got fairly decent but not perfect grades . Genial, friendly guy. If you worked with him on a project, he did his share (but no more than that). He was a fun, chill guy to hang out with at parties. No leadership roles, but if someone asked him to do something, he'd probably help with it."

I had a physics teacher who I really liked, but wasn't a really good teacher.

This was during the very early days of erasable boards being in schools, his was the only one in our whole district. And I got tired of writing down f’ing notes.
So one day, I peeped out the brand of marker he used. And when to the store and bought two boxes. And some permanent markers. Went home, pulled out the forceps, pully pully, stuffy stuffy, and viola: two boxes full of erasable marker bodies with permanent felts and ink. Now, to have a buddy distract the teacher before class starts, swap all the markers, and sit down and wait for the fireworks.
When he first went to erase the board, nothing happened. He kinda squinted at the board, pulled the eraser across it again. Again: nothing. (Useful to note: he hated the fumes from the markers, so he had a fan permanently aimed at the board and oscillating from the board to him, so by the time the notes had been up there 10 minutes or so, they were dry as the Gobi in a drought.) Now he knew what was up. Turned to the class, ""whelp, I guess that's all the notes for today. Nice prank, whoever you are! See you tomorrow."""

Then he asked the magic question: ""If I was to drop a flame into this container what would happen?""

"  high school overachiever seeks validation through fundraising competition, resorting to passive-aggressive social media tactics, resulting in unfriending.","What's the worst approval seeking behavior you've ever seen? 

There was this popular girl at my highschool who was misses perfect and would try to be the best in everything. She was the president of our Junior class and was the valedictorian at out graduation. She was honestly really annoying, the type to ask what grade you got on a test, say “oh that’s really good I only got a 95 I’m really dumb”. Anyways, our school had this fundraising event where whoever raised the most money for this charity got a ton of community service hours and got to speak at this event, of course miss perfect wanted to win really badly. So, she posted on her snapchat story a link to donate through her link and told everyone to share and donate. The caption for the post was ""I know 98% of you won't share this. Time to find out who my REAL friends are by sharing this. If you can't be bothered to share or donate you might as well just unadd me right now."" I then proceeded to unadd her."

Got caught banging my best friend's step sister in her car, in the driveway when I was 17. It was my grandmother that caught us. We were parked under a bright ass HPS light that was on the front of my grandad's shop, with the door open, like the stupid, horny teens we were. I'm going to town, and I hear a smack on the windshield. My grandma is standing there with a furious look on her face, and screams at the top her lungs ""Just what the hell are you doin'?!"" I look up with what I can only guess is a horrified and confused look on my face, with my neon white ass exposed, and say ""What the hell does it look like I'm doing?!"" I pull out, and sprint to the house, jump in my bed and pull the covers over my head. Needless to say, there was a very awkward breakfast the next morning. A few months later, I'm on my way out the door to take the same girl to Prom, and she hands me a few twenties wrapped around a strip of rubbers. She looks me in the eyes, smiles a big toothy grin, and says ""Now, don't spend it all in one place, son!"" My grandma is a f’ing legend"
"  mother debates whether they are wrong for insisting their son be invited to their daughter's wedding after his misconduct.




","AITA for insisting my son be invited to my daughters wedding after he got drunk, groped her friends against their will and had to be tossed out of her engagement celebration?

Am I the ayy hole for insisting my son be invited to my daughters wedding after he got drunk, groped her friends against their will and had to be tossed out of her engagement celebration. So I am in a bit of a dilemma, my daughter is getting married this summer and my son was not invited. They have never really got along and recently they had a big disagreement. My daughter had an engagement party and my son got a bit drunk and got handsy with some of my daughter's friends which they didn't like, and my daughter was furious at him for touching her friends. She kicked him out and I only found this out after the party was over. Flash forward to now my son got a message from my daughter uninviting him to her wedding because of his behavior toward her friends. He was so upset and called me to tell me what she had said and to be honest I think it's a shame that she feels so angry about it but I rang my daughter up and told her i will not be attending the wedding if my son can't come. I felt as though  what he did wasn't worthy of ruining family relationships as him not being invited to her wedding is a huge deal. He has always been a bit temperamental and he gets carried away with things but he means well. I also think it is slightly hypocritical of her as I recently became aware that she was a bit of a homewrecker when she was in her late teens and early twenties.  My daughter called me and shouted at me saying that I was enabling his horrible behavior and even my fiance's mother called me to express her frustration with my decision. That said, I really don't think I'm in the wrong here. If the friends don't feel comfortable shouldn't they be uninvited instead of her own brother? Instead, myself and my son are going to Las Vegas for the weekend of the wedding, which will be more enjoyable anyway due to the fact that the Raiders are playing the Chiefs. So am I the ayy hole for insisting that my son be invited to my daughter’s wedding?"
"  mother-in-law falsely accuses couple of baby abuse during tummy time, but police find no evidence and support the couple.","Mother in-law called the police due to tummy time…

Mother in-law called the police due to tummy time… I really can’t believe it, but my Mother in law claims my partner and I are abusing our baby since he “complains” while on his tummy (our doctor said he needs more tummy time for his flat spot, to strengthen his muscles, as well as to help him roll over). He doesn’t like tummy time but it’s not like he even gets to the point of crying. He just makes uncomfortable noises. We tried explaining this to Mother in law but she keeps claiming we are forcing the baby and abusing him. Mother in law has been living with us the last few months and things have gone great until this happened. Two days ago she snatched the baby from me during tummy time and said I am committing violence against him. I regretted letting her take him but let her. Then yesterday she tried the same thing and I refused to give her my baby. The thing is, I WASN’T EVEN DOING TUMMY TIME. My baby complains when he isn’t doing something, he just constantly gets bored. Mother in law heard him complaining from another room and came barging in saying I’m abusing him again. I walked away from her and locked the door behind me. She pounded on the door saying she will call the cops and she did. I called my partner who left work immediately and drove home. Two policemen talked to her and then us. I invited them in and said they could walk around. They looked around and saw an immaculately clean place and a very happy baby (Mother in law had not been cleaning up the past couple days or helping with anything like she did in the past making me think this was premeditated to try and make us look bad, but I had been cleaning behind her). Mother in law tried telling the cops that we were dirty because the dirty bottles and snot sucker were in the same place, that we pet the dog then hold the baby, and that we do tummy time where the cat lays on the couch. When she told them that tummy time hurts the baby they just said “I’m not a professional doctor.” The police couldn’t contain their laughter saying it sounds like Mother in law thinks she is the “resident expert” and that they run into mothers who disagree with parenting styles a lot. I unfortunately couldn’t laugh along because I was in tears explaining the situation but it was obvious the police were on our side. The police told us the clean house does not look like an unsafe environment for the baby. They also informed us that at this point they were just there for a venting session with Mother in law and not to worry. Of course no police report was filed. My partner had my back the whole time and kicked Mother in law out of our house. She had a couple hours to pack her bags and then I drove her to a motel. She of course was mad but had no remorse and thinks she did nothing wrong. She doesn’t have much money so my partner and I are paying for it. We got her a flight home tomorrow. I’m not sure what will happen in the future but it might be the last time Mother in law sees her grandchild… Mother in law has no idea and thinks it’s her baby too. Luckily Mother in law and father in law live on the other side of the country. Here’s to hoping they never move here…"
"  wife demands husband to choose between her and his mother, leading him to consider divorce due to her ultimatum.","My wife asked me to choose between my mom and her and I think I am going to divorce her

My wife asked me to choose between my mom and her and I think I am going to divorce her. My mum and dad were both orphans, my dad died two weeks before I was born, my mum didn't really have a support system, so we were just the two of us. I never lacked anything because my mother worked all her life to give me the life I have today and didn't even have time for herself to start a new life again. She did all the little jobs possible so that we didn't miss anything. She deprived herself of food to give me food, I had very good clothes while she had none. I saw her make sacrifices again and again and always with a smile, frankly I always thought she was an angel dressed in a human body. The only time she yelled at me was when I was 16 when I saw her getting sick and working at the same time. I wanted to help her by finding a job, but she was angry and told me it was not my job to take care of her and it was up to her to take care of me, she wanted me to get really good grades to get into the best universities it's the only way I can protect myself when she can't anymore. Even at university she didn't want me to work, I had to be focused on my studies, but she wanted me to volunteer ""so that I could be an adult who could do something with his hands"". I met my wife there while both of us were volunteering. My wife is a good person, but she was never close to her parents or her siblings. Yet she adored my mother since she met her, there were times when I thought she loved my mother more than she loved me and we laughed about it, deep down, I think she was looking for the bond between mother and daughter that she did not have from her mother. When I finished my studies, I found a job, we move in together, but she wasn't comfortable that I call my mom everyday (remind you those were 15 minute calls) but eventually she stopped bringing it up. Two years later I bought a house for my mother, because we never had a house in our name, we lived from apartment to apartment, so for all the sacrifices she made it was for me the least of it and it was non-negotiable, that's where the problems started with my wife. She wanted me to think about us first, I told her my dream had always been to buy my mom a house since I was little and that's what I had to do. But she complained about It to my mom. My mom didn't even know I bought a house for her as It was suppose to be a surprise for her birthday. She was uncomfortable receiving the house because of my wife and told me that wasn't necessary that we could use It for us when we get married. I was furious. I told my mother that the house was for her, that she could do with it whatever she wanted but it was time for her to think about herself first. Our relationship survived that, we got married and then we had our own house. Our life was going well until two months ago when my mother fell ill, I wanted her to come and live with us so that I could take care of her, but my wife didn't want to, I then decided to rent an apartment with my own money right next to our house so that I could be close to her and go there to take care of her. But even that idea didn't sit well with my wife. Me and my wife don't have children yet, we both work. I usually come home at 6pm, but since my mother is sick, I go to see her and come home at 8pm. On weekends I see her for 1 or 2 hours and the rest of the time I spend It with my wife. We go on dates, I always accompany her in her hobbies even though she never went to mine. Two days ago she told me that she thought about it and she thinks I prioritize my mother too much. She told me that I had to choose between my mother and the life I want to build with her.The truth is that I never made her feel that way. We both work but I'm the one who cooks, and I pay a person to do the housework. I make sure I do the dishes she likes, she didn't even know what I like to eat because I never complain. I run her baths, give her massages, flowers, I write her poems that I hide somewhere in the house for her to find out, we go on a trip one weekend a month, I earn much more money than her, I told her to keep her money for herself and I take care of all the bills even hers, I always make sure to listen to her and consider her opinion, and I think I am easy going because I can change my mind to accommodate hers, but I realize that she tries to completely dominate me and the only subject where I don't give her a choice is my relationship with my mother. So there I'm going to have a talk with her and put some very clear boundaries. If she doesn't want to, well, we're going to divorce. Just want It out of my chest"
  person shares dumbest way they had intimate relations with a coworker-friend who was initially thought to be a lesbian.,"What’s the dumbest way you’ve managed to get laid?

What’s the dumbest way you’ve managed to get laid? I was 18 and she was 24. So I met this chick working at a warehouse, she was the only girl around my age and all the guys wanted to hit on her. But she had the I'm here just for work attitude, so I didn’t bother even being friendly so she didn’t think I was like the other guys. Long story short we ended up becoming friends, we would have break together and walk to our cars together. Still treating her like a normal coworker. Come to find out later on she was lesbian. She ended up quitting a few months after working there and so did I since it was a poor job. A few months go by and she finds me on instagram. She DM’s me and tells me she wants to hang, I agree and we meet up for breakfast. She proceeds to tell me she’s joining the navy, told her I was happy for her and wish her the best, she tells me she doesn’t have many friends here in the city and that she was hoping I hung out with her before going to boot camp. I said sure! Coolest chick and well it was a good time, talking to her more found out she wasn’t fully lesbian she just stopped being with guys years ago. I was in shock since she didn’t give any other guys the time of the day, but didn’t think much of it. In my book she was into girls only so no hints were picked up by my dumb brain. We spent the last few days hanging out hiking and having fun. About her last 3 days in the city we meet up to eat and do errands she still had to do. I went with her because I didn’t have anything else to do. We ended up having a few drinks. She asked me if I could take her to a place, we had gone to see the scenery of the city. But as we were leaving the apartments she was insisting we go swimming, I didn’t have extra clothes but soaking my feet would be nice. When we get to the pool area, she starts taking off her clothes. Not once did I check her out since she dressed like a tomboy. But she had a volleyball player figure. We talked a little and then headed back to the apartment because she wanted to shower. Now she was acting strange going back and forth before getting in the shower. She went in with the door open but I didn’t turn around, in my head I didn’t want her to think I was hanging with her to get in her pants. I truly liked her company as friends and the stories she would tell me. So I was trying to make her feel comfortable and not worry that I would pull anything. She gets out the shower dressed and we continue drinking the drinks we left. I still had my 2nd beer to finish and she still had her 4th. She gets up to get her next beer and opens the fridge door with a straight question. “So you want to sleep with me or what?” my mind went blank and had about 2 seconds to respond. 1 second to try and make sure I heard her right and the other second to come up with an answer. I started stuttering and my brain came to the conclusion that she thought I was there to sleep with her and she wasn’t. So I said “No, I’m just enjoying your company”. After a few seconds I asked her what she said since I still didn’t know if I heard her right. She then jokingly said “well if you want to waste a few minutes of your life with me then yes” she then gets up like if you overslept and had to head to work, but we were heading to her bed. She grabs my hand like girls did to us guys as kids to take us somewhere. Well the rest is obvious, the whole time I was in shock that it was happening."
"  loved one's chilling words: ""He looks like your daughters."" Tragic accident, premonition of twins' loss. Profound grief, everlasting love.","What was the most bone-chilling sentence a loved one ever said to you?

What was the most bone-chilling sentence a loved one ever said to you? “He looks like your daughters.” My twin brother was in a car accident on our 24th birthday. He had flown in from our home country and had rented a car and was on his way to see me and meet my husband for the first time. (We had eloped because we were both so far from family and couldn't afford travel). I was contacted by the hospital and my husband and I drove there as fast as we could. My brother was in very bad shape and the doctors were grim. We were allowed to see him and I knew right away this would be the last time we would see each other. I think he did, too. He was very drowsy and going in and out of sleep/consciousness, but at one point, he was very lucid and asked me who the man was with me. I told him that's my husband and I introduced them to each other. My brother looked at me hard and said, “he looks like your daughters.” He squeezed my hands and repeated that twice more. My husband and I were shocked. We had just found out I was pregnant. I had told no one. After that, my brother was mostly unconscious. I did try to tell him I was pregnant, but I don't know if he ever heard me. I like to think he did. He died early the next morning. I lost my best friend in the world that day. I lost the other half of me that day. If you are a twin or know twins, then you know what I mean. Sadly, 3 months later I was back at the same hospital to have an ultrasound. It told us two things. One, that our twins had passed away, and second, that they were girls. I have never cried harder. How he knew… I will never know. I believe they are with their uncle now, and I will see them all one day again. Until then, there isn't a day that goes by that I don't think of them and love them. I did go on to have a son later. I am so sorry he never got to know my brother. They are so alike. It's beautiful."

What is the most amazing thing you overheard because people didn't think you understood their language? A friend and I were backpacking through Europe in 1990 and were in Paris on Bastille Day. We were sitting on the crowd barriers and watching the laser light show by the Arc de Triumph when a group of 6 or 7 Iranian guys passed by. They were talking non-stop and walked by us multiple times always speaking about us. It just so happened that my mother was from Iran and I was fairly fluent in Farsi, so I told my friend that I would handle it if they came over. They were being very explicit about what they could get me and/or my friend to do with them sexually that night. After the 3rd pass they stopped in front of us and the “leader” asked in French if I spoke French, I told him no, and he asked in 2 other languages if we spoke those languages, each time I said no. He turned to his friends in Farsi and said “I asked if she spoke French, German, and Italian what else could it be”. I then responded in Farsi “Why don’t you ask me if I speak Farsi?”. All but the leader scattered into the night like cockroaches when the light comes on. The leader went down on one knee addressing me formally as a lady begging my forgiveness, to which I replied in Farsi “I’m now a lady, what has changed? Two minutes ago I was a whore”. I didn’t know if I’d be able to get my friend back to the hostel that night, she was laughing so hard. She looked at me and said “I don’t know what you said, but that was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen”."

As a doctor or nurse, what is one disease or situation you never want to see again? A youngish woman, maybe in her 30’s was admitted to our ICU. She was scheduled for immediate brain surgery.. Our intensivist (also our medical director) was her admitting Doc. He explained her situation thus: She had diabetes that was very poorly controlled, if at all. People whose diabetes isn't well controlled often suffer from fungal infection, mostly benign types, like oral yeast and similar types of things. The excess sugars on the body provide food for fungus. But why the emergency brain surgery for this woman? Well the Doc had examined her in the ER and he explained it to us. His words were so chilling I'm sure I'll never forget them. He said: “The minute I saw black tears coming from her eyes,I knew what she had,and I knew it wasn't going to be good.” He went on to explain about the black tears. He sent her immediately for a CT of her brain and called a neurosurgeon. He further explained to us nurses, "" There's a very rare type of invasive fungal infection found almost exclusively in patients with poor diabetes control. Usually it's seen first on the hard palate of the mouth. It cannot be scraped off however. This type of fungus, even when it's very small in appearance,sends out hyphae (you can imagine them as a type of roots) deep into the tissues they are near. And since it appears on the hard palate, the tissues right above it are the sinuses,tear ducts,eyes and brain. I'm afraid that, because it's rarely found quickly, and because she has black tears,it's probably already in her brain. It's called Mucormycosis.” She did not return from surgery. The hyphae had penetrated very deeply into her brain,too deeply for her to survive. Our Doc was not surprised,but all we nurses were inordinately shocked. I never saw another case of this in my career and never want to again. Gives me the shudders."

 I am a 17 year old girl, I live with my mom and dad and my home life is terrible. My dad is abusive in all the ways you can think of and have all the traits of a narcissist, I hate him so much. My mom on the other hand, I love her but she’s weak and has no backbone. I asked her once why she never left him and begged her to leave him, but she said that she wanted her kids to grow up in a two parent household because her parents divorced when she was a kid and she hated them for it and her relationship with them is now rocky. But my Nana and Papa are the best of friends and are happy in their own marriages. I just wished she took a page out of their book.My relationship with my dad is terrible, I never speak to him unless necessary. He took my door off my room a long time ago because I locked it when I was getting dressed, my mom convinced him to give it back but he got a key so I don’t even see the point of having a door cause he still can barge in. He expects me, my mom, and my siblings to treat him like he’s god, and more stuff that I don’t want to include.  a couple of months ago my mom asked me and my siblings what we wanted to do after graduation. Since my birthday is a week after graduation I decided to do this program that one of the donors from the college I am attending has sponsored. They were sponsoring five students to study abroad in a country of their choice for five months completely funded by them, then afterwards I’m starting college that is states away from home. After that my dad started acting weird towards me like his behavior and what not. He would start complimenting me more, commenting on my body or my clothes, the way he would stare at me like he was touching me with his eyes, touch me more often, and would lash out on me whenever I even brought up a boy. I told my mom and brother about it but they all thought that it was just in my head. Graduation is literally in two days and I honestly don’t feel safe. The night of graduation I’m gonna stay at a friend's house, I already have clothes over there that would last me a while. I’m honestly just hoping my dad won’t call the cops and force me home since I’m not of age yet."
"  lottery winner lives a quiet life, pretends to be a janitor, and enjoys working on cars in his garage.","I tell people I'm a janitor.

I tell people I'm a janitor. I'll try and keep this as short as I can, but it might ramble on. So buckle up. I grew up a pretty introverted person. I would open up to people close to me, but was insanely quiet in most public settings. I'm a fairly attractive dude, just awkward as poop. And I never hated it. I enjoy my peace and quiet. I always left school the second the bell rang and went home as fast as possible. I did the same at work for years. I frequent bars when my favorite sports teams have big games to at least get some public interaction, otherwise, I'm a homebody. Anyway, After high school I moved to a city 30 mins away from my hometown. I found work, a place to live, and had a vehicle to get to and from. This was in 2005. I've made my way up in the company and made ~150k a year salary as of 2021. Then things changed. In October 2021, I won the lottery. It wasn't one of the record-setting billion dollar wins, but it was a decent amount. I took home just under 100 mill. It was also in a state that legally requires disclosure from the winner, so I won't tell you what state it was. For this very reason, I suddenly had old friends hitting me up for the first time in over a decade on facebook, instagram, etc. I deleted all social media, and no one knew where I lived since I had moved away so long ago, and moved multiple times since. I hired a financial advisor, and continued my life as normal for about 3 months. Once I had my ducks in a row, I put in my 2 weeks, and prepared to move into a modest home in the town I had lived in for the last 17 years. And then I started living my dream of just working on cars in my garage that is bigger than my house. My appearance started to change a little bit, as I didn't need to keep up my work appearance anymore. I started going out to bars a little more often for almost every local baseball, basketball, or football game that was on. And I started getting attention from people. Women in particular. Every now and then, a conversation would actually carry on past a couple minutes, or even over multiple visits. When it came down to them asking what I did for work, I would always say ""I work in the custodial arts."" It's a line from Half Baked. Eventually it would come to me saying ""I'm a janitor."" They're facial expressions would always immediately drop. I'd go on to describe how much I love it, I live by myself, no family, no kids. I wouldn't trade it for the world. It's funny how people turn to immediately judge the guy buying rounds and enjoying his day when he says he's a janitor. And only reinforces my love for living a quiet, lowkey lifestyle. I have taken a couple ladies home over the past year, and when we get to my house they always ask again, ""So, you're a janitor??"" I don't really know why I felt like typing this out this morning, maybe I smoked a little more than usual with my coffee. I mean, I'm not technically lying, as I do spend more time cleaning my garage than I do actually using it. Either way, happy Friday."

I resent my parents' autism. 
One of my parents has a formal autism diagnosis and the other one would be a shoe in if they ever got assessed. I'm not autistic- I just don't fit the criteria at all. I feel like I can't blame them for their symptoms, but it really impacted me growing up, for a lot of reasons. Neither of them can read facial expressions or emotions very well, so they generally couldn't tell if I was upset until I was crying. Both responded to me breaking down with confusion, then anger- my dad because he couldn't imagine I had a justifiable reason to be upset (ever. Literally ever. He doesn't perceive other people's emotions.) and my mum because she couldn't be intuit enough to help. They both have very specific routines and objects that HAVE to be used, and will have meltdowns if they can't have them. My mum has literally thrown screaming tantrums because I accidentally used her favorite coffee cup. It was very, very scary to deal with as a kid. I feel awful saying it, but I really don't think they were equipped to parent me. I know for a fact that they love me, but it sure as poop doesn't feel like that when someone can see you crying and say to your face that crying means nothing to them, so you'll have to explain. They also hated to hear me talking- I was a loud, excitable, attention-hungry kid, and both of them had sensory issues that made being around me miserable. Usually when people are emotionally neglected they can find solace in the neglect being irrational, but I was LITERALLY unpleasant for my parents to be around. horrible things to my self esteem and mental health.Am I a bad person for feeling like this? This seems to be a rare situation so I'm not sure where to even start fixing it."

Brother In Law  had just turned 10 - I’m 25. I’m marrying his half-sister in a few weeks. I won’t get into too much detail on the backstory because honestly, there’s a lot. Short version: His parents almost never spend time with him. When they do, they swear at him for making basically any level of mistake, but won’t tell him what he did or why it was wrong. To them “spending time together” is being in the same room, but not talking. He doesn’t know how to brush his hair by himself…it’s down to his butt. He has the social skills of a much younger child. His parents don’t usually cook for him except for rare occasions, and I’ve seen him have “dinner” or just slices of deli ham straight out of the fridge at 10:00pm.  My Father In Law also bragged about giving his depressed stepchild an eating disorder and laughed. Like, genuinely laughed about it. I always tried to be there for him. I was also neglected by my family, and I wanted him to know that at least one person was going to care about him on purpose. I taught him how to knit. We did it together often until my fiancé got upset that it was cutting into our time with each other. Fast forward to the past year or so - my fiancé and I moved out of their house and into an apartment. This past Thanksgiving, I was helping lead the charge on cleaning up dinner and dishes. My fiancé’s parents hosted. While I was helping him figure out which leftovers to put in what kind of tupperwares, he asked if he could come over and visit our apartment. We’d gotten a second cat and he wanted to meet her. Naturally I said of course, as long as it was okay with his parents. He starts RUNNING out of the room - I caught him, luckily. I clarified if he meant right then, like that night, which he confirmed. He then added: “And then maybe I could stay there, you could be my new mom.” I forget what happened next to be honest. I gave him a vague non answer of like…oh, we’ll have you over soon buddy, that type of thing. And y’all? I made an excuse to go into the garage and just. Absolutely bawled my  eyes out. I know there’s a chance he meant like…female figure you live with, mom. Like in a neurodivergent way (because same). But like, goddamn, even that’s depressing. I don’t know if it was even that deep but it’s been months and I’m still not over it. Maybe I’m just projecting my own childhood onto the situation. Just felt like I needed to talk about it.

"  woman ended the relationship after her boyfriend yelled at her and called her derogatory names, asserting her self-worth and boundaries.","I broke up with my boyfriend because he yelled at me.

I'm a 29 year old woman.
He and I dated for about eight months. Our relationship was fine. We did things together, we had fun. There weren't any obvious red flags, but I always got this feeling that he didn't value me much. At times he seemed a bit cold and acted like he was annoyed with me for no apparent reason.  
It all came to a head when, three days ago when we were hanging out at my place, he asked me to hand him the TV remote. I was sitting right next to him on the couch and was working on my laptop. I reached for the remote without looking and accidentally handed him my phone instead.  
I thought it was funny after I realized what I had done. I laughed as I handed him the actual remote. He had that same annoyed look on his face. He began yelling at me and called me ""a stupid female dog"". 
I was stunned. I have NEVER raised my voice at him, or disrespected him in any way. I did not deserve to be treated this way. I told him our relationship was over and asked him to leave. He told me to calm down and stop overreacting. 
I simply walked to the front door opened it wide and told him to get out, and never come back. He walked out telling me I was being dramatic. 
The very next day I returned the presents he had given me. They meant nothing to me now.
My friends are telling me that I DID overreact and I shouldn't just end a relationship because he yelled at me once,  and has asked me to patch things up. His friends too began bugging me on social media.  I blocked them all (HIS friends, not mine). 
I'm not going to reach out to him to try to ""work things out"" as some people have suggested. Because I know that I do not deserve this treatment. I've always treated him with respect and I deserve that in return. 
I just needed to tell somebody. Thank you for reading."
"  former sex worker recalls role-playing as a client's pet dog, finding it strangely comforting and financially rewarding.","x workers of Reddit, what’s the weirdest kink a customer has asked you to fulfill?

I was 19 when all this went down. I was a ""high end"" hooker from 17-20 yrs old. Me and a bunch of other girls i worked with, (some underage) had a pimp. He was a gay black man named Mischa and he passed himself off as a photographer. That's how I got wrapped in it all. He was very popular and had lots of money. He even had an art gallery in a very distinguished district in my area. A Lot of people didn't know it but a lot of the models in his art were underage. He treated us like family at first. Like he was our protector. Anything we needed we came to him. And the girls became my best friends, we partied together, shopped together, emotionally supported each other when one of us would have a rough night with a bad client... he kept us on a steady diet of cocaine and money. You know, so we'd keep coming back for more and be loyal to him. Eventually the clouds rolled away and i saw him for what he was. We were his employees not friends, and he didn't care about our safety. So I ran away.
Anyways, during my run, my girls and I would be brought to these mansions filled with rich older men, most married, some famous or very well known for their success. I was too drugged up and blind sided to care who was who. That and I have a facial recognition issue so I don't bother learning who's who, but I would randomly hear ""oh he's a politician"" or ""he's a football player"" from one of the girls so that's how i knew.
I had one client, late 60s. We called him Hatman. To this day I'm still not sure why we called him that. I always assumed he had made his big money owning a hat company. Who knows, I wasn't very smart back then. So Hatman had a very special interest. He would pay me to pretend i was his pet dog. I'd come over and he had a cage, a food and water bowl, my collar, leash. I wasn't allowed to speak. And i was usually naked. It would start with me laying at the foot of his bed or couch or on the floor...the more i immersed myself in the role the more money he'd give me. And a lot of times it didn't even end in sex. I mean he'd fondle me (what he called petting) but usually it was just me pretending to be his pet all night while he watched Sopranos until we fell asleep. I'm not gonna lie. Compared to what other clients had me do, this was the easiest and kinda nicest work i had to do. He was nice to me. He pretended i was his adored pet. Compared to my upbringing, it was nice feeling cared for. In the morning I'd wake up still in my collar, in his bed, with a big wad of cash on the bedside table and he'd be gone, off to do whatever millionaire businessman do all day."
"  a man discovers his girlfriend has been secretly taking contraceptive pills despite their plans to have a baby, causing trust issues.","My Girlfriend and I Have Been Trying for a Baby. She's Been Taking Contraception Behind my Back.

My Girlfriend and I Have Been Trying for a Baby. She's Been Taking Contraception Behind my Back. i’ve been with Katie for almost 2 years now, she’s everything i could possibly want in a girlfriend, i was planning on proposing later this summer to her, but now im just not sure. I made it very clear from the start of our relationship i want at least one child and she told me she did too when she was a bit older, she’d like to be at least 25 when she has a child, and I agreed and said there was no rush for it, it’s just becoming a father is something i definitely want to do. She also told me early in the relationship she’s been on the contraceptive pill since she was 15 for hormonal acne. I told her that was fine and she could just come off the pill when she was ready and then we could potentially start having a baby together. Earlier this year, end of december 2021, I bought up again that I'd like a child at some point and Katie actually said she’d been thinking for a while of coming off of her birth control and trying for a baby with me. I was over the moon and so incredibly happy and so we decided to finally start trying properly. The first month in January, she got her period and i was a little disappointed but also know these things don’t happen straight away, i have to be patient. But every month that’s since gone by and she’s had a period, i’ve felt more and more disappointed each time. We’ve tried everything including tracking her cycle and having intimacy around her ovulation date, but it didn’t seem to work. I’ve tried to keep my spirits up and support Katie as she’s also been kind of down about the whole thing, but I’ve kept reminding her it’s only been 5 months now and i'm sure she’ll fall pregnant within a year or so. She’s had a couple of late periods and each time i’ve asked her to do a pregnancy test and we’ve gotten the single line, it’s crushed me a little bit inside. This brings me to today, Katie had woke up and once again had her period. I felt that pain in my chest but put a sympathetic smile on for her and told her when it happens it happens so don’t blame yourself. I went into the bathroom to get her some painkillers only to realize we didn’t have any. I assumed she might have some in her purse which was in the front room on the table. I opened her purse and picked up a little packet of pills, only these weren’t pain medicine. They were contraceptive pills. My heart sank as the box was empty, yet in her purse she had another box which was full. I took them to her and asked why she had these still if she hadn’t been taking the pill for almost 6 months now. She started to panic and tried to grab the boxes from me saying she’s so sorry and she can explain everything, but when i gave her a chance to do so, she couldn’t at all. All she said was she wasn’t ready for a baby yet and when I asked her why she couldn’t just tell me that rather than have us both go through the pain every month she didn’t conceive, she didn’t have a reason. I told her it was fine she had changed her mind and wasn’t ready, but she should of told me. I said i couldn’t trust her anymore as she’s gone behind my back to hide something pretty big from me and she got upset and said she’s going to visit her mom for the day. I let her go but since i’ve been home by myself thinking about this, i’ve realized how badly it’s messed me up. I always made sure she could tell me anything, i've never put pressure on her or shouted at her or done anything to make her feel otherwise. I just don’t understand how she could of been taking these pills behind my back without telling me, while faking the disappointment i’ve felt every month when she’s got her period. I don’t know where to go from here. as far as i’m concerned, i'm not going to propose in 3 months time anymore. it’s going to take a lot to build my trust back, and i don’t know if she can. not having a child is a deal breaker for me, it’s just shitty as i love this woman with my whole heart. i'm so hurt by this."
"  a person discovers divorce papers hidden in their air vent, leaving them devastated and questioning their husband's feelings and intentions.","I found DIVORCE PAPERS in my AIR VENT.

I found DIVORCE PAPERS in my AIR VENT. I (29) and my husband (30) have been married for 4 years now, together for 7. And it's going fantastically well. He's handsome, cute, kind, loving, and makes me feel safe and wanted and loved and protected. He takes me on dates, shows physical affection wherever he can, and also just makes me feel happy. We have no kids but we are trying for it. So the other day I was cleaning the house (I'm a housewife) and I was cleaning the air vent at the top of the staircase aisle, because we had never cleaned it ever since we bought the house. And when I opened it, there was a box. An unmarked box. I took it out and then opened it and then there was a note (more about it somewhere down below) and... Divorce papers. All ready with our names on it. The only thing wasn't filled in was the signatures of us. I was crushed. He had just gone to work after kissing me for 7-8 minutes and hugged me and everything had been going great. So why this? I opened the note, and it read as follows: It is with immense regret and sadness that your love between you and (my name) has run its course. I'm sorry (his name). You didn't deserve this. Or you did. I don't know. Maybe she cheated, maybe you did. Maybe the love didn't last for you. All those times, all those moments of being with her, are of no use now. In the end, she did go away. Or you rather made her leave. She's gone. Never coming back. It's okay you EFFING r word pos, you didn't deserve her in the first place. Dumb and stupid and delusional is what you are since you didn't push her away in the first place. You don't deserve love. You deserve to be shot. Or She cheated on you. I'm sorry for that. She let another man's dick inside her and she didn't back off. She had an affair, physical or emotional, and she didn't choose you. Forget her. Forgive her. Because to be amity, is to be forgiving. And you deserve the peace my friend. You did everything that you could, but she wanted more. Listen to ""We Don't Understand Each Other"" from ST3, and go to sleep. Hit the gym tomorrow. I'm here for you. Take care mate. Yours, (His Name). His note was from himself. I'm crying right now. I've never cheated on him and never even had the thought of cheating on him. All I want is him to be with me. What should I do? It breaks me to see how he thinks like this"
"  high school student evades police during a skipping incident, unknowingly witnessing a stabbing scandal involving classmates.","What was the BIGGEST SCANDAL at your high school?

What was the BIGGEST SCANDAL at your high school? I was a habitual skipper in high school. One day, I didn’t feel like going to calculus so I slept in the back seat of my car. I dozed off, and faintly remember hearing the bells go off for class-release. I wake up extremely groggy, and the windows are foggy from me being inside sleeping with the car turned off. I look at my phone and start browsing Facebook, when I hear someone talking behind the car… I immediately think “&$@!, I’m busted. Someone saw me and is coming to check the car and they’ll know I’m skipping”. I unlock the rear folding seats, and shimmy into my trunk and pull the seat back up.. but just enough so that it won’t lock me in. Whoever was around passed right by my car, and I was not a big fan of getting caught.. so I stayed silent looking through the crack of the backseat. After a few minutes, I climb back into the seat area, and try to peek out the window. 5 police cars flashing blue and red all around me. Cops scurrying around, walking up and down the aisles of vehicles. My mind is going a million miles an hour. “Why the hell did they send the police after me??? I only skipped one class period, this seems like overkill”. I had already been arrested once, and was not keen on being in jail a second time. So I figure that they have no idea where I am, and that they might not be there for me. I open the door, and drop to the ground. Crawl on my hands and knees past a couple vehicles and underneath a big Silverado that was parked a few spaces away. After I hear the late bell ring, I stand up on the opposite side of the Silverado, and start walking briskly towards my next class. An officer sees me and starts yelling, “what are you doing here? What’s your name? Do you have any I.D on you?” “What? My name is Bryce, here’s my I.D - I’m really late for class and going across the parking lot is a shortcut, I’m sorry! I didn’t know I wasn’t supposed to do that”, I reply. He looks at my I.D, then looks at me, and says “alright, get out of here.” I dart under the caution tape that was around the area, and make my way to class. The second I get in, I pretend nothing is wrong and just get to work as usual. By 7th period my classmates asked, “did you hear what happened during 2nd period?” During the same period that I slept, a boy and girl from my school also skipped class. They got into an argument because he thought she was cheating, and he stabbed her in the neck with a pencil. He then stabbed himself in the wrists, and tried to run from the school. She called 911, and the police arrived to look for him, w/ an ambulance. They were two cars down from me. That was the biggest “scandal” of our high school. He went to prison for attempted murder, and she ended up okay, somehow he missed all major arteries."
"  unjust traffic ticket experience from the 1970s with an officer falsely claiming the exact speed, leading to an unfair conviction.","What’s the BIGGEST SHOCK you’ve ever SEEN?

What’s the BIGGEST SHOCK you’ve ever SEEN? I received my driver’s license in 1971. At that time, I had long hair, which was decidedly not popular with the police. I was stopped continually and given tickets for things I had not done. When I bought my first car (a 10 year old Chevy), my father put a governor on the gas pedal to keep the car from going over 50 mph (the speed limit on the rural roads where I grew up). One day a cop stopped me and gave me a ticket, claiming that I was driving 57 mph. When we got to the court, the cop testified that he was parked at a convenience store when he saw me drive by. The cop asserted that he could tell I was driving exactly 57 mph. No radar, no pacing my vehicle. Just his claim that he could tell exactly how fast I was going based on looking at my car drive by. I then explained to the judge that my car’s gas pedal had a governor on it, and the car was incapable of going more than 50 mph. I told the judge the car was parked outside, and he was welcome to see it and verify that what I was saying was true. Instead, he found me guilty of speeding, and told me he could sentence me to seven years in prison for perjury, since I lied about the speed I was driving, but he would not pursue the perjury charge, as I was only 17 years old, and hopefully had learned my lesson not to lie in court.

  woman faces familial backlash after refusing to give her brother her newly purchased house despite their mother's misguided support.,"AITA for not giving in to my brother's tantrums?

AITA for not giving in to my brother's tantrums? I [F29] recently bought a house and a brand new car. I will admit I probably splurge on my house more than I should but growing up very poor, it has always been a dream of mine to live in a nice house. I worked really hard to be where I am. So much so I undergo countless breakups because I always choose a career over boys. My brother [M,25] is currently jobless. He works as a tourist guide before and can barely make ends meet. He has five kids now (and counting as his wife announced pregnancy recently). He messaged me on FB that there is something he wants to talk about and I thought he wants to name me godmother to his incoming baby. I said sure and invited him to the house to get his approval about some things I modified for our parents. I gave him a tour and he admired my house greatly, saying things like how excited he is to bring the kids to my house. I did not mind anything about it as I thought he meant a visit, which I'm more than happy to host them for. Imagine my surprise when he finally sat me down and finally revealed what he wanted to talk about. HE.WANTS.ME.TO.GIVE.HIM.MY.HOUSE. I clarified whether he meant this house or the other house I bought for my parents which I still lived in (still has modifications ongoing with my dream house). He said the house is big enough for his family and I can go visit them anytime I like. He even offered that if I really wanted to live there, I can go move into the maid's room and modify it for my personal use. I was shocked I cannot speak as he thanked me over and over for the house. I finally asked him where the heck did that idea come from and said our mother told him I will give him MY HOUSE. I of course corrected that and this is where things went south. My brother repeatedly said since our mom said the house is his now, I cannot do anything but give in. I called my mother to tell him to duck off and lo and behold, my mother sided with my brother. To make this already long story short, my whole family had cut me off and my parents disowned me until I gave my brother my house. My father has been brought to the hospital over this fight and now I feel really bad. The guy I'm seeing now said to just give the house to my brother and he'll help me to buy another.

I’m 40 and in love with a 25 year old ESCORT. I'm (40 M) in Love with an escort (25 F) 8 years ago my wife passed away and I had a difficult time coping. Eventually I tried online dating, but went nowhere. I started seeing an escort, and she was amazing. We really connected on an emotional as well as a physical level. I've seen her at least once a week for the past 5 years. I feel like we've grown close over this time and she's opened up to me as well. She's told me her real name l, I've been to her actual condo, she's told me her reasons for becoming an escort. We talk about her family... and I've even taken her on vacation several times. We text daily, We've talked about her school and her career and this is what is messing me up. I feel a strong connection but I also realize it's her job... and I'm paying her. The problem for me is that she's now done with school and is ready to move back home to begin her career and quit being an escort. She told me all this during Christmas... She bought me a Playstation 5 for Christmas! Wtf.. she said it was a thank you for being a great client all these years and she said she is gonna miss me. She said that even though I was a client I always made her feel special. She said she is gonna miss venting to me and appreciated me always listening to her...She said she is planning on making the move this spring.

I really think she has feelings too.. but I don't know... maybe she's really good at her job  . It's probably a Longshot, but I'd love to be in a real relationship with her... hell I'd even relocate with her.  Should I tell her I love her? I'm 40, no kids, I don't have a lot of close friends... All I have is my career. What do I have to lose? I don’t really know. Then again, if this is all just a part of her job as an escort I don't want to make her feel awkward.. "
"  teacher wrongly blamed child for breaking another teacher's nose, causing confusion and anger until a formal apology was received.","What did your child’s teacher tell you that made no sense?

What did your child’s teacher tell you that made NO SENSE? “He broke his nose with a bat.” This was said to my mom regarding my younger brother. It confused my mom, because, for a first, though my brother had his anger issues, he'd never actually physically assault someone, because he doesn't have a mean bone in his body and, secondly, he wasn't outside when it had taken place. So, to properly explain. It was winter, nearing Christmas, and my brother was about 8 years old, placing him in 3rd grade, I think. So, my brother had asthma. He's grown out of it a while ago, but at the time, it was fairly bad. He couldn't even be outside when it was too cold and if he was outside, he had to have a mask that covered his nose and his mouth. On this particular day, it was colder than usual and so, my mother sent a message to his teacher saying that he couldn't be outside during lunch, unless they really wanted a trip to the hospital.
So, during lunch, he stayed inside and my mom knew he was inside. Then, she got a call later that day from the principal, saying that my brother had just hit a teacher with a bat and broken his nose during lunch. This couldn't be right, my mom thought, but she just replied that she´ll talk to him when he comes home. So, home he gets, understandably upset, and she asks him, “What happened at school?” He looked frustrated as he replied back, “I didn't do it! It wasn't me!” He was almost to the point of tears, and my mom took a look at his face and believed him. When everyone else didn't, she took his word for it because she knew her child and though his anger could be fierce, he wouldn't hurt someone and she knew when he was lying. Plus the fact that he was supposed to be inside when this took place. So, she calls the principal, tells her her opinion and demands a meeting to resolve the problem. So they have a meeting. Just so you aren't confused, during lunch in which my brother was inside, a teacher was with him because he couldn't very well be alone. This teacher was my brother's favorite teacher and I quite liked him as well. He was pretty cool. He vouched for my brother, swore he was with him all the time, but no one cared for what he had to say because the school was SH T like that. Now, the teacher that had actually gotten his nose broken hadn't said much on this matter, but another teacher, who had been my teacher at the time, was the one who put the blame on my brother. She was adamant he did it. So my mother, quite angrily and very pissed off, showed her a picture of my brother, looked her in the eyes and asked her, very clearly, “Is this the one who did it?” It wasn't. Of course, it wasn't. The teacher with the broken nose looked confused as he said that it was not and my teacher just burst into tears when she realized she'd accused the wrong child, because they both thought they had been talking about the same child when it was my teacher who misunderstood. My mother wasn't very sympathetic when she cried though, and neither was I really. She's always been a pretty SH T teacher and a bully as well. No one liked her. It turned out, it was another child with the same name as my brother who was the culprit. He was a bully, a problematic child. It was just easier to blame my brother because he was a bit difficult when he was younger. Anger issues and all. Though he never really hurt anyone, at least not with intent as it was usually an accident, he could be violent if he wanted to. He was a sweet kid though, he was just misunderstood. But because of this, my teacher assumed it to be my brother without any actual evidence to support it, even when the evidence proved the complete opposite. I really don't know how it got to be as messed up as it was, how they could make such a stupid and, in my opinion, obvious mistake, but my mom refused to let my brother go to school before they got a formal apology. We got a letter, but that wasn't good enough in my mom's opinion. It took a week before they got the hint and my teacher, the one who accused him in the first place, along with the teacher whose nose was broken both came knocking on our door early one morning and apologized. They walked him to school. My mom's still pretty pissed about it and it's been about 5 years now."
"  mother's dilemma: Wants older daughter included in younger daughter's wedding, but faces resistance from both daughters. Family conflict ensues.","AITA for trying to get my daughter to include her sister in the wedding?

Am I the ayy hole for trying to get my daughter to include her sister in the wedding? My younger daughter got engaged earlier in the year. Her fiancé is a wonderful man and I’m thrilled for her. My older daughter has been single for quite some time. Naturally, we always expected that my Sarah would get married first, and I feel terrible for her that she’s watching her sister live out her dream wedding without one of her own in sight. I tried to convince Louise to put off her wedding until after her sister was married, but both my girls thought that was ridiculous so I didn’t push. Louise's dress appointment is coming up in a few weeks, and both Sarah and myself were invited. I called Sarah the other day to check on her and see if she would rather go on a fun mother-daughter day with me if it was too painful. Sarah said that she was perfectly fine and that we should be there to support Louise, which is so kind of her but I feel as though she’s just trying to put on a brave face, so I suggested that while we were there, she try on a few dresses so it could feel like her moment too. Sarah said that it was a terrible idea and that the focus should be entirely on Louise, and that she genuinely doesn’t care that Louise is getting married first. She even said that she enjoys being single and doesn’t know if she ever plans to marry, which breaks my heart because I’ve been dreaming about my oldest daughter’s wedding my whole life. Sarah has apparently told Louise about my suggestion, and Louise now wants to uninvite me from the appointment. I feel like Louise is being insensitive to her sister and my brother and SIL agree, but Sarah is on her side. EDIT: I’m not trying to imply that a woman can’t be happy on her own. I simply believe that given Sarah’s personality, she would really want a wedding for herself. She enjoys grandeur while Louise enjoys simpler pleasures. In my dreams of my daughter’s wedding, I always envisioned a classic, grand wedding while Louise’s wedding is shaping up to be more of a formal get-together. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it has Louise written all over it. Of course I support unmarried women. I also love both daughters equally, but I think since Louise is receiving so much attention, love, and support at this time, she can spare some of my attention for Sarah."

","AITA for making my stepson sleep on the sleeper sofa in the living room?

Am I the ayy hole for making my stepson sleep on the sleeper sofa in the living room? I have 3 children from a previous relationship, my first wife died 8 years ago. My now wife has 3 children from her previous marriage. We started dating 7 years ago and married 5 years ago. We are currently on vacation because my oldest has spring break from his freshman year of college. We are staying in our vacation home a few states away. Our vacation home only has 3 bedrooms, one for my wife and I, one for the boys and one for the girls. The issue is there has been conflict between my 2 stepsons, Brecken and Kurt. Brecken and Kurt have never gotten along according to my wife but it’s gotten real bad lately and they’re in family therapy for it. Brecken is a good kid, very sweet, he’s definitely the most likely to challenge authority but not always in a bad way. Kurt is more quiet and obedient but he’s had some issues with being nice to others. The conflict started when my oldest was talking to Kurt and showing him his phone. Kurt's interests overlap a lot more with my son than Brecken, so they wanted to bond over vacation. The issue came when Kurt was showing my son some texts he sent his friends, this included some truly vile stuff including prejudice against Brecken’s girlfriend and mocking some of his baseball teammates. Brecken’s girlfriend is african-american, the district we are in is over 90% white. Our family is white. The texts Kurt sent included the n word and were just awful. Kurt fully knows better than this, he has a high IQ, into some advanced topics like coding and trivia and has even been considered to be a possible grade skipper (he’s in 5th now), but we haven’t because we didn’t want to stunt social growth. When we got out of the van, my son said he wanted to talk to me and showed my wife and I the texts. We called Kurt in and he didn’t show any remorse. He made a big deal out of us calling him in which led us to have to explain everything to all of the kids. Brecken, who almost always smiles, was angrier than I’ve ever seen before. Brecken told us he didn’t want to be near Kurt and locked him out of the room the boys are supposed to stay in. My wife and I agreed that it was best that the 2 didn’t stay in the room together. The couch in the living room is a sleeper sofa, so we told Kurt he needed to sleep there to prevent fights. We thought this was ok, obviously Kurt was mad at us but we were surprised when the girls started saying we were being “too hard” on Kurt and that we should just let him apologize to Brecken. Brecken said he wouldn’t accept an apology because “you can hurt me, but you can’t hurt my girl or my boys”. We also thought forcing an apology was bad but the girls keep guilt tripping us. He slept on the sofa last night and was a real pain about it."
  the narrator is concerned about their sister's behavior towards their girlfriend and the possibility of romantic feelings developing between them.,"I am worried that my sister has feelings for my girlfriend

My girlfriend and I have been together for 2 and a half years and we have a really great relationship. My sister and I have always been close so I was really happy when she and my girlfriend met and hit it off right away. They get along insanely well and it's awesome, or was awesome. They are also both bi. Everything was normal up until about 3 months ago. They started hanging out together more often than usual, taking day trips and having sleepovers and going for dinner. I didn't care about it initially, I thought it was cool that the 2 most important women in my life were such good friends. Then my sister Amy started making comments saying that if we ever broke up she'd be first in line to date my girlfriend Emily. She calls Emily her wifey and follows her around like a lost puppy. Amy says that Emily is our girlfriend and I swear she gets jealous when I interact with her. Then last week I got home from work and as I walked through the door I could hear them chatting in the living room, this isn't out of the ordinary. It was what I heard that really bothered me. My sister said ""Holy crap. I have such a crush on you."" in the most lustful voice I've ever heard. Emily laughed and their conversation moved on but it really didn't sit well with me so later on I asked Emily what they were talking about, she told me that they went shopping earlier in the day and were doing a little fashion show for each other. She said that those kinds of comments are normal between girl friends and it's nothing to worry about. It made sense to me and I trust Emily. I decided to talk to Amy. I asked how their shopping spree went and then gently asked her what the crush comment was about, she got very defensive and accused me of being jealous of her relationship with Emily then told me to ""grow the eff up"". I'm not worried about Emily doing anything behind my back to betray me and I never have. There's just something about the way my sister is acting that irks me and I don't know how to approach this without blowing up any of our relationships."

","AITA for getting my girlfriend kicked out of the country?

I have been dating my girlfriend for 5 years. We met in college where she was an international student. She started working after graduating while I am currently doing a masters. Her company was sponsoring her visa until they got bought out and she got laid off. She was given a limited time to find a new employer to sponsor her a new visa and it really stressed her out. She was applying to jobs every day and did a lot of interviews but unfortunately, wasn't able to get an offer. She really wanted to stay since she loves the place and I would still be here in the country. While I was out with a buddy he suggested that I sponsor her visa since we have been in a relationship for quite some time. I love her and I didn't want to see her so stressed out I told her about the idea. She was hesitant at first. She said she didn't want me to think that she was with me so I could be her way to a permanent residence in the country. I wanted her to stay and I wanted to do it. We consulted an immigration consultant and decided to do the paperwork on our own. She was the one who mostly looked into the stuff we needed to prepare. She still applied for jobs but not as urgently as she used to. It took a while since we never really had anything joint. We live together and just split the bills on our own. She had saved up enough to be okay for a while. I had to fill out some paperwork to be her sponsor and I felt uneasy about it. I did want her to stay but it felt like it was too much. Eventually, she was done with her part and all that was left was mine. I finally told her that I didn't want to go through with it. She was very upset and asked why. I told her that I suggested the idea because I didn't want to see her stressed out all the time, and that I eventually realized that I shouldn't have to be responsible for her. We had a long talk where I told her that I still want to be in a relationship with her but I just don't want to be forced to be responsible for her. She said she felt very hurt by what I said. Things changed and she didn't really talk to me after. She kept applying for jobs and attending interviews but eventually her visa expired. Before she left, I told her I love her and that I would really want her to come back. However, she told me that she sees me differently after the things I told her. It has been a few weeks since she left. I miss her cooking, her presence, and being able to spend time with her. I still want a future with her."
